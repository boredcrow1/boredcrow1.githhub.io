Peter:
 Everybody I've got bad news. We've been cancelled.

Lois:
 Oh no Peter! How could they do that?

Peter:
 Well unfortuantely Lois, there's just no more room on the schedule. We just gotta accept the fact that FOX has to make room for terrific shows like Dark Angel, Titus, Undeclared, Action, That 80's Show, Wonder Falls, Fast Lane, Andy Richter Controls The Universe, Skin, Girl's Club, Cracking Up, The Pitts, Firefly, Get Real, Freaky Links, Wanda At Large, Costello, The Lone Gunman, A Minute with Stan Hooper, Normal Ohio, Pasadena, Harsh Realm, Keen Eddy, The Street, American Embassy, Cedric The Entertainer, The Tick, Louie, And Greg The Bunny....

Lois:
 Is there no hope?

Peter:
 Well I suppose if ALL those shows go down the tubes we might have a shot.

Peter:
 (Walks out of the bathroom and wanders into another room. He walks into the room and walks behind the bed. We find out that this is Chris' room.) Hey, you still awake, Lois honey? (Peter lays down into Chris' bed.)

Chris:
 Dad?

Peter:
 That's right, I'm your daddy. Shh, Shh, Shh, Shh. Don't talk, Lois, don't talk. Just let me do all the work. Yeah...now feel my warm breath on the nape of your neck. My hands on your big soft boobs...running down your big man-like chest. (Peter jumps up.) Holy crap, It's Chris!! Uhh...Uhh...So, uhh...How ya doin'? You do all your homework?

Chris:
 (nods his head.)

Peter:
 Finish all your subjects?

Chris:
 Yes, sir.

Peter:
 Good, just uhh, just checkin'. (Backs towards the door.) Have a good night son. (Walks down the hall.)

Peter:
 You still awake honey?

Stewie:
 What the deuce?

Peter:
 Excuse me, is your refrigerator running?

Peter:
 I'll handle it, Lois. I read a book about this sort of thing once.

Brian:
 Are you sure it was a book? Are you sure it wasn't nothing?

Peter:
 Oh yeah.

Peter:
 Well, I'm gettin' something really special too. And by special I don't mean special like that Kleinaman boy down the street. More special like... like Special K, the cereal. Hey, what do they do with the regular K? And for that matter, what ever happend to K. Ballard? You know, if you said mallard and you had a cold, it would sound like ballard.

Brian:
 Do you listen to yourself when you talk?

Peter:
 I drift in and out.

Cleaveland:
 Hey Peter, are you up for another snow cone?

Peter:
 No thanks, that yellow snow cone you gave me didn't taste like lemon, it tasted more like...oh you guys are asses!

Vacuum repairman:
 There you go, all fixed. Turns out a half-eaten meatball was clogging up the intake.

Peter:
 Oh. Well, did you save it?

Vacuum repairman:
 Uh, no.

Peter:
 You bastard.

Chris:
 Dad, what's the blow-hole for?

Peter:
 I'll tell you what it's not for, son. And when I do, you'll understand why I can never go back to Sea World.

Peter:
 Are you gonna eat that stapler?

TV Executive:
 You...can't eat a stapler.

Peter:
 Wanna split it?

Meg:
 I just want to kill myself I'm gonna go upstairs and eat a whole bowl of peanuts.

Meg:
 I'm allergic to peanuts.

Meg:
 You dont know anything about me. (runs upstairs)

Peter:
 Who was that guy?

Dennis Miller:
 I don't wanna go on a RANT here but America's foreign policy makes about as much sense as Beowolf having sex with Robert Fulton at the first Battle of Antetum. I mean when a neo-conservative defenstrates it's like Raskalnakov filibuster dioxymonohydrostinate.

Peter:
 What the hell does RANT mean?

Lois:
 You're drunk again.

Peter:
 No, I'm just exhausted 'cause I've been up all night drinking.

Brian:
 That's... that's not a riddle. That's ... that's just terrible.

Peter:
 No, the rest were from the family. Weren't they? (Pauses.) Oh crap...since when did they change the meaning of "for" to "from"?

Brian:
 They had a meeting about it last night.

Peter:
 Why wasn't I told?

Brian:
 They sent you a card, but it said "for Peter" on it so you must of thought it was from you, so you didn't...you know, its just easier to call you stupid.

Lois:
 Peter, did you paste a new picture of yourself on our wedding picture?

Peter:
 Yeah I think it looks better.

Lois:
 You pasted it over me.

Peter:
 Can't we tell them that your mother died?

Lois:
 Peter, I'm not gonna lie about something like that.

Peter:
 All right, all right, I'll kill your mother.

 I'd like to propose a toast to our neighbors. Sure they might be black, handicapped, and a heartless sex hound, but hey, if they moved out some smelly Hawaiians might move in.

Peter:
 Alright here's a riddle, a mother has two children, and an axe murderer says she can keep one. Which one does she let die?

Lois:
 Peter, that's not a joke, that's just horrible!

Peter:
 Wrong the ugly one!

Peter:
 I've got an idea! An idea so smart that my head would explode if I even began to know what I'm talking about.

 Okay.

 A boat's a boat but a box could be anything! It could even be a boat!

 Well, we promised Lois we'd use our powers responsibly, but I suppose doing the exact opposite couldn't hurt.

Peter:
 HOLY CRAP! I'm communticating with nature! Uh, tree, if one of you falls and no one is around to hear you, do you make a noise?

 What? It's a ladder, he can't use it. It's like takin' a watch off a dead guy.

 Our children are our greatest treasure. They deserve a school board president who doesn't leave her feminine ointments in the fridge next to the mustard. That was the worst sandwich I ever ate! She flosses in bed. She snores like a wildebeast. She freed Willie Horton. She nailed Donna Rice.

 No no Lois, it's time I joined the ranks of great men with beards. Why do you think Jesus Christ was so popular? Cause ... cause of all the magic tricks?

Peter:
 First of all Bonnie, you've been pregnant for like 6 years! Are you gonna have the baby or not?

Peter:
 You gotta help me Brian. Teach me how to be a gentleman.

Brian:
 Well, Peter, it's not really that hard. Let's start with polite conversation. For example, 'it's a pleasure to see you again. Lovely weather we're having.' Now you try.

Peter:
 'It's a pleasure to see you again. After Hogan's Heroes, Bob Crane got his skull crushed in by a friend who videotaped him having rough sex.' How's that?

Brian:
 Wow. Perfect. My work is done. But just for the heck of it, let's try it again.

Peter:
 You know what's funny? I always thought that dogs laid eggs, and I learned something today.

Peter:
 The lesson here is that abusing alcohol has absolutely no negative consequences. You have your trophy and my brain cells are just fine.

Lois:
 Hey I know, lets play a game. Now I'm thinking of a movie.

Meg:
 Is it an action movie?

Chris:
 Who's in the movie?

Peter:
 Wait, is it a good movie?

Lois:
 Eh, it has its moments.

Peter:
 Cool Runnings

Lois:
 Yep!

Peter:
 If you want an autograph right now, you either got to give me a pen or some snow.

Peter:
 I am Neptune, God of the Sea. I sink ships and conjure up storms.

King Neptune:
 No you're not, I am!

Peter:
 You don't have to quit the force. I mean, you could get a desk job. Eh? You could be a desk.

Lois:
 Brian, you're not wearing the sweater I made you.

Peter:
 Well, y'know, it's a little warm in here ...

Lois:
 "Don we now our gay apparel."

Peter:
 It doesn't get much gayer than this.

Peter:
 I saw you in that coffee shop, breaking the fifth commandment. Congress passes these things for a reason, Lois.

Chris:
 What's a library, dad?

Peter:
 Oh, it's just a place where homeless people come to shave and go BM.

Peter:
 I feel kinda guilty, giving Chris his first taste of beer...but you turned out okay, right pal?

Chris:
 I'm gonna go get wasted.

Peter:
 I think the lesson here is, it really doesn't matter where you're from, as long as we're all the same religion.

Peter:
 Lois, my penis belongs on stage!

Quagmire:
 Peter, I can remember a dozen times when you've saved our asses

Peter Griffin:
 Yeah, too bad I got there after the sodomy.

Lois:
 Now kids, your father's just trying to spend time with his family. Or kill us. I'm not sure which.

Peter:
 Our sex is so dull for you that you gotta fantasize about George Clooney?

Lois:
 I'm sorry honey, I guess that things have become a little...stale for me.

Peter:
 Well, I-I don't know what to do. I mean, I don't really know that much about any kinky stuff. I mean, I-I could hook this car battery up to my nipples. (Hooks car battery to both his nipples.)

Peter:
 Ahh, Ahh, Ahh, Oh God, Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow there's 240-Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow!

Peter:
 (Sees a city worker putting up a "Special Dad" sign in their front yard that has a picture of a dad chasing a ball across the street.) Why are they trying to publicly humiliate-- ooh, shiny red ball. (Peter chases after the ball into the street causing cars to crash into each other.)

Peter:
 Your aunt Marguerite is probably laughing at me while she's burning in hell, may she rest in peace.

Peter:
 Wow, when you're beautiful doors magically open for you!

s Club Man:
 Actually, it opened because you stepped on that black square.

Lois:
 I'm sorry for everything that's happened Peter. I guess I'm going through a phase right now where I'm only attracted to handsome men.

Peter:
 Well what are we supposed to do Lois? Just admitt that there's no excitement left in our marriage, go home and spend the rest of our lives looking at each other across the breakfast table talking about how much we both like Total?

Lois:
 Ooh, I love Total!

Peter:
 Ooh, actually so do I, and it's healthy for us too. OH GOD ITS STARTIN' ALREADY!

Peter:
 (singing to children at Sunday school): Jesus loves me... He loves me a bunch... he always puts Skippy in my lunch

Lois:
 Peter, you're bribing your daughter with a car?

Peter:
 Ah, c'mon, Lois, isn't "bribe" just another word for "love?"

Peter:
 I feel terrible Brian, I put Lois in a hospital and I lost the kids. This is turning out worse than Stewie's IPOD commercial.

Peter:
 Did you hear that, Lois? We're goin' to Hollywood, where the people are sexy and clever and they always say somethin' funny right before the commercial break.

Lois:
 To hell with the cameras! How could we ever let them replace our little girl? Oh, I miss her, Peter.

Peter:
 Me, too. She's like that dorky Baldwin brother who isn't as good-looking or successful and never answers my letters, but he's still a Baldwin, damn it!

Peter:
 I'm just a big fake, like the moon landing and Marky Mark's hog in Boogie Nights and Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. I don't mean that completely unproved gay rumor, they're just both really phony.

Peter:
 Stand aside. Its time for me to fufill my fatherly duty. HAHA i said duty but no time to laugh about it now.

Lois:
 Peter say hello to your daughter.

Peter:
 Oh my God! I'm sorry Lois. It was twenty years ago. I never heard the word rubber uh--

Lois:
 No, Peter this is Meg.

Peter:
 OH! Welcome to the family sweetheart, Chris throw out all of Megs old pictures.

Car salesman:
 I'm Doug. Nice to meet you. Whoa, have you lost weight??

Peter:
 No, it's still there, I'm just parting it on the side.

Peter:
 You know for a large heavy-set black guy, Cleveland's got a cute little white ass.

Peter:
 Oh man, Lois is really pissed at me

Brian:
 Yeah, who knew welfare fraud was one of her buttons?

Peter:
 My name is Peter Griffin...my friends call me Peter for short.

Death:
 Yeah, it's somewhere in the car.

Peter:
 Well then you know that I ran a semester of track! (Peter starts running.)

Weinstein:
What do you want?

Peter:
 Financial advice.

Weinstein:
 Fiancial Advice? How the hell do you know I'm an accountant?

Peter:
 Hello! Max Weinstein?!

Peter:
 Huh, whoever thought that getting drunk at a stag party would get me $150,000 dollars a week from the government?

Brian:
 That's why I don't vote.

Peter:
 Heh, maybe someone down there was drinking too eh?

Reporter:
 Uh, Mr. President, why do you think that the American public continues to support you throughout these impeachment precedings?

Clinton:
 Uh, Probably cuz your so fat! (laughing) Uh huh huh huh huh huh.

 Stevenson:
 The bank said you wouldn't have the money, because your a dead beat loser.

Peter:
 A dead beat loser? Well sir, I may not agree with what you say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it.

Peter:
 There's gotta be an explanation for all this.

Brian:
 You want an explanation? God is pissed!

Peter:
 Lois, this is my new friend Max Weinstein! He's Jewish!

Lois:
 Ooooooooh, how exotic!

Peter:
 Just a small town girl...livin' in a lonely world. She took a midnight train goin' anywhere.

Cleveland:
 No, no i couldn't. Well ok. Just a city boy... born and raise in south Detroit...

Man:
 Hey it's Journey!

People at funeral:
 Hey it's Journey! Let's go!

Peter:
 This is great. Not only did I live long enough to see Meg go to her first dance but I'm taking her too. Thanks, Geritol.

Peter:
 How many monkeys does it take to screw in a light bulb? Three--one to screw it in and two to throw feces at each other.

Peter:
 Tonight Katie Couric guest stars as a very perky crack whore.

Peter to Connie:
 Sweet statutory, you look beautiful.

Lois:
 Oh, "The Old Man and the Sea". I see you're getting in the mood for our cruise.

Peter:
 Yeah. Stupid fisherman, sitting out there on a boat yammering to himself. He doesn't even know I'm watching him.

Peter:
 Everyone knows there are only two things that can survive a nuclear holocaust: cockroaches and Twinkies. And there's a Twinkie factory in Natick!

Peter:
 You ever watch that show Scrubs? Lois had it on the other night, and I was kinda fading in and out, you know. I was watching and wondering..... which one is the funny guy?

Peter:
 Dad, to be honest, I don't like you either. Aw, jeez, that's a terrible thing to say. I guess I am going to hell, huh.

The Pope:
 Peter, the good lord said to honor thy father. He never said anything about liking him.

Peter:
 No bird frenches my wife and gets away with it.

Peter:
 If Liza is wrong, then I don't want to know what right is.

Jan:
 Mom, Dad, I found cigarettes in Greg's jacket.

Mike:
 Greg, were you smoking cigarettes?

Greg:
 No, Dad.

Mike:
 Well, he's lying. There's no doubt about that.

Mike:
 Greg, I'm afraid your punishment will be four hours in the snakepit.

Mike:
 Now maybe that'll give you some time to think about what you've done.

Greg:
 Aw, man!

Jan:
 That'll teach him.

Mike:
 And Jan, I'm afraid you've earned a day in the chamber of fire... for tattling on your brother.

Peter:
 Well, they live in a crummy neighborhood.

Brian:
 The Bradys?

Woman:
 You folks want some pancakes?

Peter:
 No, thank you. See, that's the worst we got is, uh, Jemima's Witnesses.

Meg:
 Mom, my lips are too thin. Can I please get collagen injections?

Lois:
 Meg, you don't need to change the way you look. You know, most of the world's problems stem from poor self-image.

Stewie:
 Excellent! The mind-control device is nearing completion!

Lois:
 Stewie, I said no toys at the table.

Stewie:
 Damn you, vile woman! You've impeded my work since the day I escaped from your wretched womb.

Lois:
 Oh, don't pout, honey. You know, when you were born... the doctor said you were the happiest looking baby he's ever seen.

Stewie:
 But, of course, that was my victory day. The fruition of my deeply-laid plans... to escape from that cursed ovarian bastille! Return the device, woman!

Lois:
 No toys, Stewie.

Stewie:
 Very well, then. Mark my words: when you least expect it, you uppance will come!

Meg:
 Mom, can I turn the heat up?

Lois:
 Oh, don't touch the thermostat, Meg. Your father gets upset.

Meg:
 Come on. This thing goes up to 90.

Peter:
 Who touched the thermostat?

Meg:
 God, how does he always know?

Peter:
 Brain implant, Meg. Every father's got one. Tells you when the children are messing with the dial.

Peter:
 Yeah, it's all right.

Brian:
 Whoa, ass ahoy. Hey, Peter, it's 7:00 and you've still got your pants on. What's the occasion?

Lois:
 He's going to a stag party.

Peter:
 Now Lois, I work hard all week to provide for this family. I am the man of the house. And as the man, I order you to give me permission to go to this party.

Lois:
 Look, at least promise me you won't drink. Alcohol always leads to trouble.

Peter:
 Come on. You're worrying about nothing.

Lois:
 Oh? Remember when you got drunk off the Communion wine at church?

Priest:
 And so the Lord God smote poor Job... with festering boils all over his body.

God:
 Oh man, I hate it when he tells this story.

Priest:
 Yet, miraculously, Job was still able to retain his dignity.

Peter:
 ***coughs*** Whoa, is that really the blood of Christ?

Peter:
 Man, that guy must have been wasted 24 hours a day.

Lois:
 And then there was that time at the ice cream store.

Peter:
 Oh, Butter Rum's my favorite.

Brian:
 And remember when you had an Irish coffee the day we went to see Philadelphia?

Peter:
 I got it. That's the guy from Big. Tom Hanks, that's it. Aw, funny guy, Tom Hanks. Everything he says is a stitch.

 character:
 I have AIDS.

Peter:
 ***laughing hysterically*** ta ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

Lois:
 Promise me, Peter.

Peter:
 Lois, honey, I promise. Not a drop of alcohol is gonna touch these lips tonight.

Quagmire:
 Hey, who wants to play "Drink The Beer"?

Peter:
 Right here.

Quagmire:
 You win.

Peter:
 All right. What do I win?

Quagmire:
 Another beer!

Peter:
 Oh, I'm going for the high score.

Quagmire:
 Well actually, Charlie's got the high score.

Charlie:
 Hey, man. Your clock won't flush.

Peter:
 Heh. You know, I feel kind of bad, you guys. I promised my wife I wouldn't drink.

Quagmire:
 Oh, don't feel bad, Peter.

Peter:
 Oh, gee. I never thought of it like that.

Random Perv:
 Hey, did you bring the porno?

Peter:
 Did I bring the porno huh?

Peter:
 You're gonna love it. It's a classic.

Rick:
 Listen to me, Ilsa. If I take this thing out... and you're not on it, you'll regret it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow. But soon, and for the rest of your life.

Peter:
 Oh, come on, Ilsa! Get on!

Movie Narrator:
 The statue was originally a gift from France.

Charlie:
 What is this?

Peter:
 Oh, man. My kid must've taped over this for history class.

Random Perv:
 The Statue of Liberty? What are we gonna do?

Peter:
 Boys, boys, we're gonna drink until she's hot.

Quagmire:
 Hey, that's just crazy enough to work.

Lois:
 Meg, finish your pancakes.

Lois:
 Chris, elbows off your father.

Peter:
 Thanks, son.

Lois:
 37 beers. You're setting a great example for the kids, Peter.

Chris:
 Yeah. A new family record. Way to raise the bar, dad.

Lois:
 Chris, you're 13. Don't talk like that.

Lois:
 Peter, what did you promise me last night?

Peter:
 Drank at the stag... oh ***laughs*** I almost walked right into that one. Oh, God!

Peter:
 It feels like there's accountants are cranking adding machines in my head.

Paul:
 Dick, you ever wonder what's outside those walls?

Dick:
 Say now, that's dangerous thinking, Paul. You best stick to your work.

Paul:
 ***quick laugh*** Okay.

Lois:
 You see, Peter? A hangover is nature's way of telling you I was right. I mean...

Meg:
 Mom, are you all right?

Lois:
 My goodness. This chair leg was loose. Isn't that silly? I could've broken my neck.

Stewie:
 Damn!

Peter:
 Look, honey. I took a cab home, I slept on the table so I wouldn't wake you up. Nothing bad happened.

Lois:
 Well, I... I guess you're right.

Peter:
 Apology accepted. All right, I'm going to work. Somebody's gotta put food on this table.

Johnson:
 Well Mr. Weed, I've been working on the new G.I. Jew line. And as you can see, they look great.

Johnson:
 Whoa! I'm glad he's on our side!

 Weed:
 Peter!

Peter:
 What?!

 Weed:
 Are you sleeping on the job?

Peter:
 ***staggering*** No. There's a bug in my eye and I'm trying to suffocate him.

 Weed:
 Peter, I like you. But I need you to be more than just eye candy around here. It's your job to watch for any toys that could be hazardous to children. Now look sharp!

Peter:
 Yes, sir!

Diane Simmons:
 And now Back to Action 5 News. Our top story tonight, "When Toys Attack." Quite a situation we've got here, Tom.

Tom Tucker:
 Quite a situation we've got here, Tom, indeed, Diane. It seems the Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Company of Quahog, Rhode Island has released several highly unsafe products into the retail market.

Batter:
 Come on, Timmy! Throw the Silly Ball!

Boy:
 Oh boy! A Pound Poochie!

Girl:
 Come on, Baby Heimlich, spit it out.

 Weed:
 Peter, I am appalled. Your negligence has damaged this company's reputation. You're fired!

Peter:
 Aw, jeez. For how long?

Meg:
 Oh my God! You got fired?

Chris:
 Way to go, Dad! Fight the machine!

Stewie:
 How do you know about the machine?

Peter:
 Now don't worry, kids. Your father's still gonna put food on this table. Just not as much. So it might get a little competitive.

Meg:
 Who cares about food? Now we'll never be able to afford my lip injections!

Brian:
 Hey, uh, Peter, can we put her out in the yard for a while?

Lois:
 Okay, who's hungry?

Peter:
 Oh, jeez. How the hell am I gonna break this to Lois? If she finds out I got fired for drinking, she's gonna blame me!

s Devil:
 Lie to her. It's okay to lie to women. They're not people like us.

Peter:
 Oh, I don't know.

Peter:
 Hey, where's the other guy?

s Angel:
 Come on, you bastard! I'm late for work.

s Angel:
 Oh, this perfect!

Peter:
 Look, I don't want your mom to worry, all right? When she worries, she says, "I told you so" and, "Stop doing that. I'm asleep." So I'm just gonna tell a little lie, okay? Now, not a word to your mom about me getting canned.

Lois:
 What's that, Peter?

Peter:
 Uh, nothing. The lost-my-job smells great.

Peter:
 Uh, Meg, honey, can you pass the fired-my-ass-for-negligence?

Lois:
 Peter, are you feeling okay?

Peter:
 I feel great! I haven't got a job in the world.

Lois:
 All right, then let's eat. Now I know you all hate eggplant, but--

Lois:
 What on earth was that?

Stewie:
 What the deuce are you staring at? It's tuna fish... and nothing else.

Brian:
 How's your job search going?

Peter:
 It sucks, Brian. I've already been through two jobs this week. I got fired off of that commercial.

Director:
 Try it again.

Peter:
 I'm caca for Cuckoo Puffs.

Director:
 No, damn it! Take 26!

Peter:
 Yeah, then I had that job as the sneeze guard for the salad bar at that restaurant.

Old Lady:
 aaa-- aaa-- aaa--

Peter:
 Take it outside, lady.

Peter:
 Yeah, then I thought I could win some money in that talent show.

Emcee:
 And the prize goes to The von Trapp Family Singers!

Peter:
 That is bull--

Brian:
 Peter, I know it's a dangerous precedent, but you might want to just tell Lois the truth.

Peter:
 What? That I can't provide for my family? That she's always right? That I didn't really stand up to that tank in Tiananmen Square?

Peter:
 Aw, screw this! I just came over to buy some fireworks!

Brian:
 Peter, you can't keep lying to her about losing your job. Sooner or later, she'll find out where you're really going every day.

Peter:
 Oh, yeah.

Peter:
 Yeah, you're right. Okay, I'll tell her tonight.

Stewie:
 Victory is mine!

Stewie:
 Aahh!

Lois:
 Peter, I'll need the checkbook in the morning. I'm going to Stop 'N Shop for some sweet corn.

Peter:
 You're spending money on food again? Lois, we just had dinner.

Lois:
 Well you know, I enjoyed it so much, I thought we'd eat again tomorrow. Since when are you so concerned about our food budget?

Peter:
 Well, I just... Lois, this is really hard for me to say, but...

Lois:
 What is it, Peter?

Peter:
 I... uh... you're getting kind of fat.

Peter:
 It's just... It's not healthy.

Lois:
 Peter, I do my Jane Fonda workout tape three times a week. When was the last time you saw your toes?

Peter:
 Gee, man, I thought you people were supposed to be jolly.

Lois:
 Peter, what the hell is the matter with you? Honey, you know, if there's something wrong, you can tell me.

s Angel:
 Hey uh, sorry man. Am I late. What did I miss?

Peter:
 Thank God you're here. What do I do?

s Devil:
 Tell him to keep quiet. He's in too deep.

s Angel:
 Oh, I don't know.

s Angel:
 Hey, where's the other guy?

s Angel:
 Ah, this is unbelievable!

Peter:
 Lois, I promise you, everything's fine. You got nothing to worry about.

Stewie:
 Well, well, mother! We meet again!

Lois:
 Stewie, I thought I tucked you an hour ago.

Stewie:
 Not tightly enough it would seem. And now you contempible harpy, I shall end your oppressive reign of matriarchal tyranny.

Lois:
 You can play with your toys tomorrow, honey. Right now it's bedtime.

Stewie:
 Oh, blast you and your estrogenical treachery!

Peter:
 Sweet dreams, kiddo.

Stewie:
 You have the power to end this!

Brian:
 Hey, how'd she take it?

Peter:
 I told her she was fat.

Brian:
 No.

Peter:
 Look, I hate lying to Lois. It's just... It's the best way to keep her from knowing the truth.

Brian:
 Peter, you don't have a choice. Your unemployment is going to dry up soon. And she'll probably sense something's amiss when they repossess your house. You really oughta think of your family's welfare.

Peter:
 Jeez, Brian! That's a great idea!

Welfare Employee:
 Okay, do you have any disabilities, past injuries, physical anomalies?

Peter:
 Uh... Oh, I didn't have gas for the first time until I was 30.

Peter:
 Guys, our money problems are over! We're officially on welfare. Come on kids, help me scatter car parts on the front lawn.

Brian:
 Uh, how much are we getting?

Peter:
 Let's see. $150 a week.

Meg:
 Wait. That's a comma, not a decimal.

Peter:
 Whoops.

Lois:
 No, I haven't seen Peter all afternoon. I was giving a piano lesson.

Lois:
 Stewie, why don't you play in the other room?

Lois:
 Well, no dessert for you, young man.

Peter:
 Boy, who would've thought getting drunk at a stag party would get me $150,000 a week from the government?

Brian:
 This is why I don't vote.

Peter:
 Hey, maybe somebody down there was drinking, too.

Reporter:
 Mr. President, why do you think the American public has continued to support you throughout these impeachment proceedings?

Brian:
 Peter, you might want to call the Welfare Commission. That check is obviosly an oversight.

Peter:
 Well, not necessarily. Maybe I'm like their one millionth customer.

Brian:
 On what?

Lois:
 Oh, my God! Peter, you bought the statue of David?

Peter:
 No, I just rented it. But they're gonna be ticked. The penis broke off while I was loading it into the car.

 Weed:
 ***picking up the object*** I shall call you "Eduardo."

Lois:
 Peter, how can we afford this?

Chris:
 You're not going to believe it, Mom! Dad's getting--

Peter:
 A big raise!

Lois:
 Peter, that's wonderful!

Chris:
 But, Dad, I thought--

Peter:
 The kind of a big raise that'll allow me to give my kids a big allowance just for keeping their big mouths shut. Come on, you guys. I'm going to buy us the most expensive meal we've ever had.

Peter:
 Yeah, I'd like 6,000 chicken fa-ji-tas, please.

Clerk:
 I beg your pardon?

Peter:
 ***pointing to Chicken Fajitas*** Uh, 6,000 chicken fa-ji-tas.

Brian:
 And a "So-sage" McBiscuit please.

Lois:
 Peter, what's the big surprise?

Peter:
 Lois, you know how I always said you should be treated like a queen? Well, I got you your own jester.

Jester:
 Hey guys, good to be here in New England. And what's the deal with "New" England anyway? It's over 200 years old! Last time I checked, that's not that new.

Peter:
 Ha, this is great. I can finally afford to give my little girl the lips she's always dreamed of.

Meg:
 Thank you, Daddy!

Lois:
 I don't know, Peter. Lips are one thing. But did you have to buy breast implants for Chris?

Peter:
 It makes him happy.

Chris:
 These are cool.

Mailwoman:
 When did you guys get a pool?

Lois:
 Oh, it's a moat. I know it's silly, but my husband thinks our family needs extra protection now that... we're rich.

Mailwoman:
 Does it work?

Lois:
 Well, it does keep the Black Knight at bay.

Mailwoman:
 Well, congratulations in all your success. Here's your welfare check.

Lois:
 What the--

Peter:
 Hi, honey.

Peter:
 Lois, I know what I did was wrong. But I only did it for you and the kids. Except for the jukebox in the bathroom. That was a gift for Peter.

Lois:
 Yeah, from the American taxpayers. I am so mad I can't see straight.

Peter:
 Oh, no problem. We got the money to get that fixed... with enough left over for us to buy our way out of any trouble our kids might get into. Just like the Kennedy's.

Lois:
 You know, I feel like I don't even know you anymore, Peter. The man I marries would never think he could fix a problem just by spending money!

Peter:
 Boy, she's pretty pissed.

Brian:
 Yeah, who would have thought welfare fraud would be one of her buttons?

Peter:
 What's the point in having a jukebox in the john if your wife's mad at you?

Brian:
 Peter, you may have to return that money to the taxpayers.

Peter:
 Yeah, but I gotta make sure Lois knows I'm doing it. I need an event with thousands of people. Something that everybody cares about.

Peter:
 We might have to leave Rhode Island for this one.

John Madden:
 The air is electric here at Super Bowl XXXIII tonight! Pat, I think it's safe to say that all these fans came out here to watch a game of football!

Pat Summerall:
 John, we're in commercial.

John:
 Yeah, I know. I'm just making conversation. Come on. ***waves his hands in Pat's face*** Football!

Peter:
 Oh boy, I hope Lois is watching. Ok, taxpayer, here you go!

Pat:
 Looks like we're getting some rain here tonight, John.

John:
 Yeah. Hey, wait a second! This is no ordinary rain! It's some kind of crazy money rain!

Pat:
 I'm being told it's a man and his dog throwing cash out of a blimp.

Peter:
 Oh, man. I hope this works. Otherwise, I'm gonna have to start dropping these.

John:
 The crowd is storming the field! This is pandemonium! Have you ever seen anything like this, Pat? Pat?

Pat:
 Just once. The 1975 Cotton Bowl. This is the old "trying to make amends for spending $150,000 a week in misappropriated welfare funds" play.

John:
 I don't care what it is! This guy's ruining a perfectly good game of football! Madden to Fox Security.

Fox Security:
 Go ahead.

John:
 Take them down!

Fox Security:
 Yes, sir.

Brian:
 How was your shower?

Peter:
 Oh, I tell you Brian, all of the rumors about dropping the soap are true.

Peter:
 Oh yeah, you can't hold onto that thing to save your life. It was slipping all over the place. Guys were laughing.

Peter:
 Oh boy, I really let Lois down this time. Do you think she'll wait for me?

Brian:
 Oh come one, if every woman dumped her husband just for crashing a blimp into the Super Bowl, no one would be married.

Peter:
 Yeah, you're right. Okay, I got the top bunk.

Meg:
 Oh, the rest of my collagen is wearing off.

Lois:
 Well honey, sagging lips are just nature's way of telling you you shouldn't have covered for your father's lie.

Chris:
 What does it mean when your armpits cry stinky tears?

Lois:
 It means you're becoming a man. But hopefully not the kind who stayed out all day and doesn't call... like your father who shall remain nameless.

Stewie:
 Hello, Mother.

Lois:
 Well hi there, sweetie.

Stewie:
 You know, Mother, life is like a box of chocolates.

Stewie:
 You never know what you're going to get. Your life, however, is more like a box of active grenades!

Stewie:
 Now, I offer you one last chance for deliverance. Return my mind-control device or be destroyed.

Lois:
 Oh, you just want your toy back. Okay, here you go, honey.

Stewie:
 Yes... Well, victory is mine!

Stewie:
 Ah, damn you all!

Lois:
 Hello? Oh, my God!

Peter:
 Lois, ah man, am I glad to see you.

Lois:
 I have nothing to say to you, Peter.

Peter:
 I gave the money back. Why are you still steamed?

Lois:
 Peter, you lied to me, you betrayed my trust. Compared to that, welfare fraud doesn't even matter.

Peter:
 Really? Aw, let's hope the judge feels that way.

Lois:
 Ugh.

Judge:
 This court will come to order.

Peter:
 Well, you know, I figured the sooner I cashed the check, the sooner they'd catch their mistake. Look, why are we making a federal case out of this?

Judge:
 Mr. Griffin, don't you think you should have alerted the government of such a gross overpayment?

Peter:
 Well, I was gonna call them. But my favorite episode of "Different Strokes" was on. You know, the one where Arnold and Dudley get sexually molested by the guy who owns the bike shop?

Bike Shop Owner:
 All right. Now I want you boys to scream real loud at my ass.

Peter:
 And everybody learns a valuable lesson.

Judge:
 Mr. Griffin, have you learned a lesson?

Peter:
 Oh yeah. Stay the hell away from that bike shop.

Peter:
 Okay, everybody, I feel really bad about what I did. I just... I don't know. I just saw one chance I'd ever have to give my family the things they deserve. I guess I screwed it up. I cheated the government. And worst of all, I lied to my wife. And she deserves better. I'm sorry, honey.

Judge:
 Mr. Griffin, I think your words have touched us all. I'm sentencing you to 24 months in prison.

Lois:
 Oh, no!

Brian:
 Oh, no!

Chris:
 Oh, no!

Meg:
 Oh, no!

Kool Aid Man:
 Oh, yeah!

Lois:
 Excuse me, Your Honor?

Judge:
 Yes?

Lois:
 Look, my husband may be a bit thoughtless at times. And he may even be downright stupid. But I know he only accepted that money because he wanted to be a good husband and father. But what he needs to remember is that we love him. And no matter what, I'll always stand by him.

Peter:
 I love you too, honey.

Judge:
 That was very moving Mrs. Griffin. Okay, you can go to jail with him!

Stewie:
 24 months in prison? Unacceptable! Intolerable as it may be, I'm completely dependant upon those wretched drones for sustenance. Let us see how the constitution of American justice fares against against the device!

Judge:
 Is that your boy?

Peter:
 What? Oh uh, yeah. That's Stewie.

Judge:
 Gosh. I can't seperate a kid that young from his father. It's unjudgemently. Aw hell, you've learned your lesson, right?

Judge:
 All right. You're off the hook.

Peter:
 Oh, wow! Can you give me my job back?

Judge:
 No.

Judge:
 Yes.

Peter:
 All right!

Ed:
 That was a crazy one, Dick.

Dick:
 It sure was, Ed. In this next blooper from Joanie Loves Chachi, watch what happens when Scott Baio tries to say: "She sells seashells down by the seashore."

Erin:
 What does your mom do for a living?

Scott:
 She sells seashells down by the--

Peter:
 That is kind of a tongue twister.

Lois:
 It's good to have you home Peter.

Peter:
 Ah, honey, I knew everything would turn out okay.

Meg:
 I sure am gonna miss being rich.

Peter:
 Oh, don't worry. I got a way to get money.

Brian:
 Not another welfare scam?

Peter:
 No, no, no. Minority scholorship.

Lois and Brian:
 No.

Stewie:
 Are you insane?

Peter:
 Okay, I mean, uh, sexual harassment suit.

Lois:
 I don't think so.

Stewie:
 Absolutely outrageous.

Peter:
 Uh, okay, disability claim

Lois:
 Oh, look at Stewie. Isn't he adorable playing with his Sesame Street phone?

Stewie:
 Put me through to the Pentagon.

Ernie:
 Do you know What sound a cow makes?

Stewie:
 Don't toy with me, Ernie! I've already dispatched with Mr. Hooper, I've six armed men outside Big Bird's nest, and as for Linda? It's difficult for a deaf woman to hear an assassin approach, isn't it?

Ernie:
 Can you count to three?

Stewie:
 Indeed I can. One! Two! Three! [Shoots ray-gun] Can I count to three? For God's sake, I'm already shooting at a fifth-grade level.

Lois:
 Come on, Stewie. You can't leave the table until you finish your vegetables.

Stewie:
 Then I shall sit here until one of us expires. And you've got a good 40 years on me, woman!

Lois:
 Sweetie, it's broccoli. It's good for you. Now open up for the airplane. [Makes airplane noise]

Stewie:
 Never! Damn the broccoli! Damn you! And damn the Wright Brothers!

Lois:
 My, aren't we fussy tonight. Okay. No broccoli.

Stewie:
 Very well then. I…[broccoli shoved into mouth] Who the hell do you think you are?

Lois:
 Honey, it's not gonna go away just because you don't like it.

Stewie:
 Well, then. My goal becomes clear. The broccoli must die.

Meg:
 Mom, will you take me out to practice driving?

Lois:
 I'm teaching a piano lesson in half an hour. Maybe your father can take you.

Peter:
 Oh, sorry, Meg. Daddy loves you. But Daddy also loves Star Trek. And, in all fairness, Star Trek was here first.

Captain Kirk:
 Captain's log, Stardate 8169.7. The Enterprise has just discovered a strange new planet in the Gamma Fallopia star system. Mr. Sulu, ahead Warp 9.

Lois:
 For God's sake, Peter. You've been in front of the TV since you got home from work. Why don't you spend some time with your family?

Peter:
 I will, I'm just gonna do it during the commercials. And if that's wrong, well then maybe I'm missing the point of having commercials.

Lois:
 [Sighs]

Meg:
 Please. My road test is tomorrow and you haven't taught me anything.

Brian:
 Meg, you may want to find a better teacher than Peter.

Peter:
 What are you talking about? I'm a great driver.

Brian:
 Remember your trip to the Southwest?

Road Runner:
 Meep-meep!

Peter:
 [Hits Road Runner] Aw, jeez. Did I just hit that ostrich?

 Coyote:
 No.

Peter:
 Are you sure?

 Coyote:
 Yeah, he's fine. Keep going.

Peter:
 Meg, don't believe what they're saying. I always keep my eyes on the road. I don't miss a thing.

Announcer:
 We now return to Star Trek.

Peter:
 Holy crap. Uhura's black?

Peter:
 All right, Meg. Now here's your first lesson. Now, you always want to be aware of other cars on the road. And if you ever catch eyes with the guy next to you at a red light, you gotta race him. Ah, this guy's asking for it.

Meg:
 But Dad...

Peter:
 I don't make the rules, honey. Now rev your engine twice.

Meg:
 Okay.

Peter:
 Go!

Peter:
 Well, you forgot to flip him off. But other than that, nice job.

Lois:
 You're back already? That wasn't much of a lesson.

Peter:
 Well, I didn't want to overload her on her first time out, you know? Besides CHiPs is about to start. So let's sit back and get lost in a world of California Highway Patrol fantasy!

Woman:
 What's the charge, Officer?

Erik Estrada:
 Driving without my phone number.

Erik Estrada:
 Or maybe I should arrest you for being too beautiful. [Teeth sparkling]

Stewie:
 So, broccoli, Mother says you're very good for me. Well, I'm afraid I'm no good for you! The first rule of war is know thine enemy. And I know this! Cold kills broccoli! It's so simple. All I need to do is build a machine to control the global environment. Forecast for tomorrow: a few sprinkles of genius with a chance of doom!

Peter:
 This is taking forever! Come on, Meg, let's go. Fox is running one of those new reality shows at 8:00: "Fast Animals, Slow Children."

Boy:
 Come on, guys. Wait up.

Boy:
 Dang. I got honey all over my legs.

Meg:
 Dad, we can't leave now. My entire life depends on getting my license. If I can't drive, I'll never have any boyfriends, never get married and then I'll have to adopt a kid like Rosie O'Donnell.

Peter:
 Meg, are you implying that Rosie O'Donnell can't drive?

Meg:
 I'm so nervous.

Peter:
 Aw, you're gonna do great. Just remember everything I taught you.

Instructor:
 All right, let's start by going down Main Street.

Instructor:
 What are you doing?

Meg:
 I'm driving. Duh.

Instructor:
 [Screaming]

Meg:
 Are you gonna mark me down for not flipping him off?

Meg:
 Oh, God, my life is over. I am the biggest loser I know!

Peter:
 I know just how you feel, pumpkin. I've had my share of disappointments, too.

OB:
 It's a girl!

Peter:
 Can you check again?

Peter:
 Look, honey, you just have to remember that life has its little ups and...oh, jeez! We're gonna miss the beginning of my show. Hey, there it is.

Meg:
 Dad, watch out!

Peter:
 Meg, honey, are you okay?

Meg:
 Yeah, I think so.

Peter:
 "The Quahog Cable Television Transmitter." Uh-oh.

Man:
 Hey! You just knocked out cable TV for the whole town!

Peter:
 Oh Boy! Hey, look, there's Bigfoot!

Bigfoot:
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. This isn't about me. This is about you.

Peter:
 Oh, well, at least I bought us some time. She did it.

Meg:
 What? Dad, you were the one driving!

Peter:
 I was teaching her to drive and she lost control of the car. Come on, you guys, we all did stupid stuff when we were kids, right? I remember when I tried to sneak into an R-rated movie. <flashback to Peter sneaking into a movie wearing a shrub costume; then back to the regular scene> Aw, come on. Give the kid a break, huh?

Man:
 Why should we?

Peter:
 She got her arm shot off in Vietnam.

Man:
 Poor kid.

Meg:
 I can't believe you just sold out your own daughter.

Peter:
 Now, Meg, honey, I know what I did was wrong, and I know it's not the first time I've embarrassed you.

Teacher:
 And if you add the measure of the angles of a right triangle, the sum of...

Peter:
 Hey, Meg, you mind cleaning out the shower next time you shave your legs? It's like a carpet in there.

Peter:
 I hate to see you so upset. Hey, I know. Let's play a little game called Taking the Fall for Daddy. If you win, I'll buy you a convertible when you get your license.

Meg:
 Really? Oh, Daddy! Now I love you again!

Tom Tucker:
 Because of an accident at the Quahog Cable Company, all television transmission will be out for an undetermined amount of time. Of course, no one can see this news program, so it doesn't really matter what we say. I'm the Lord Jesus Christ. Think I'll go get drunk and beat up some midgets. How about you, Diane?

Diane Simmons:
 Well, Tom, I just plain don't like black people.

Technician:
 You guys, we're still on in Boston.

Stewie:
 Excellent. The weather machine is nearly completed. What do you say to that, broccoli? Stop mocking me! What's this? It appears the witless provider has finally brought me something of value. I can use that crude device to amplify my deadly signal. Victory shall yet be mine.

Meg:
 Guess what, Mom? Dad crashed the car into the city cable transmitter.

Meg:
 Oh, it's okay. If I take the blame, he's going to buy me a convertible when I get my license.

Peter:
 Meg, it's not exactly taking the blame if you go around telling everyone.

Lois:
 Peter! You're bribing your daughter with a car?

Peter:
 Come on, Lois-isn't "bribe" just another word for "love"? Look, you wanted me and Meg to bond. And that's what we're doing.

Chris:
 Dad, I was in a chat room on America Online and Doomie 22 told me some idiot knocked out the cable. We could be without TV for weeks!

Peter:
 Now, now, Chris, now let's not panic. We can manage just fine without TV.

Brian:
 [scoffs]

Peter:
 What's that supposed to mean?

Brian:
 Face it, Peter, you're addicted to television. You're not exactly Mr. Cold Turkey. Remember when you gave up candy?

Willy Wonka:
 I'll ask you one more time. You didn't eat anything in my factory?

Peter:
 No.

Willy Wonka:
 I'm just asking...

Peter:
 Are you calling me a liar?

Willy Wonka:
 I'm just saying...

Peter:
 Hey, shut up, Wonka.

Peter:
 Yeah, well, that was different. I'll be fine.

Lois:
 Are you sure, honey?

Peter:
 Oh, for God's sake, you guys. You think I'm some simp who can't live without TV? C'mon, give me a break.

Peter:
 All right, Mike, what's happening now?

Mike:
 Well, Sipowicz is trying to find out who stabbed the super.

Detective Sipowicz:
 Are you gonna tell me what I want to know, or am I gonna have to show you my ass?

Criminal:
 I ain't saying nothing! All right, it was Jimmy the Hat!

Peter:
 Aw, forget it, Mike. Without actually seeing his ass, this is just radio.

Teacher:
 Well, class, we were scheduled to watch a PBS program on the mating rituals of the nude large-breasted Weewok tribe of New Guinea. Unfortunately, Megan Griffin ruined TV. So, instead, we're having a surprise test.

Meg:
 [Wonder Years Voice] Whoa! Suddenly I was public enemy number one. It was time to tell the truth. [aloud] Wait! I didn't drive into the satellite dish!

Teacher:
 Oh. And who did?

Meg:
 [Wonder Years Voice] I was just a 15-year-old girl. But at that moment, I realized I had a whole lifetime to make new friends. But only one chance to get a new car. And I had to take it. [aloud] Okay, I did it.

Peter:
 Jeez, Brian, I don't know how much longer I can last. It's been a whole week since I seen a TV show. I wonder what Scooby and the gang are up to right now.

Narrator:
 We now return to The Scooby Doo Murder Files.

Fred:
 Gee whiz, gang. Looks like the killer gutted the victim, strangled him with his own intestines and then dumped the body in the river!

Velma:
 Jinkies! What a mystery!

Scooby Doo:
 [Moaning]

Fred:
 You're right, Scoob. We're dealing with one sick son of a bitch.

Brian:
 Well, you just need to find something to fill the void it's left in your life. Lois has her knitting, Chris has his video games, Meg's learning how to drive. And me, I like the sauce. Hey, barkeep, whose leg do you have to hump to get a dry martini around here?

Peter:
 [Moaning] Can't live without TV. Must see TV.

Peter:
 [Sighs]

Lois:
 Stewie, I expect you to finish off your vegetables.

Stewie:
 Oh, rest assured, you relentless harridan, I expect I shall finish them all off! And you as well!

Lois:
 Brian, I'm a little worried about Peter. Last night I woke up and he was channel surfing through static.

Brian:
 Oh, I'm sure he'll find a way to cope.

Peter:
 Morning, Lois.

Brian:
 And you were worried.

Lois:
 Peter, what the hell is that?

Peter:
 It's my favorite TV family, the Griffins.

Lois:
 Peter, you're scaring me. I'm beginning to think you're losing your grip on reality.

Peter:
 Boring. I'm gonna go see what else is on.

Lois:
 Peter! Keep an eye on Stewie.

Brian:
 Don't move!

Stewie:
 [Making ridiculous noises] [Screams] A little help?

Peter:
 Hey! It's Glen Quagmire, the wacky next-door neighbor. What's he up to this time?

Quagmire:
 I'm going to work!

Peter:
 Him and his crazy get-rich-quick schemes.

Lois:
 We have to find your father, Chris. He's not well.

Chris:
 I never knew anyone who went crazy before. Except my invisible friend Col. Schwartz!

Peter:
 I get all the channels on this thing. Lifetime. CBS. Hey, UPN. All right, 90210.

Meg:
 Dad?

Peter:
 Meg, what are you doing at West Beverly? Oh, boy, they're really reaching for guest stars in the 10th season.

Meg:
 Dad, what are you doing? Get out of here! I'm already a total outcast because of you!

Peter:
 Now, honey, you're just upset because you wrecked the cable transmitter.

Meg:
 I did not! Forget it. What good is a car if I have no friends? I didn't wreck TV! My dad did!

Principal:
 What?

Teacher:
 What'd she say?

Groundskeeper:
 Peter Griffin ruined television?

hat:
 And blamed his daughter?

Parachutist:
 Well, that's the lowest thing I've ever heard.

Lois:
 Peter, take that thing off and come home.

Peter:
 Hey, Lois. You're just in time for the exciting conclusion. Looks like some boob's about to get lynched. Let's watch.

Crowd:
 There they are.

hat:
 Hey, that's the guy who ruined our cable. Let's get him!

Lois:
 Stop! Stop! What is wrong with you people? Okay, yes. My husband is responsible for knocking out TV. But we should be thanking him. He's broken television's hypnotic spell over us. Now we can see the world for what it is-a beautiful place full of wonderful things just waiting to be experienced.

Peter:
 Aw, Jeez, another chick flick.

Principal:
 She's right. All the hours we've wasted on that damn idiot box. I'm gonna paint my house!

Parachutist:
 I'm gonna build a ship in a bottle.

Old Man:
 I'm gonna push a hoop with a stick down a dirt road.

Lois:
 I'll take you home, honey.

Peter:
 I can't believe I let Meg take the blame. You were right, Lois. TV is evil. You know, I hear that Manson guy watches it in jail all day long.

Charles Manson:
 If I haven't seen it, it's new to me.

Lois:
 You just went a little overboard. You need a little balance in your life. There are other things to appreciate besides television.

Peter:
 You mean like this lamp?

Lois:
 Yeah. Okay. The lamp gives us light.

Peter:
 I get it.

Lois:
 And your family gives you love. You should spend some time with our kids, Peter. And with me.

Peter:
 What could me and you do together?

Lois:
 [Naughty laugh]

Peter:
 Lois! You've got a sick mind!

Peter:
 Oh. Oh, I thought you wanted us to murder the children and harvest their organs for beer money.

Lois:
 [Amorous giggling]

Peter:
 What a gorgeous day. Isn't it a gorgeous day, Mr. Sun?

Sun:
 It's always a nice day with two scoops of raisins, Peter.

Peter:
 Top of the morning, everybody.

Stewie:
 Excellent! Thus completes the penultimate adjustment to my weather control device! Victory is...release me at once!

Peter:
 Guys, your mother was right. It'd be a crime to just sit around and wait for the TV to start working.

Meg:
 Great. So you can teach me how to drive.

Peter:
 Meg, there'll be plenty of time to drive when you're dead. There's a big world out there just waiting for us to grab it by the short hairs!

Peter:
 Let's go.

Peter:
 I'm so tired. This morning's fly-fishing really wore me out.

Chris:
 Well, wake up! You promised you'd get this hook out of my mouth. [Screams] Thank you.

Lois:
 Now, kids, your father's just trying to spend time with his family. Or kill us. I'm not sure which.

Tom Tucker:
 Those Chinese sure do like to spit, don't they? Well, Diane, that last report was so good, I think you deserve a spanking.

Diane Simmons:
 Oh, Tom, I don't think your wife would appreciate that.

Tom Tucker:
 Diane, that frigid old cow lives in Quahog. She can't hear a word I'm saying.

Technician:
 Actually, we're back on the air in Quahog.

Stewie:
 Thank God! Their puerile minds are once again distracted by that flickering box. Time to be bad!

Peter:
 Come on, everyone. We're late for the Bavarian Folk Festival. You know those Germans. You don't join their party, they'll come get you.

Meg:
 But Dad, the TV's back on.

Peter:
 Huh, what do you know? Okay, let's go.

Lois:
 Peter, I'm thrilled that you want to spend so much time with the family. But we're exhausted. Maybe we could just sit and watch some TV together?

Peter:
 We're too busy living life to the fullest. Come on, let's go.

Lois:
 I'm sick of life.

Brian:
 Yeah. My dogs are barking.

Peter:
 But I thought we were having fun.

Meg:
 We were. But now it might be nice to watch other people have fun or get killed. You know, whatever's on.

Lois:
 Look, Peter. It's your favorite show.

Captain Kirk:
 All right, men. This is a dangerous mission. And it's likely one of us will be killed. The landing party will consist of myself, Mr. Spock, Dr. McCoy, and Ensign Ricky.

Ensign Ricky:
 Ah, crap.

Peter:
 Sorry, Lois. There's only one show I want to see. It's a little something I like to call "Make Every Day Count," starring Peter Griffin as himself.

Lois:
 Oh, come on, Peter. Don't you miss TV just a little? The familiar stories, the broadly drawn characters, the convenient plot turns that bring a character around at exactly the right moment?

William Shatner:
 Hi. I'm William Shatner. My car broke down while I was on my wayto give a speech on how TV keeps families together. Say, would you like to hear it?

Peter:
 No, no, no, I don't want to miss the all-you-can-eat schnitzel bar.

William Shatner:
 Wait a minute! I love schnitzel!

Peter:
 Oh, well, come along. I bet you could squeeze into Lois' lederhosen.

William Shatner:
 I'll change in the car.

Meg:
 If I had a nickel for every time one of my parents walked out on meinstead of teaching me how to drive, I'd be one rich little...

Lois:
 Let's go, Meg.

Stewie:
 Fare thee well, broccoli!

William Shatner:
 I don't know. I can't imagine choosing life over television.

Peter:
 I'm telling you, it's great, Bill. The only thing that would make this perfect day better is if my family was here.

William Shatner:
 My God! It was sunny a moment ago, but now it's pouring!

Peter:
 Hey, let's take off our shoes and run home barefoot!

William Shatner:
 Griffin, you're a madman! Barefoot, you say?

Lois:
 This is not safe. I'll teach you how to drive some other time. Pull over.

Meg:
 Mom, I can't even tell where "over" is.

William Shatner:
 [Giddy laughter] You were right, Peter. I've never felt so alive.

Stewie:
 Victory is mine! [screams] God damn it.

William Shatner:
 [Giddy laughter] My God.

Meg:
 Oh, my God. I hit William Shatner.

William Shatner:
 Light growing dimmer. Can't breathe. Beam me up, God.

Ensign Ricky:
 I did not see that coming.

Meg:
 Daddy, I'm sorry I ran you over and killed Mr. Shatner.

Peter:
 Ah, don't worry, honey. Soon as I get out of this body cast, I'm gonna do enough living for me and Bill.

Lois:
 Honey, can't we go back to the way things used to be? There's a big dent in that couch that nobody else can fill.

Peter:
 Haven't you guys learned anything? TV took over my life once. I'm never gonna let that happen again.

Lois:
 Oh, my God. We've lost him.

Peter:
 Hey, if you help me out of here, I know an enchanted meadow where the blueberries are just begging to be picked.

Nurse:
 Look, buddy. Just go in the pan, and don't call me unless you're flatlining.

Peter:
 Hey. Hey, turn that TV off. Nurse? Nurse?

Announcer:
 What would you do for a Klondike Bar? Would you stand on one leg?

Man:
 Sure.

Announcer:
 Would you act like a monkey?

Man:
 Uh-huh. [makes monkey noises]

Announcer:
 Would you-would you kill a man?

Man:
 Uh. Uh, well...

Meg:
 Daddy, now that I've finally passed my driver's test, can I still get a convertible?

Peter:
 No. But I'm proud of you for getting your license, sweetheart.

Lois:
 And I'm proud of you, Peter. You taught us all a valuable lesson. It's not what you do that defines the quality of your life, it's who you do it with And your family...

Peter:
 Shhh...It's on.

Lois:
 I know you don't like broccoli, Stewie, but you'll thank me when you grow up big and strong like your

Stewie:
 A compelling argument. You've swayed me, woman. Mmmm. Oooh, that is good. I feel stronger already. It's good tasting and good for you.

Stewie:
 Nice try.

Brian:
 Quadruped.

Stewie:
 Mutant.

Lois:
 Well, everything's all set for Stewie's birthday party. I can't believe he's almost a year old.

Peter:
 Yeah. I'll never forget the day he was born.

Doctor:
 One more push, Lois. This is quite a miracle, Mr. Griffin. Would you like to have a look?

Peter:
 Yeah, you know, I've never actually seen a live baby being...oh, God!

Doctor:
 Congratulations, Mrs. Griffin. It's a boy. Wait a minute. I don't think we're through here.

Lois:
 Oh, my God! Is it twins?

Doctor:
 No. It's a map of Europe.

Lois:
 I just confirmed everything with the birthday party planner down at Cheesie Charlie's.

Peter:
 Why Cheesie Charlie's?

Chris:
 Ah, it's cool, Dad! They have this game where you put in a dollar and you win four quarters! I win every time! I get to go, right?

Peter:
 Why can't we have the same kind of party we always do?

Lois:
 Peter, this could be our last first birthday ever. YOu know, when Meg and Chris turned one, I had so much to do, I missed everything.

Peter:
 Lois, you're not gonna believe this! Meg just said "Da-Da!"

Lois:
 Her first words?

Peter:
 Then she stood up all by herself and started walking!

Lois:
 Her first steps?

Peter:
 Yeah. What the hell are you doing in here anyway?

Peter:
 All right! Her first drum solo.

Lois:
 Well, thanks to Cheesie Charlie I'm not gonna miss a moment of Stewie's party.

Stewie:
 I say, am I to spend the entire day wallowing around in my own feces? <clap clap> A little service here!

Peter:
 Hey, Stinky. Have we got some big plans for you.

Stewie:
 Plans? What the devil are you talking about?

Chris:
 It's your birthday, dude.

Lois:
 Saturday's gonna be real special, honey. I've hired a professional to make sure everything goes just right.

Stewie:
 A professional? <gasp> There's treachery afoot!

Meg:
 [Crying]

Peter:
 Meg, you're home late.

Meg:
 I stayed after school to try out for cheerleading.

Peter:
 Well, don't keep me in suspense. How'd you do?

Meg:
 I'll give you a hint. I S-U-C-K-E-D! Sucked! Sucked!

Peter:
 Yay! Oh, I mean, sorry, honey.

Meg:
 God, I hate high school. I don't fit in with anyone.

Peter:
 Oh, boy. Do I know that feeling.

Dancer:
 Okay, man. Okay. You are really throwing me off. It's step-kick, step-twirl. Got it?

Peter:
 I thought we were just gonna rumble with those greasy Sharks.

Dancer:
 Not without seven years of ballet and two of jazz tap, we're not. From the top, people! Look, why don't you just hang back and stretch?

Meg:
 I don't get it. The harder I try to make friends, the more people hate me.

Peter:
 Listen. Meg, you're a one-of-a-kind girl with a mind of her own. Now, see, that's what people hate.

Meg:
 Really?

Peter:
 I'm telling you, just be the girl you think everyone else wants you to be.

Meg:
 Wow, it's so obvious. Thanks, Daddy. Hi, Mom. Bye, Mom.

Lois:
 Well, I haven't seen Meg this happy since that bus broke down in front of our house.

Taylor Hanson:
 Hi. Can we use your phone?

Peter:
 Holy crap! It's The Children of the Corn!

Peter:
 Meg and I just had a little father-daughter talk.

Lois:
 Well, it seems to have worked.

Peter:
 Hey, I wasn't just blowing smoke when I bought this T-shirt ("#1 Dad").

Lois:
 Well, you're the number-one husband, too.

Peter:
 I know. That's why I bought this T-shirt ("No Fat Chicks"). Whoops.

Stewie:
 <writing in diary> "Dear Diary, It seems the domestic overseers are plotting against me. Their plans somehow relate to the anniversary of my escape from the womb. I'm still haunted by the memories of how I came to be incarcerated in that amniotic Attica.

Stewie:
 "As I recall, it was every potential man for himself.

Stewie:
 "I alone had reached the target objective, thanks to the peerless intrepidity I developed at testicular boot camp. But it was a trap! I was imprisoned in that uterine gulag for nine grueling months."

Stewie:
 Day 171. I've sprouted another finger. Counting the one from yesterday, I'm up to 11.

Stewie:
 "As the months of solitude passed, I began to go insane. It seemed my prison cell was getting smaller and smaller. I was quite sure that soon I would be dead. But then, a miracle! There was a light at the end of the tunnel. I rushed to freedom, but suddenly I was ambushed by a mysterious man in white!" <aloud> The man in white. Of course! He must be the hired professional of whom they spoke. He failed to thwart my escape into the outside world. And now, one year hence, he's returning to rectify his mistake and-put me back in the womb!

Meg:
 Hey, I love throwing up.

Girls:
 [Laughing]

Meg:
 [Sighs]

Jennifer:
 Hi. I'm Jennifer.

Meg:
 I'm Meg.

Jennifer:
 Oh, my God. Your hair is so beautiful. I just want to brush it.

Meg:
 Really? You want to go throw up?

Chris:
 Hey, Dad, let's go whack some moles!

Peter:
 Now, Chris, we're not here for fun.

Peter:
 Your mom is counting on us to drop off the deposit. So let's just deliver the check and uh...Hong Kong Phooey!

Chris:
 Yeah! Come on! Go, yeah! Eat my dust!

Peter:
 Come on, move it! Oh, man! Chris, this place is great. Hye, pull over, you bastard! Oh, man.

Chris:
 Hey, Dad, they even got games in the bathroom. Look, I won a balloon!

Peter:
 Oh, way to go, Chris. Where's my watch?

Boy:
 All right. I won a watch. What's The Dukes of Hazzard?

Peter:
 Hey, that's mine. Hey, come on. Come on, give that back!

Boy:
 Give it!

Peter:
 Come on!

Uncle Jesse:
 Folks in Hazzard County hadn't seen a watch fight in a good long time. Them boys rassled for a

Peter:
 Come on! Come on! Come on!

Boy:
 Hands off, fatty!

Employee:
 Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

Peter:
 Hey, I'm a paying customer. Look, I got a deposit check for my kid's birthday party right here.

Employee:
 Ooh, Mr. Griffin. I am terribly sorry. We're really looking forward to Stewie's special day.

Peter:
 Well, now I don't know. After the emotional trauma I've endured on your premises, I think I deserve a little discount.

Employee:
 Sir, our prices are set by the corporate office.

Peter:
 Well then, maybe I'll just take my business elsewhere. Good luck filling our spot by this Saturday.

Man:
 I got cash!

Woman:
 I'll take it!

Employee:
 Suit yourself.

Peter:
 Wait. Wait, I was just bluffing. My wife has her heart set on this place. [yells after him] Chris, this is a big day for you. The day you become the man of the house. Because when we get home, your mother is going to kill me.

Stewie:
 So the man in white is coming to put me back in the womb, is he? If I'm to defeat him, I shall require professional forces. Here we are. "Come to Managua, the Mecca of mercenaries." I must prepare for my journey. Let's see. Grenades, mace, baggy full of Cheerios...

Lois:
 So, are we all set at Cheesie Charlie's?

Peter:
 Well, actually, I canceled the reservation.

Lois:
 What? Peter, how could you?

Peter:
 Lois, I got a very good reason.

Brian:
 Wait a second. These are always classic.

Peter:
 Lois, that Cheesie Charlie's is no good. See, it happened like this.

Employee:
 Welcome to Cheesie Charlie's. Heil, Hitler!

Peter:
 Actually, the name's Griffin. I was sent by my smart, beautiful, and still sexually appealing wife, Lois.

Employee:
 Ah, yes. We're all set for your little boy's party.

Peter:
 I understand we're getting a terrific bargain here.

Employee:
 Oh, absolutely. The children get to play our games. And if they win enough tickets, they get a prize.

Boy:
 I have 13 tickets now. Is that enough?

Boy:
 [Screaming]

Employee:
 They also get food, cake, and your choice of ice-cream flavors: vanilla, strawberry, chocolate, or people.

Peter:
 What was that last one?

Employee:
 Chocolate. Give me the check.

Peter:
 Hold it!, pal Lois may have had her heart set on this place, but I love my family too much to risk their

Employee:
 Oh, no, you're not!

Peter:
 Oh, please don't make me angry, pal. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.

Lois:
 All right, Peter. That's enough!

Brian:
 Bravo, Peter. You are the Spalding Gray of crap.

Lois:
 Peter, do you know how hard it was to get a reservation at Cheesie Charlie's? I had to book it the day of my ultrasound. We'll never find another place in time! For once, it was all gonna be so perfect!

Peter:
 Come on, Lois. It'll still be perfect. We'll give him the best birthday ever right here in the safety and comfort of our own home.

Lois:
 Peter, we've been over this.

Peter:
 Honey, you won't have to lift a finger. I got us a clown, a cake, a petting zoo, a big-ass piÃ±ata, the works!

Lois:
 You got all those things?

Peter:
 You bet I did.

Lois:
 Wow. Even Cheesie Charlie's doesn't have a petting zoo. Okay, I'll call the parents and let them know the party's here.

Brian:
 You don't have any of those things.

Peter:
 How do you know?

Brian:
 Peter, face it. You're a terrible liar.

Man:
 [Sniffing]

Peter:
 Uh, it was you.

Brian:
 YOu know, clowns and petting zoos book months in advance. You're gonna have a tough time finding a...hold on.

Driver:
 Ya! Ya!

Brian:
 Some day.

Ticket agent:
 Well, hey there, little boy. Are you lost?

Stewie:
 Now, listen to me..."Jolene." I've got an army to raise, and I must get to Nicaragua. I require a window seat and an in-flight Happy Meal. And no pickles! Oh, God help you if I find pickles.

Ticket agent:
 Henry, I have a lost little boy.

Henry:
 Well, hey there, little fella. Why don't you come with me?

Stewie:
 No, damn you! You're one of them, aren't you? What are they paying you? I'll double it! I'll give you whatever you want! Money! Women! Men?

Chris:
 Uh, Dad, what are we doing here again?

Peter:
 Pigs, Chris. We're getting pigs for Stewie's petting zoo.

Peter:
 Crafty swine. "UPS!" Little bastards ain't as smart as...

Meg:
 Hi, Mom. This is Jennifer. She gave me a ride home.

Lois:
 Meg, you made a friend.

Jennifer:
 What a lovely house, Mrs. G. Meg, you didn't tell me your mother was just like Martha Stewart.

Lois:
 Oh, no. Once you get to know me, I'm really very nice.

Jennifer:
 You know what's nice? Having a friend like Meg. And kittens. It was super swell meeting you. Bye, Meg. Friends forever.

Meg:
 Forever and ever.

Jennifer:
 Wow! What a great yard!

Meg:
 Guess what, Mom? Jennifer invited me to a party on Saturday.

Lois:
 This Saturday? Meg, you can't miss Stewie's first birthday.

Meg:
 But Mom...

Lois:
 Meg, our entire family is going to be here for Stewie's party. And that includes you. Understood?

Meg:
 I can't believe you'd put your family before your own daughter!

Brian:
 She's a whiny little runt, isn't she?

Lois:
 [gasp]

Brian:
 I said "runt."

Peter:
 I don't think I'm in the right place. I'm looking for a guy to entertain the kids at my son's birthday.

Man:
 Sure. I can do that.

Peter:
 You do children's parties?

Man:
 Yeah. I can do, like, a handstand, and some somersaults maybe. I can make pretend like the children are little bugs in my web.

Henry:
 Do you know your phone number, son?

Stewie:
 The only way you'll get me to talk is through slow, painful torture. And I don't think you've got the grapes!

Henry:
 Oh, sounds like you don't want to go home. Are you running away?

Stewie:
 Stewart Gilligan Griffin runs from nothing!

Henry:
 You know, son, running away never solves anything. You're getting to be a big boy now. And part of growing up means facing your problems head on.

Stewie:
 Hmmm. The ruptured capillaries in your nose belie the clarity of your wisdom. You're saying I must return to face this man in white myself. So be it. As for you, kind sage, I only hope my heartfelt thanks will keep you warm as you spend the next 10 years in frozen carbonite!

Brian:
 well, Peter, you've only got a couple of hours left. If you pull a party out of your ass, you might want to stand up.

Meg:
 Dad, my friend Jennifer invited me to hang out with a bunch of her friends. Can I go?

Peter:
 Oh no, I'm not fallin' for this trick. Did you ask your mother?

Meg:
 Yes.

Peter:
 Okay, then. Have fun, sweetheart.

Meg:
 Thanks, Daddy!

Peter:
 Brian, Stewie's birthday is gonna suck. The only stuff I could get on such short notice was a cake and that big-ass piÃ±ata.

Brian:
 I sure hope candy comes out of that.

Peter:
 Face it, Brian. I'm a bad father, a lousy husband, and a snappy dresser. I'll never be able to face Lois.

Brian:
 Well, the circus is in town. Maybe you could run away and join it.

Peter:
 The circus!

Neighbor:
 Hi. This is the right day, isn't it?

Lois:
 Oh, yes. Peter should be back any minute and then we can start the party, I hope.

Peter:
 Hey, Lois, look. The two symbols of the Republican party: an elephant and a big fat white guy who's threatened by change.

Lois:
 Oh, Peter, this is the most wonderful celebration I could have imagined.

Peter:
 Yeah. Where's Stewie?

Lois:
 He's upstairs, resting up for his big day.

Lois:
 I'll get him. If you see Meg, tell her to take plenty of pictures.

Peter:
 Meg's not here. She went to a friend's house.

Lois:
 What? She's gonna miss Stewie's birthday.

Peter:
 Yeah, I dropped her off an hour ago. Boy, is she gonna be sorry, or what?

Lois:
 Oh, Peter. How could you let her go?

Peter:
 Jeez, what's the big deal? So Meg's with her new friends. They seemed like some nice kids.

Jennifer:
 I'm glad you could join us, Meg. We're gonna have a great time on our trip.

Meg:
 A trip? Like to the beach? 'Cause I didn't bring my bathing suit.

Jennifer:
 Oh, you won't need anything where we're going. Excuse me. I've gotta go mix the punch.

Chris:
 Hey, birthday dude! You want some ice cream?

Stewie:
 Yes. But no sprinkles! For every sprinkle I find, I shall kill you!

Peter:
 Oh, come on, Lois. I hate to see you so upset. Look, we got animals, we got clowns. I mean, a party couldn't be any better if Jesus himself showed up.

Jesus:
 Okay, everybody. For my next miracle, I'm gonna turn water into funk.

Lois:
 Peter, the circus is terrific. But it's not just Stewie's birthday. We're also celebrating the day our family became whole. Today means nothing if Meg isn't here.

Jennifer:
 Meg, you seem sad. Today's a happy day.

Meg:
 I know. It's just that...I really like that guy over there. But he doesn't even know I exist. He must think I'm a total dog.

Jennifer:
 Oh, that is so not true.

Meg:
 Then what is it?

Jennifer:
 He's a eunuch.

Jennifer:
 Sure. All the guys here have been castrated. It's cool.

Brian:
 Hey, you. Hit me. There, now, if I can just find a midget with some gin, I'll be in business. Where are you off to?

Peter:
 I gotta make things right for Lois and get this monkey off my back. Ow! Knock it off! Hey! Hey!

Stewie:
 All right, men, the man in white is coming to put me back in the womb. Today he comes for me, but tomorrow it could be you or you! I offer you the opportunity to join me in glorious battle. I know there are some amongst you whose motor skills are not developed. Sadly, you will be used as decoys. But your children's children will know that you fell for a noble cause. Now, who's with me?

Boy:
 Duckie?

Stewie:
 Useless, every one of you! Fine. I'll defend myself, and the hell with all of you! Ah! There, I've gone and soiled myself. Are you happy now?

Jennifer:
 Ooh! Our leader is here to take us on our journey!

Cult leader:
 My children, rejoice. The hour of transformation is close at hand. Who are you?

Jennifer:
 This is Meg, o wise one. Can she come with us?

Cult leader:
 Perhaps. Do you have a mind that seeks enlightenment and a heart that seeks purity?

Meg:
 Well, not really.

Cult leader:
 Okay. Are you a confused adolescent desperately seeking acceptance from an undifferentiated ego mass that demands conformity?

Meg:
 Wow, that sort of sounds more like me.

Cult leader:
 Great! Well, then all you need is a dark-blue jogging suit. Let's see what we have in stock. What are you? About a 9?

Meg:
 No. A 6.

Cult leader:
 ...Right. Dispense the refreshments.

Peter:
 Oh, Meg, there you are.

Meg:
 Dad, what are you doing here? Oh, I'm so embarrassed, I could die!

Boy:
 Hey, hey, not before the rest of us!

Peter:
 Meg, your mother wants the family together today.

Meg:
 It's just Stewie's birthday. So what if I'm not there? Who's gonna remember?

Peter:
 Your mom will, trust me. She remembers everything. In fact, she always says the best memories she has are when you kids were born. Aw, jeez, Meg, that's it. This day is more for your mom than it is for Stewie. With all she's given us, she oughta get whatever she wants. And, Meg, today she wants you to be with the family.

Meg:
 Really? Oh, Daddy, you must think I'm the worst daughter ever.

Peter:
 Oh, no you're not, honey. What about that fat girl from the Judds?

Meg:
 I'm sorry I've been so selfish.

Peter:
 Sure. The more the merrier.

Jennifer:
 Meg, you have the coolest family.

Peter:
 She sure does. Hey-here's to family!

All:
 To family!

Peter:
 Jeez, look at the time! Come on. Come on, kids, let's get going.

Peter:
 Aw, sorry, Meg. I guess it's another bunch of people that'd rather fake death than go to a party with you.

Cult leader:
 Children, the time of ascension has arrived. Oh, for the love of God. Haven't any of you ever been in a cult before? Damn it! I can't achieve transcendence by myself. That would just make me some kind of lone nut. Somebody's got to die with me. Come back, Meg! Whoops. Can't forget my ceremonial white robe.

Lois:
 Well, I guess there's nothing left but the birthday cake.

Meg:
 Right here!

Lois:
 Meg!

Meg:
 I'm sorry, Mom.

Lois:
 Oh, thank you, Peter.

Peter:
 No problem. I cannot wait to taste this cake. The guy who sold it to me said it was delicious and erotic.

Lois:
 Peter, there's a naked man on this cake.

Peter:
 Well, there were only two left. And trust me, you did not want the one of Al Roker with the Hershey Kiss nipples.

Lois:
 Well, gather round, everyone. It's time for Stewie's big moment.

Cult leader:
 Hello? Is anybody home?

Stewie:
 Greetings, man in white. I've been expecting you.

Cult leader:
 Who said that?

Stewie:
 Peek-a-boo! I see you! You're getting warmer.

Cult leader:
 Where are you? What do you want?

Stewie:
 Freedom! What do you want?

Cult leader:
 I want to get the hell out of here!

Stewie:
 Oh, I'm sorry. We're fresh out of that. I'm afraid all that's left is untimely death.

Cult leader:
 What the hell is this?

Stewie:
 It's a boy!

Lois:
 Hey, has anybody seen Stewie?

Meg:
 Yeah. Where is the birthday boy?

Lois:
 Yes. And this cake is yours, too.

Chris:
 Hey, Stewie, make a wish. If you blow out the candle, it'll come true.

Peter:
 That's right, little buddy. What do you want most in the whole world?

Stewie:
 In the whole world, you say?

Stewie:
 Oh, what the hell.

Singer:
 ? When life is getting to you, put some fresh in your life? ?Let Mintos freshen up your life? ?Life is just a breeze when you stay fresh and cool? ?Because Mintos puts the fresh in life ?

Singers:
 ? Taste that freshness, just can't beat it? ?Mintos freshness, let Mintos freshen your life! ?

Announcer:
 Mintos, the Freshmaker.

Meg:
 These commercials are stupid.

Lois:
 They certainly don't make me want a Minto.

Brian:
 Totally ineffective.

Peter:
 Must kill Lincoln.

Lois:
 [playing classical music on piano]

Peter:
 [blows kiss]

Lois:
 Ow!

Stewie:
 Blast you, woman! Awake from your damnable reverie!

Lois:
 Honey, I'm doing the dishes.

Stewie:
 Oh, well, a thousand pardons for disrupting your flatware sanitation ritual. But you see, I'm in searing

Lois:
 Oh, you're just teething, Stewie. It's a normal part of a baby's life.

Stewie:
 Very well then, I order you to kill me at once!

Lois:
 Oh, honey, I know you're hurting. But Mommy has to clean up the house, all right?

Stewie:
 No, it's not all right! For the love of God, shake me! Shake me like a British nanny!

Lois:
 [sighs]

Peter:
 Oh, man, this is the life. Hey, hand me another one of them Pawtucket Patriots. Guys, guys, I want to say

Brian:
 Brian.

Peter:
 Yeah. Yeah! If you guys were beers, I would drink every one of you. And I wish you were 'cause we're out.

Cleveland:
: [Giggling] Oh, that's funny. That's even more humorous than that joke you told us last night.

Peter:
 Okay, so a Jewish guy and a Chinese guy walk into a bar, right? Oh, wait, wait a second. Okay, Jewish guy

Priest:
 No, I've heard them all.

Cleveland:
 Oh, look at the time. I promised Loretta I was gonna trim the hedges and be tender with her.

Peter:
 Believe me, Cleveland. Our wives need some time off as much as we do. This is when Lois does all those

Lois:
 [Grunting]

Brian:
 I'll be on your bed. No calls.

Peter:
 Hey, Lois. Look, I know you've been busy all day, so I took care of dinner.

Lois:
 Really?

Peter:
 All you gotta do is gut it, clean it, scale it, and cook it. [kiss]

Lois:
 Peter, I spent all morning cleaning up the house. And in five seconds, you turn it into low tide at the

Peter:
 Aw, jeez. I'm sorry, honey. I'd help you clean it up. But you know how lousy I am with housework.

Peter:
 Now, let's see. Shirts, pants...her, I'm missing another sock. Hey!

 Tumnus:
 Welcome to Narnia. I'm Mr. Tumnus.

Peter:
 Hey, give me back my sock, you goat bastard! Hey!

Lois:
 You're right. It's better if I do it.

Stewie:
 Damn it to the bowels of bloody hell!

Lois:
 Well, the baby's up. Can you get him?

Peter:
 Okay. I hope he doesn't need changing. I'm a little gun-shy after what happened last time.

Stewie:
 No, no, no, you imbecile! That's not talc! That's paprika! Ah! Take that!

Lois:
 All right, I'll do that, too! Can you at least take Chris to his game?

Peter:
 Aw, jeez, Lois. I spent all morning on a boat with my friends, drinking beer, telling jokes, and screwing

Lois:
 Honey, I'm begging you. Just drop Chris off at his soccer game and come right home. I need you to look

Peter:
 All right, all right! You know I spoil you.

Chris:
 Thanks for the ride, Dad.

Peter:
 All right. Have fun, Chris.

Quagmire:
 Hey, Peter!

Peter:
 Quagmire? What are you doing here?

Quagmire:
 Oh, you know. Soccer moms!

Quagmire:
 All right.

Peter:
 I'd like to hang around with you. But Lois needs me at home.

Quagmire:
 I got beer.

Peter:
 Boo, Lois! Yay, beer!

Lois:
 [shushing] It's okay, Stewie. Where the hell's Peter? That was good, Reuben. Now play...Brahms' Lullaby.

Stewie:
 Oh, enough! The only thing worse than the wretched pain in my mouth is the excrement spewing from yours!

Lois:
 Oh, I wish I could make the pain go away sooner. But I can't turn time forward.

Stewie:
 Oh, no? Perhaps I can! Of course! I'll simply build a machine that can move time! I shall call it a time

Peter:
 Go, Chris! Daddy loves you! I-I mean in a platonic way. I'm married.

Referee:
 [whistle] Hand ball! Penalty kick, blue!

Mother:
 That's the 10th time today! Nice grab, orca. Hey, get Moby Dick off the field before he burps up a

Peter:
 Hey, hey, hey. Easy, fella. That's my kid. Now apologize.

Mother:
 Okay. I'm sorry your kid's a brain-dead stinking blue cheese feta!

Peter:
 Oh, oh, that's it!

Chris:
 Way to go, Dad!

Boy:
 You hit my mom!

Peter:
 No, I hit your dad.

Man:
 Whoa, stand back. Give her some air.

Peter:
 You mean, "Give him some air."

Woman:
 Call an ambulance. She's going into labor.

Peter:
 You mean, "He's going into labor."

Peter:
 I can't believe I punched a woman.

Brian:
 A pregnant woman.

Peter:
 I just hope she accepts my peace offering. I sent her a little something for the baby.

Peter:
 Course, I would've brought it over myself if I wasn't under house arrest.

Brian:
 Well, you're just fortunate this is your first offense, Peter.

Peter:
 No kidding. Could've been a lot worse if the cops knew about those other times I broke the law.

Peter:
 And there was that time I took a whiz in public.

Peter:
 And that time I snuck into Wimbledon.

Quagmire:
 Well, me and Cleveland are gonna "amscray."

Peter:
 Wait, wait, wait. You guys can't leave me here alone.

Quagmire:
 Why don't you come with us?

Peter:
 I can't leave the premises. They're monitoring my every move.

Peter:
 I gotta get out of here! I gotta get out of here! I gotta get out of here!

Lois:
 There's my little house husband. It's been so wonderful having you home all week.

Peter:
 Oh, thanks, honey. But, honestly, I don't know how you stand being in the house all day. I mean, I'm so

Bert:
 [on phone] Hello? Son of a bitch. I'm on my way. [off phone] Some poor bastard got his head blown off

Ernie:
 Bert, I wish you wouldn't drink so much, Bert.

Bert:
 Well, Ernie, I wish you wouldn't eat cookies in the damn bed!

Ernie:
 Bert, you're shouting again, Bert!

Peter:
 I know you can't understand what I'm going through, Lois. I mean, all the stuff that makes you happy,

Brian:
 Ah-ah. Stop. Now.

Lois:
 Peter, I don't do those things because I enjoy them. I do them because I love my family.

Peter:
 [giggling] Lois loves her family. Lois loves her family. ?Lois and the family sitting in a tree? See,

Lois:
 Why don't I go buy some groceries and make us a nice romantic dinner? Like when we were dating. That

Peter:
 It already has. [pause] I wonder what the guys are up to?

Cleveland:
 Oh, that's nasty.

Peter:
 Where's the damn pull string? [yells] You never know what you're gonna find down here.

Peter:
 Ah!

Pawtucket Patriot:
 Peter!

Peter:
 Hey, hey you're the Pawtucket Patriot.

Pawtucket Patriot:
 Verily. Come hither and give heed.

Peter:
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't swing that way, pal. Look, I got a date with my female wife. I just came

Pawtucket Patriot:
 Why spend time with your wife? If you build a bar in this basement and stock it with

Peter:
 Build a bar! That's a great idea. Wait, one last question. If I walk through you, does that mean, like,

Pawtucket Patriot:
 Jeez. What's with you and the gay jokes?

Peter:
 [Snoring]

Lois:
 Peter, where the hell have you been? We had a date.

Peter:
 Aw, sorry, honey. I must've lost track of the time. What do you say, eh? You think the guys will like it?

Lois:
 This is why you missed our dinner? To make a bar for your friends?

Peter:
 Yeah, isn't it great? Oh, boy, I feel just like Tim Allen. I build stuff and I have a criminal record.

Peter:
 Okay, okay, guys. I got another one. What's the difference between pornography and art?

Quagmire:
 [Chuckling] Here it comes.

Peter:
 A government grant.

Cleveland:
 Peter, you are in the zone.

Peter:
 Hey, honey, you know those little clam cakes you always make whenever we have company? I need about a

Lois:
 That's it, Peter! I'm not a servant. And I'm through taking care of you and your bar buddies!

Peter:
 Jeez. Where the hell did that come from?

Lois:
 Watch the kids. I'm taking a hot bath.

Stewie:
 Put me down, you Brobdingnagian blunderbuss!

Meg:
 He's a little cranky from teething.

Peter:
 I can fix that.

Stewie:
 [Mumbling] Good God, man! One can only imagine what foul regions that finger has erstwhile probed!

Peter:
 There you go. My mother used to use whiskey whenever I had a toothache.

Peter:
 My tooth hurts!

Peter:
 There. How's that feel?

Stewie:
 Well, it's-it's delightful.

Lois:
 Thank you. Thank you very much.

Peter:
 Lois, you are a wonderful woman. Words cannot express the depth of my appreciation and love for you.

Lois:
 Oh, Peter!

Lois:
 Aaah!

Man:
 Hey, you must be Lois.

Stewie:
 No, not silicone. Silicon. And the design of the device is quite ingenious if I do say so myself, Misty.

Girl:
 I have a Barney pen in my purse.

Stewie:
 You are spectacular!

Lois:
 Chris, what are you doing here?

Chris:
 Sorry, Mom. I'm gonna need to see some ID.

Lois:
 Chris, go to your room!

Stewie:
 Hello, Mother. Care to partake in one of your oh-so-exhilarating games of peekaboo?

Lois:
 Oh, my God! My baby is drunk!

Peter:
 No, I'm not! Oh, him? Oh, yeah, yeah. He's a real lightweight.

Lois:
 Meg, take Stewie upstairs.

Stewie:
 ?Show me the way to go home? Everybody! ?I'm tired and I want to go to bed? Just the women!

Lois:
 Peter, in the 17 years that we've been married I have never been as angry as I...what is my piano doing

Peter:
 Well, it was supposed to be a clam cake buffet, but...never mind.

Lois:
 That does it, Peter. Either this bar goes or I do!

Peter:
 Lois, honey, I haven't even told you the other reason your piano's down here. I wanted you to play it.

Men:
 Yeah. Yeah. Come on!

Lois:
 Oh, no, no, I couldn't.

Man:
 Come on!

Lois:
 Maybe one song.

Peter:
 Pretend you like it no matter how bad it stinks.

Lois:
 [Lois chuckles]

Lois:
 ? You'll never know just how much I love you? ?"You'll never know just how much I care?

Man:
 Yeah!

Lois:
 ? And if I try, I still couldn't hide my love for you? ?You oughta know for haven't I told you so? ?

Peter:
 Okay, guys. Thank you. You can stop pretending now.

Guy:
 All right!

Lois:
 ? If there is some other way to prove that I love you? ?I swear I don't know how ?

Man:
 Sing it, baby.

Brian:
 Something troubling you, Peter?

Peter:
 Oh, no, nothing. Just all my friends are eye-humping my wife.

Lois:
 ? You'll never know if you don't know now ?

Guys:
 Wonderful! Wow!

Lois:
 It was absolutely amazing. The second that spotlight hit me, I became a whole different person!

Stewie:
 Silence, you contemptible shrew!

Lois:
 Aw, I bet your gums are still sore.

Stewie:
 Oh, you're so observant, aren't you? Are you a detective? Yes, my gums are sore! Enough of this! I must

Chris:
 Hey, Dad! Mom says she was really on last night.

Peter:
 Oh, yeah. About that. Lois, see, the guys were just being polite. They thought your singing was too...

Lois:
 I was just nervous. Tonight'll be better.

Peter:
 Tonight? Honey, I don't think anyone's gonna come back tonight.

Lois:
 ? Gimme, gimme, gimme what I cry for? ?You know you got the brand of kisses that I die for ?

Cleveland:
 Oh, this one takes me back.

Quagmire:
 Now that's a woman! That's a house. That's a fish. That's a bee!

Lois:
 ? You know you made me love you ? I love you! Thank you. Thank you. Johnny Muldoon, ladies and gentlemen.

Lois:
 You know, I was born in a little town called Quahog.

Man:
 We love you, Lois!

Lois:
 [laughs] Let me finish the story, fellas. You don't want to be up all night. Or do you?

Peter:
 "Or do you?"

Man:
 She's a smokin' little pistol, isn't she?

Peter:
 Are you a woman?

Man:
 No.

Peter:
 My house arrest is over, Brian. Round up the guys. Now that I'm a free man, we can do anything we want.

Brian:
 Uh, the guys only want to do one thing, and that's ogle your wife. I tell you, if Lois were my woman, I'd

Man:
 Wow, Lois Griffin! Hey, I love your act. Nice melons.

Peter:
 Hey, listen, pal...

Lois:
 Peter, I'm holding melons.

Man:
 And her hooters ain't bad either!

Peter:
 Now hang on a second there!

Lois:
 Peter, I'm holding hooters.

Man:
 No problem. Your wife's hot!

Peter:
 All right, that's it! Lois, your singing days are over. For God's sake, if I wanted to marry Lola Falana,

Peter:
 Look, Lola. This whole thing's just going way too fast for me.

Leslie Uggams:
 For the last time, I'm not Lola! I'm Leslie Uggams!

Lois:
 Peter, having me sing was your idea in the first place.

Peter:
 Hey, hey, hey, I just wanted to keep my bar. The whole reason I built that thing was so that my friends

Lois:
 Is that so? Let me tell you something. I love singing! And I will continue to sing! And-how dare you

Peter:
 Oh, Lois! Hey, watch where you're going, buddy.

Woman:
 Griffin! I got a bone to pick with you.

Peter:
 Whoa, whoa, listen, pal. I don't want any more trouble.

Woman:
 Thanks to your wife, my husband hasn't been home all week!

Loretta:
 Mmm-hmmm.

Peter:
 Oh, yeah, well then do something about it. Come to my basement tonight and drag your husbands out of

Woman:
 Yeah!

Peter:
 Aw, jeez, fella. Can't you take that outside?

Lois:
 This next number is dedicated to my very supportive husband, Peter. Hit it! ? Don't tell me not to fly I've simply gotta? ?If someone takes a spill it's me and not you? ?Don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade?

Peter:
 Oh, boy. Lois is pretty pissed, huh?

Brian:
 Yes, your judgment lately has been rather.... Well, you have crappy judgment, anyway.

Stewie:
 Oh, this is intolerable! This foolishness is preventing me from completing work on...egads! The

Lois:
 Thank you. Aw, look everyone, Stewie drew a picture for his mommy.

Stewie:
 No!

Cleveland:
 Hold up the picture. Let's see.

Stewie:
 No, no! No, no! Nothing to see here.

Man:
 Oh, how cute. It's a time machine!

Stewie:
 No! It's a...blast, what the devil do children draw? It's a pheasant!

Stewie:
 I'll not stand idly by while you abrogate my plans. You shall rue this day. Well, go on! Start ruing!

Lois:
 Bye-bye, Stewie. Mommy will be upstairs to kiss you good night.

Stewie:
 Burn in hell!

Lois:
 Hell. Hell has fire. And you know what else? ? It's got steam heat? ?I got steam heat? ?I got steam heat? ?But I need your love to keep away the cold I got... ?

Woman:
 All right, break it up!

Lois:
 What's going on here?

Woman:
 Your little peep show is over! We're taking back our men!

Lois:
 Peep show? I just do this for fun. Look, all day long I scrub and cook and take care of my kids. And

Woman:
 Not at all.

Loretta:
 Uh-uh.

Lois:
 Peter, you're behind all this?

Peter:
 Yes. And you'll never catch me! [giggles maniacally] [screams repeatedly]

Lois:
 I bet he also didn't tell you he never helps me around the house. Or takes me out to dinner. Or notices

Woman:
 My husband's the same way.

Quagmire:
 Oh, this place is full of dead pigeons. I'm gonna go grab some ozone. Peter! There's a king in the cards!

Stewie:
 They saw my blueprints! What a grievous breach of security! Damn! What do to? Wait for it...wait for it...yes! Instead of moving time forward to bypass this wretched teething, it might just be possible to reverse time's heady flow and undo ever having drawn those damnable blueprints.

Man:
 You'll never get away with this!

Stewie:
 Silence!

Peter:
 Lois, you make it sound like I don't appreciate you at all.

Lois:
 Peter, when was the last time you told me you love me?

Peter:
 You know I do.

Lois:
 I want to hear it!

Peter:
 Is that what this is all about?

Quagmire:
 Run for your lives!

Peter:
 Holy crap! Ah! Hot, hot, hot!

Lois:
 There's no way out!

Stewie:
 At last! My time device is complete! Just one final adjustment. There. Now I shall negate ever having drawn those damnable blueprints. Blast!

Peter:
 Aw, jeez. We're screwed! Look, I promise if we get out of this alive I'm gonna help out around the house and say "I love you" every day.

Lois:
 You mean it?

Peter:
 Ah, I'm a changed man, Lois. A better man. And to think, if I hadn't taken Chris to his soccer game I never would've learned this valuable lesson.

Lois:
 Honey, I'm begging you. Just drop Chris off at his soccer game and come right home. I need you to look after Stewie while I'm teaching piano lessons, please!

Peter:
 All right, all right! You know I spoil you. My foot! I can't walk! I guess you'll have to take Chris yourself. [Giggles]

Stewie:
 Ah! My device! Ah! My teeth!

Incisor:
 I'm free! Free! I claim this mouth in the name of Incisor!

Bicuspid:
 I think not!

Incisor:
 Bicuspid! We meet again.

Bicuspid:
 Have at you!

Incisor:
 En garde!

Bicuspid:
Shall we bite the tongue then?

Incisor:
 On three. One, two...

Stewie:
 [Screams]

Stewie:
 Oh, Machiavelli! You've told me nothing I don't already know! Ah, Sun Tzu's "The Art of War."

Lois:
 Stewie, those books aren't for babies. Here. Watch the Teletubbies.

Stewie:
 How dare you! That book may hold the key to my enslaving of all mankind. Ooh, fuzzy.

Teletubby:
 [giddy laughter] Tickle.

Stewie:
 God, the more I resist, the more intriguing they become! I can't look away!

Teletubbies:
 Again! Again!

Stewie:
 Yes! Yes! Again! Again! Oh, dear God, please once more!

Peter:
 Sorry, Stewie. A&E Biography is doing the life of the other guy from Wham.

Stewie:
 I'm free! Free from the spell of those diabolical Teletubbies! Thank you. When the world is mine, your death shall be quick and painless.

 Weed:
 Attention, please. Tomorrow is softball practice. We have a lot of work to do for Saturday's game. Let's not forget how badly we were humiliated last year by Pawtucket Joke and Novelties.

Pawtucket players:
 [Raucous laughter]

Peter:
 [Peter giggles] Look at those morons and their stupid glasses.

Peter:
 Oh, man. I hate those guys. More than I hate spinach, traffic jams, and the last few years of M* A*S*H. You know, when Alan Alda took over behind the camera and the show got all dramatic and preachy? Huh, am I right? Who's with me?

 Weed:
 This year we will defeat those Pranksters with our secret weapon: Guillermo.

Man:
 [Screaming]

 Weed:
 Bravo! I hired Guillermo because I believe he will be an asset to our company on and off the field.

Weed:
 Back to work, people.

Peter:
 Heya, Mr. Weed, I got a great idea for a new line of TV action figures. Facts of Life Transformers, huh? Watch the transformation: cute as a button/fat as a cow/radioactive scorpion. Huh? Watch out, Mrs. Garrett. Here comes Blair!

 Weed:
 I'll consider it.

Peter:
 He'll consider it! Hey, I got another one where Natalie's one of those spittin' lizards from Jurassic Park.

Contestant:
 Pat, I would like to solve the puzzle. "Go tuck yourself in."

Pat Sajak:
 You got it.

Chris:
 Well, you were close, Dad.

Peter:
 Yeah. I still can't believe we missed the phrase, "My hairy aunt." Come on, Brian. I gotta get to softball practice.

Lois:
 Practice? I thought we were go next door and welcome our new neighbors.

Peter:
 Oh, no, no, no. I don't want anything to do with neighbors. Last guy who lived next door borrowed my toaster. Never saw it again.

Man:
 If that slut wants full custody of the kids, she's got it.

Lois:
 Peter, they might be very nice people.

Peter:
 "Very nice people." Yeah, that's what they always say. Then you open up the septic tank and bam! Skeleton city!

Brian:
 [Panting]

Woman:
 Pervert!

Brian:
 Oh, don't flatter yourself, honey. I don't have any sweat glands.

 Weed:
 Okay, my Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Boys, time for batting practice. Guillermo, you're up. Unfortunately, Johnson isn't here to pitch today. His wife is in labor.

Peter:
 Oh, what? Is the baby coming out of him? Jeez, I'll pitch.

Brian:
 Ha. I don't know what's more questionable, your pitching arm or Bill Clinton's integrity.

Peter:
 Oh, how hard...

Peter:
 Oh, how hard can it be to pitch?

Peter:
 Okay. Take your base.

 Weed:
 Somebody call 911. Tell them he is allergic to penicillin and white zinfandel! Idiot! If you don't find a ringer to replace Guillermo, you're fired!

Peter:
 Oh, man. What am I gonna do if I get fired? I'll have to go back to my old job as a Calvin Klein model.

Guy:
 But I don't want to be different.

Peter:
 What was the name of the bad guy from Tron? Ah, this is gonna drive me nuts!

Lois:
 Moving is never easy on a family.

Bonnie:
 Well, we are gonna miss the go-go-go pace of Providence. But with number two on the way, Joe thought it was time to move. And I can't say no to Joe. Ever.

Lois:
 Oh, Quahog can be pretty exciting, too. Last week, someone lost an eye at Bingo.

Man:
 I-17. Oh, darn it. [screams]

Bonnie:
 Oh, I haven't played Bingo in years!

Stewie:
 Silence! Ever since you two met, you've done nothing but wax idiotic! I must escape this infernal babble! Aagh!

Bonnie:
 [Chuckles] What a little explorer.

Lois:
 Yes. He's so full of wonder.

Stewie:
 Oh, to be the Lindbergh baby right about now.

Bonnie:
 Joe, you have to meet our new neighbor, Lois Griffin.

Joe:
 It's a pleasure, Lois. Who's the little guy?

Lois:
 This is Stewie. Honey, say hi to Mr. Swanson.

Stewie:
 You will bow to me.

Meg:
 Hi. I'm Meg. I live next door.

Kevin:
 I know. I've admired you in the garden from afar.

Meg:
 Will you go out with me?

Kevin:
 I'd love to.

Chris:
 Oh, he's gay.

Meg:
 You wish! Get out of here, you mouth-breather!

Peter:
 I'm as good as fired. Where the hell am I gonna find a guy as strong as Guillermo? One time I walked into the locker room, I swear he was bench-pressing Mr. Weed. Ah, great. Lois is getting chummy with the new neighbors.

Brian:
 I think she wants you to meet them.

Peter:
 She's always making me be social. Cocktail parties, school functions, that time we planted trees in Jerusalem.

Peter:
 What? Look, all I'm saying is put an Israeli guy next to an Arab guy and I can't tell the difference.

Joe:
 You must be Peter. Joe Swanson.

Peter:
 Yeah, yeah. Nice to meet you, Phil. You know, you got a neighbor on the other side of your house, too. So, you know, don't think you always have to bug me.

Joe:
 [laughs] I'll keep that in mind. Say, do you have a screwdriver I can borrow?

Peter:
 Man, you neighbors are like viruses. Starts with a screwdriver. Then before you know it, you're using my supermarket, my dry cleaner, and even my postman. Sheesh, can you believe that guy? "Do you have a screwdriver I can borrow?" What an ass.

Brian:
 So, Peter, did you find a replacement for the team?

Peter:
 No. Believe me, I've been looking.

Manager:
 Hideo-san would be honored to play for your team. But he wishes to know what compensation you offer.

Peter:
 Uh, me love you long time.

Brian:
 Gosh, I'd like to help you, Peter. But I've gotta go out in the hall and chew on the back of my ass for

Lois:
 Oh, Peter, I invited Joe and Bonnie to your game on Saturday.

Peter:
 Lois, I don't want those people there. See, this is why I ask you to submit everything to me in writing first.

Lois:
 Bonnie told me Joe is a big baseball fan. He played in college.

Peter:
 He did?

Peter:
 Welcome to the neighborhood. Hiya, Joe.

Joe:
 Peter!

Peter:
 Oh, don't get up.

Joe:
 This is a surprise. I kinda thought you didn't like me.

Peter:
 Oh, what? Because of what I said this afternoon. Oh, no, no, no. See I have that disease where stuff just pops out of your mouth. Go to hell! Go to hell! Whoops. See what I mean?

Joe:
 Oh, I'm so sorry. I thought maybe I crossed the line when I asked to borrow a screwdriver.

Peter:
 Are you kidding? You can borrow whatever you want.

Joe:
 Great. Say, you don't happen to have any picture wire, do you?

Peter:
 Picture wire? You son of a bitch.

Peter:
 Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! There it goes again.

Joe:
 I don't want to impose.

Peter:
 No problem. That's what neighbors do. You know what else they do? They play on their neighbor's company softball team, like this Saturday. What do you say, neighbor?

Joe:
 Sounds fun.

Peter:
 So much fun it should be illegal like...copyright infringement. [Mickey Mouse voice] See you at the game, Joe.

Pawtucket player:
 Hey, you want a piece of gum?

Quahog player:
 Oh, thanks.

Pawtucket player:
 Ha-ha! That was joke gum.

Quahog player:
 What do you mean?

Pawtucket player:
 Now you're addicted to heroin.

Quahog player:
 I'm cold.

Lois:
 Hey, Peter!

 Weed:
 It's nice that your family is here, Peter. If your ringer doesn't arrive soon, you can spend every day with them-at home.

Peter:
 He'll be here, Mr. Weed. You should see this guy in action. He can hit, he can throw...

 Weed:
 What's he doing in a wheelchair?

 Weed:
 Peter, our new secret weapon is this very attractive paraplegic?

Peter:
 Okay, Joe, you got me. Rise and shine. Come on. Stand and deliver. Get the hell up.

Joe:
 Ha, ha, you're a hoot, Peter.

Umpire:
 Play ball!

Joe:
 Let's do it!

Peter:
 I swear I didn't know. Maybe they won't hit a lot of balls to him.

Joe:
 I got shortstop.

Bonnie:
 The movers tracked grease all over my carpet. I tried everything to get the stain out.

Lois:
 What about lemon juice?

Bonnie:
 What about club soda?

Stewie:
 What about shutting the hell up?

Meg:
 Isn't baseball great? [pause] They say baseball's the national pastime. [longer pause] I can't taste salt.

Peter:
 Ah, crap! Don't hit it to Joe. Please don't hit it to Joe! Please don't hit it to Joe!

Umpire:
 You're out!

Peter:
 All right, Joe! Way to earn that parking space!

Bonnie:
 All right!

Lois:
 Did you see that?

Bonnie:
 That's my Joe!

Stewie:
 What the deuce? Half man, half machine. Why, with that technology, I could escape these wretched harridans! Go, cyborg!

 Weed:
 It all rests on that man's broad, rippling shoulders!

 Weed:
 All right, Joe! Run!

Peter:
 All right, Joe! Come on! Yeah!

 Weed:
 Hurry! Joe! All right! Yes, vamos!

Player:
 Let's hear it for Joe!

Peter:
 Yeah, let's hear it for the guy who found Joe! Yay. Okay. Huh.

Joe:
 That's finger suckin' good, huh? It's an old policemen's recipe. Eat up, everyone. Tonight my wife won't be the only one enjoying a pig in a blanket.

Bonnie:
 Joe, you're so funny.

Joe:
 They love that one down at the precinct.

Peter:
 Ah, this sucks, Brian. Joe is stealing my thunder.

Joe:
 Hey, everybody! Time to limbo!

Brian:
 Face it. He's the life of the party.

Peter:
 Ah, yeah? I'll show you who's the life of the party. Hey, look! Hey! I fell in the pool with my clothes on! How hilarious is that? That is so Peter Griffin. Guys? Huh? Guys?

Joe:
 That's my idea.

 Weed:
 Peter, come here.

Peter:
 Oh, finally. A little recognition.

 Weed:
 Joe has the most wonderful idea.

Joe:
 Hey, I just suggested a line of handi-capable toys. You know, to show kids the fun side of being physically challenged!

Peter:
 Oh, yeah, that's what kids want to play with. Yeah. A Beanie Baby in a bubble. What about my idea? Come on! Tootie morphs into a stink bug.

 Weed:
 Joe, you're exactly the kind of man we need at our company. Peter, make yourself useful. Go get Joe a drink.

Peter:
 Jeez, first he takes my friends. Then he takes my job. But the way I wear my hat.... No. No. He can't take that away from me.

Stewie:
 You! How came you by this metal construct? I demand to know who made you!

Lois:
 Stewie, it's not polite to point. I'm so sorry.

Joe:
 That's okay, Lois. He's just curious about the chair. About 10 years ago, I was investigating a robbery at an orphanage. It was Christmas Eve and some presents had been stolen.

Joe:
 Reach for the sky, dirtbag! All right, pal! You've stolen your last Christmas.

The Grinch:
 You think you have won, you think all is well, but kiss my green ass, I shall see you in hell!

Joe:
 Are you Timmy? Merry Christmas, Timmy.

Stewie:
 Oh, enough! If you won't share your technological schemata with me peaceably, I shall take the information from you by force!

Lois:
 Well, looks like you have a fan.

Peter:
 Come on. Let's get out of here.

Joe:
 Peter, you can't leave.

Peter:
 Sorry, I promised the wife and kids I'd take them on a dream vacation to Hawaii, right now. Say aloha, kids.

Meg:
 What are you talking about? We want to hear more of Mr. Swanson's stories.

Chris:
 He's cool, Dad. He killed a guy.

Joe:
 Well, technically, he was killed by the state, but funny story-he did curse my name just before the injection.

Lois:
 Peter, what's the matter with you?

Peter:
 Why are you guys making such a big deal over Joe? You're not supposed to admire wheelchair people. You're supposed to feel sorry for them. Jeez, when did it become okay to be handicapped?

Lois:
 Don't talk like that! He's a remarkable man, and the rest of your family adores him.

Peter:
 Well, fine, then why don't you all marry him? And if he's so remarkable, let's see him do this. "Hey, look at me, I'm walking. Ooh, I'm a remarkable man."

Peter:
 Well, look who finally came home. Jeez, I thought you were gonna spend all night over at Joe's.

Brian:
 I could have. That man has got magic fingers. He found this one spot behind my ear-forget about it. I thought my leg was never gonna stop.

Peter:
 I don't believe this. My whole family worships the ground that guy can't walk on.

Brian:
 Well, it's not too hard to see why. I mean, the guy's a hero; he makes the world a better place.

Peter:
 Hey, hey, hey, I've done lots of things to help people. Remember that time I sang to the kids down at the Sunday school?

Brian:
 Yes, and you forgot the words.

Peter:
 ? Jesus loves me, he loves me a bunch? ?'Cause he always puts Skippy in my lunch ?

Brian:
 No, no, no, it's not the same thing. Joe puts himself in real danger, every day.

Peter:
 [sighs] You're right. I'll never be that kind of hero...unless I put myself in real danger, too, for my family's sake!

Brian:
 Why are the pretty ones always so dumb?

Stewie:
 [Screaming]

Dispatch radio:
 We hava a gang shooting on Third and Main. Three wounded, one dead.

Brian:
 Is it me, or is rap music just getting lazier?

Peter:
 No, no. It's my new police scanner. This hero thing is gonna be easy once I find the right crime.

Dispatch radio:
 We have a domestic disturbance...

Peter:
 Boring!

Dispatch radio:
 Report of a stabbing at...

Peter:
 Blah blah blah blah blah.

Dispatch radio:
 All units! All units! A major bank robbery is in progress at Quahog Bank and Trust. Suspects are armed and extremely dangerous.

Peter:
 Perfect! Where's Lois and the kids?

Brian:
 Uh, over at Joe's.

Peter:
 Well, go fetch 'em. They're about to see a real hero in action. To the Batcave!

Peter:
 Uh-oh.

Peter:
 Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

Peter:
 You thought Joe was something. You ain't seen nothin' yet.

Lois:
 Peter, what's the big rush?

Peter:
 All right, you guys wait right here. Daddy's gonna make a little withdrawal.

Girl:
 No, don't go.

Peter:
 I hope you brought your striped pajamas, boys. 'cause there's a five-year sleepover at the big house, and you're invited.

Peter:
 Oh, Lois and the kids should be in here to see this.

Brian:
 Yes. It's going very well.

Meg:
 Mom, what do you do when you like a boy but he doesn't even notice you?

Chris:
 Meg loves Kevin.

Meg:
 Shut up, you big sack of dog vomit!

Lois:
 Meg, you're a sweet, lovely girl. He'll come around.

Meg:
 Such a mom answer.

Lois:
 Well, have you tried showing off the goods? How's that for a mom answer?

Meg:
 Creepy.

Lois:
 Oh, I saw some cute dresses down the street. If nothing else, it'll make you feel better. Come on, you guys.

Brian:
 Well, if you want to be a hero, now might be a good time.

Peter:
 Jeez, Brian, this isn't what I was expecting. I thought being a hero would be all fun and games.

Peter:
 Sorry, Wonder Woman, I got three kings. Now let's see your pair.

Peter:
 Haha, all right. Hey, Robin, what are you looking at me for? Look at her.

Peter:
 Don't worry, Brian. I got a plan.

Brian:
 Oh, good. I was afraid you were just gonna improvise.

Peter:
 Oh. Well, actually, I was gonna use the little girl as a human shield and run like hell. But improvise, that'll be easier on my back.

Peter:
 Okay, in this improv, Tammy and the short robber are husband and wife. Okay. And where are we?

Old woman:
 Guadalajara, Mexico!

Peter:
 Okay, okay. I heard pet store. And I'm the gruff but lovable owner. All right. Begin. Hello, married couple. I see you found a puppy.

Peter:
 Well, before you take Sparky home, let me check him for worms. Okay, drop it! All right, you guys. Let's get out of here.

Cop:
 All right, stand back!

Peter:
 Whoa, whoa. Hang on, hang on. Sorry, no one can leave. Listen, the whole reason I saved you guys today was so I could be a hero. See, this wheelchair guy moved in next door and he can do all these great things and, well...

Girl:
 Your family idolizes the lousy cripple and not you?

Peter:
 That's right! How'd you know?

Old woman:
 We've all been there.

Chris:
 Cool! The bank is getting jacked!

Lois:
 Officer, my husband's in there! Can you tell me if he's okay?

Lois:
 He's wearing a white, collared shirt, kind of big, with glasses.

Lois:
 Oh, thank God.

Lois:
 No!

Peter:
 Hey, there's my family.

Peter:
 But...but, I was gonna be a hero.

Bonnie:
 Joe, it's Peter! He's in trouble!

Tom Tucker:
 A failed robbery at Quahog Bank and Trust has led to a terrifying hostage situation. [pause] That's right. A hostage situation.

Joe:
 I gotta go.

Bonnie:
 I know.

Peter:
 Uh, excuse me. Shouldn't that be "whom"?

Peter:
 Crap!

Joe:
 This is Police Lieutenant Joe Swanson. I know we can work this out together.

Peter:
 Aw, jeez, not him again. I hope this place isn't wheelchair accessible.

Lois:
 Bonnie, it's Peter.

Bonnie:
 Don't worry. Joe's an excellent negotiator. I was a virgin when we met. It took him three hours.

Meg:
 I can't believe my dad is in there. [pause] This'll probably scar me for the rest of my life. [pause] I got a new dress.

Meg:
 So do you like music?

Kevin:
 Oh, yeah! I played guitar in a band before we moved. But it interfered with my studies. What do you listen to?

Meg:
 You first.

Kevin:
 I'm into Garbage, Phish, Blur. My parents don't like me listening to that stuff. But I do anyway, because I am not a robot!!! I also like Radiohead.

Joe:
 And even though society has turned its back on you, I promise you there are people who care. And you know what? I'm one of them.

Peter:
 Oh, come on, guys. Don't let him sweet talk you like that. Wait, wait, wait. You can't leave now. I'm supposed to be the hero here. Wait! Can you let me pistol-whip you a couple times for the camera? Dang, stupid robbers

Stewie:
 Aha! Excellent! They detached the human component from the machine. Machine, I am your new master and I order you to go! Engage! Blast! Must be some kind of proprietary command system. Now on the Russian MiG, it's next to the altimeter.

Lois:
 There you are. I can't turn my back on you for a second.

Stewie:
 Augh! One day I shall unlock the secret of that device. And when I do, Mother, victory shall be...

Lois:
 Peter, you had us so worried. What on earth were you trying to prove?

Peter:
 I'm sorry. Joe is a great guy. I guess I was just tired of him being your hero.

Lois:
 Peter, Joe is a hero, but he's not our hero. You are.

Peter:
 Really?

Lois:
 Yeah. You're always right there on the couch for us, making us laugh when we're upset. Changing the channel when something boring comes on. Eating the last slice of pizza so the rest of us don't fight over it.

Meg:
 Yeah, Daddy. And if you hadn't pulled this stunt I never would have learned how to manipulate Kevin.

Chris:
 And when the kids at school see us on TV, they'll think you're a total psycho. And I can say, "That psycho is my dad!"

Michelle Kwan:
 And I would never have won the silver in Nagano, if you hadn't driven me to the ice rink every morning at 6:00 a.m.

Peter:
 I guess being a hero isn't always about saving lives and catching bad guys. It's also about just being there for the people you love.

Old Woman:
 Help! Someone just stole my purse!

Peter:
 Who cares? I don't even know you.

tewie:
 Oh, blasted matriarch! She has failed once again to replenish this frigid box with potations. I'll give her a piece of my mind at once! Agh! Damn it! Now look here, you....oh, my God!

Lois:
 Now you shouldn't be frightened, Stewie. What you saw was actually a very beautiful thing.

Stewie:
 Evidently, madam, you and I differ greatly in our conception of beauty. What I just witnessed was ghastlier than a thousand ghouls!

Lois:
 Stewie, mommies and daddies like to hug each other that way. In fact, sweetie, that's sort of how you were created.

Stewie:
 Ah! That is a vile and odious lie! How dare you fill my head with such loathsome propaganda? Get out, you horrid woman! Get out!

Lois:
 Okay, honey. I'll go get your teddy bear.

Stewie:
 [moaning]

Brian:
 Oh, good Lord, you saw them together, didn't you? You know the tub where you take your little baths? They've done it there, too.

Stewie:
 [Exclaiming]

Scout leader:
 What in the name of our Christian God? You're out of the semicircle! All Scouts have to sit in the semicircle!

Chris:
 Why?

Scout leader:
 Why? Why? Saunders, tell him why!

Saunders:
 Because it's Rule 142-B!

Scout leader:
 Because it's Rule 142-B! Good job, Scout. Now drop and give me 20!

Saunders:
 Thank you, sir!

Scout leader:
 Ladies, this Saturday at 0800 there will be a soapbox derby, as a reward for all your obedience.

Richie:
 Mom, Dad, I really like Potsie.

 Cunningham:
 Why not, dear? Potsie's a very nice boy.

Richie:
 No, Mom. I mean, I really like Potsie.

 Cunningham:
 We heard you the first time, son. You have a homosexual attraction to Potsie.

Brian:
 You have anything on that remote lower than mute?

Peter:
 I got a surprise for you, Chris. Aw, jeez, it'll have to wait. This is the one where the Fonz goes,

Fonzie:
 Heyyyyyyy!

Peter:
 [Laughing] Take that, 1950s society! Okay, let's go.

Peter:
 Chris, this is the speed machine that's gonna win you the soapbox derby.

Chris:
 But, Dad, I was supposed to build it myself. It's a rule.

Peter:
 Ah, come on. Rules were made to be broken. [grunts] Here, let me show you the turbo booster.

Chris:
 Uh, Dad, what would you say if I told you I didn't want to be in the Scouts?

Peter:
 I'd say "Come again?" And then I'd laugh because I said "come." But thank God that's not the case. You're a Scout. And you know what that means? That means I love you.

Chris:
 Meg?

Meg:
 Chris, get out of here! You're not allowed in my room.

Chris:
 I thought that was just when you were asleep.

Meg:
 What do you want?

Chris:
 Meg, I don't want to be in the Scouts anymore. I just want to draw. Listen, I was kinda hoping you could tell Dad. But try and open with a joke.

Meg:
 Tell him yourself.

Chris:
 I can't. I don't want to disappoint him again. You remember what happened when he tried to sneak me into

Peter:
 One, please.

Chris:
 [sneezes]

Ticket Salesman:
 Wait a second! Your ass just sneezed! And horses can't talk! No, no, no! Nothing about this adds up at all!

Meg:
 Okay, look. Dad is really easy. All you have to do is sit on his lap, give him a big kiss on the cheek, look him right in the eye, and he's butter.

Peter:
 What the hell?

Chris:
 Dad, the Scouts are no fun. And I...oh, wait a minute. [kisses Peter]

Peter:
 Chris, I am going to stand up, walk out of this room and we will never speak of this again. [walks out of room]

Chris:
 [Moans]

Pops:
 Speed, I do not think you should be in this race! Ha-ha! The Mach 5 is not ready! Ha-ha!

Speed Racer:
 But Pops, I must be in this race! Ha-ha!

Pops:
 Very well. But I am not really your father! Ha-ha!

Speed Racer:
 [Exclaiming]

Scout leader:
 Okay girls, get ready...

Scout leader:
 ...get set...

Peter:
 Please, uh, uh...God, I don't ask you for much. But let my boy win this race.

Scout leader:
 Do not go until I wave my flag. I can't stress that enough. I'll wave it once just to show you how it looks.

Chris:
 Look out!

Scout leader:
 Griffin is disqualified! Griffin is disqualified! [grunting]

Scout leader:
 Your boy is out of the Scouts!

Peter:
 Jeez, who died and made you President Nixon?

Scout leader:
 Look, it's been two years! Your idiot son hasn't earned a single merit badge. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to administer some spankings.

Peter:
 Ah, come on. Give him a little more time, huh?.

Scout leader:
 All right, all right! You've got three days to earn a badge!

Peter:
 Three days! That's tomorrow! We gotta get going!

Lois:
 Stewie, look what Mommy made for dessert.

Stewie:
 Ooh, Jell-O. How exotic! I feel like I'm on the deck of the QE II.

Peter:
 Me and Chris will take ours to go. We've only got one more night to get that badge.

Chris:
 Uh, Dad, maybe we should just give up. I mean, we tried everything.

Peter:
 We almost got that one for insect study.

Peter:
 Look, Chris. It's a whole family of WASPs.

WASP Father:
 My, Margaret. What a sub-par ham.

WASP Mother:
 Perhaps I can't bake a ham. But what I can cook up is a little grace and civility at the table.

WASP Father:
 Patty, did you know that your mother is a whore?

Lois:
 I think it's great that you and Chris've been spending so much time together. But he's the one who should be earning that badge.

Peter:
 Hey, where do you get off telling me how to raise my son? Oh. Oh, right. Okay. We'll try it your way,

Chris:
 Not anymore, Dad. I'm out. They made me turn in my uniform and everything.

Peter:
 What? Those bastards! Don't you worry, Chris. I'll get you back in!

Chris:
 It's okay, Dad. I'm not really...

Peter:
 Don't take no for an answer, Chris. You're a Griffin. And a Griffin never knows when to stop.

Peter:
 Clear! Clear!

Victim:
 [Gasping] You-you saved my life, Doctor!

Peter:
 Clear!

Peter:
 I'm calling that damn troop leader right now. We're going over his head. Straight to the Youth Scout head office in New York. Pack your bags, you guys! The Griffins are hitting the Big Apple!

Speed Racer:
 Ha-ha! Did you hear? The Griffins are going to New York! Ha-ha!

Pops:
 This does not affect us at all. Ha-ha!

Speed Racer:
 Ha-ha!

Meg:
 I can't believe we're actually going to New York.

Chris:
 Uh, Dad, you don't really have to do this.

Peter:
 Yes, I do. No boy of mine is gonna get booted out of the Scouts.

Chris:
 [moans]

Stewie:
 What the hell do you think you're doing?

Lois:
 Strapping you in, honey, so you don't get hurt.

Stewie:
 So I don't get hurt. That's the best you can come up with, you dull-witted termagant?

Lois:
 I brought your Raffi tape.

Stewie:
 ...Play "Wheels on the Bus" and get the hell out of my sight.

Meg:
 Where's Brian?

Peter:
 Hey, aren't you coming?

Brian:
 Thanks byt no thanks. I've been to New York. It's like Prague sans the whimsy.

Lois:
 Will you be okay by yourself?

Brian:
 Oh, I think I'll manage.

Peter:
 All right, you guys. We're off! Those Scouts are never gonna know what hit them. [backs into neighbor's car] And neither will that guy.

Lois:
 Okay. I'm thinking of a movie.

Chris:
 Is it a musical?

Peter:
 Is it a good movie?

Lois:
 It has its moments.

Peter:
 Cool Runnings.

Lois:
 Right!

Scientist:
 After years of study, I've discovered the secret to longer life in canines. And that secret is...

Narrator:
 We interrupt this program for some episodes of One Day at a Time.

Ann Romano:
 Damn it, Julie. I'm a single mother doing the best damn job she knows how! And damn it, Schneider! I asked you to fix that damn sink two days ago!

Schneider:
 Oh, I'll fix your sink, Ms. Romano. And by that I mean I'll have sex with you. And by have sex

Schneider:
 And by "reproductive organ, " I mean the thing between your knees. And by "the thing between your knees, " I...well, I guess that one's kind of self-explanatory.

Brian:
 [Hollers]

Lois:
 Peter, we're lost. Would you please ask for directions?

Peter:
 We are not lost. And even if we were, you know I can't ask a human being for directions.

Lois:
 Why not?

Peter:
 Because I'm a man. Jeez, haven't you ever seen a stand-up comedian, Lois?

Chris:
 Dad, maybe we should go home.

Peter:
 No way, son. We came to get you back into the Scouts. And that's exactly what we're gonna do. [Gurgling]

Lois:
 What was that?

Peter:
 Nothing. [Gurgling]

Lois:
 Peter, the car is making funny noises.

Peter:
 You're wrong again, Lois. That wasn't the car. Although you were right about that prune smoothie.

Lois:
 Are you okay?

Peter:
 I'll be fine. I just have to concentrate on driving.

Peter:
 [sees "Dump, next left" sign][Groaning] [Gurgling][sees "Wide Load" sign] [sees "Furniture Sale: All stools must go!" sign][Peter groans] [sees "I love my Shih Tzu" sign][Peter groans] [sees "Only 15 Miles to Bob's House of Feces" sign] Oh, come on! That one's not even real! Oh, God! We gotta stop!

Meg:
 Wow! An Indian casino!

Peter:
 Yeah. I gotta find me the stink lodge! [Moaning]

Peter:
 Come on, you guys. No time to lose! Hold it. Hold it! Hold it! [Moaning]

Indian robot:
 How! And welcome to our casino, palefaces. Feel free to visit gift shop in lobby and restaurant on second floor.

Indian Robot:
 Only about the veal!

Robots:
 [Laughing]

Peter:
 Aw, jeez, this is gonna be a photo finish, Lois![Moaning]

Lois:
 I'm gonna ask someone for directions. Meg, watch Stewie. Excuse me. Can you tell me how to get to New York?

Sees You Coming:
 Well, sure. But what's your hurry, ma'am? Don't you want to play a little first?

Lois:
 Thank you. But I really don't approve of, you know, gambling.

Sees You Coming:
 Well, technically, it's not really gambling. It's just us trying to rebuild our shattered culture after you raped our land and defiled our women.

Lois:
 Well, as long as you're not using it for firewater.

Carrot Scalp:
 Look, a "bow" tie. [Singing] I'm David "Bow"ie. "Bow" Derek!

Stewie:
 Oh, very funny! Now tell the one that doesn't suck!

Stewie:
 Oh. thank you. Thank you. Yes, yes. And what's the deal with airline food?

Peter:
 Hey, thanks, "Watches You Pee." Where's your mother?

Chris:
 Over there.

Peter:
 I didn't know you knew how to play poker.

Lois:
 Yeah.

Peter:
 How you doing?

Peter:
 That's good, honey. Let's go.

Lois:
 Yeah. It's funny. I never knew video poker could be so much fun. You win a few hands and all those lights go off. And you just feel so good inside.

Peter:
 Yeah, gambling is great. No question about it.

Lois:
 It felt so good. I just-I kept putting my money in. And before I knew it, I'd lost $40. I'm so embarrassed.

Peter:
 Ah, that's okay. As long as you learned your lesson.

Lois:
 Oh, I did, Peter...for a couple of minutes. Then.... This is so silly. I started playing again.

Peter:
 Jeez, I could swear I parked here.

Lois:
 Yeah, you did. But here's the really silly thing, Peter. I sort of bet our car.

Peter:
 [Exclaiming] Okay, I'm not panic. I just need to go back in the casino and find a high roller who'll pay $1 million to sleep with my wife.

Lois:
 What? That's ridiculous!

Peter:
 C'mon, Lois, these people took $24 for the island of Manhattan. They have no idea what things are worth!

Meg:
 Nice going, Mom. I finally get my driver's license and you lose the car to a poker machine. How ironic.

Peter:
 Hey, don't talk about your mother that way. She is not an i-ron. Now, c'mon, we gotta figure out a way to get to New York and get Chris back into the Scouts.

Chris:
 But Dad...

Peter:
 I got it. I'll just get Brian to wire us some money.

Brian:
 [laughing]

Ann Romano:
 Damn it, Julie! I am not shacking up with my boyfriend. I am just going away for the weekend.

Schneider:
 Yeah. All the away.

Brian:
 [Hooting] Oh, damn, Schneider! What won't you say?

Peter:
 No answer at the house. You didn't bet that, too, did you?

Lois:
 Oh, I'm sorry, Peter. I feel so foolish. It just seemed like such a good cause. Everyone in the tribe gets a share in the casino's profits.

Peter:
 What did you just say?

Lois:
 "I'm sorry, Peter."

Peter:
 After that.

Lois:
 "I feel foolish."

Lois:
 "Casino's profits."

Peter:
 Before that.

Lois:
 "Everyone in the tribe."

Peter:
 Now the whole thing.

Lois:
 "Everyone in the tribe gets a share in the casino's profits?"

Peter:
 That's it! Let's go!

Leonard Cornfeathers:
 I'm sorry to hear about your "misfortune." But we're not allowed to return gambling losses.

Peter:
 Well, I think you can make an exception in our case, Lenny. See, I'm an Indian, too.

 Lois:
 Excuse me?

Peter:
 You heard me. I'm a member of your tribe. And that entitles me to a share of your wampum, kemo sabe.

Leonard Cornfeathers:
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second. Not so fast. Tell me of your history, of your past.

Peter:
 Oh, I come from a long line of...you people. My great-grandfather's name was Jeep Grand Cherokee. I mean, Chief Grand Cherokee. He was a rainmaker.

Chief Grand Cherokee:
 [Native singing] ♪ I'm so happy doing the neutron dance♪ [native singing] ♪I'm just burning doing the neutron dance ♪

Peter:
 And he also killed a bunch of Krauts at Wounded Knee. So are you gonna give me back my car, or what?

Leonard Cornfeathers:
 I have to confer with the council of the elders. You wait right here.

Lois:
 Are you nuts, Peter? You'll never get away with this.

Peter:
 Why not? I've fooled people before. You remember that time I pretended to be gay?

Peter:
 [watching "Caroline in the City"]

Lois:
 Peter, there is no way they're gonna believe you're an Indian.

Indian:
 He's an Indian, all right.

Leonard Cornfeathers:
 How do you know?

Indian:
 I can tell.

Leonard Cornfeathers:
 Oh, you think everyone's an Indian. He could just be another mooch trying to get a cut of our profits.

Frank:
 Maybe we can put him through a test, you know? Like a really impossible stunt to prove he's the real deal.

Leonard Cornfeathers:
 Hey, way to think outside the box, Frank.

Leonard Cornfeathers:
 To prove you are truly a member of our tribe, you must go on a vision quest. Do you know what a vision quest is?

Peter:
 ...Of course I do. I'm an Indian. But why don't you explain it to my wife? She's a little slow in the head.

Leonard Cornfeathers:
 A vision quest is a sacred spiritual journey. Your husband must go out in the wilderness without food or water.

Frank:
 Or shoes.

Leonard Cornfeathers:
 Yeah. Or shoes. He must remain there until he can communicate with nature. He must hear the wisdom of the rocks and trees. And then his guiding spirit must appear to him and reveal a great personal truth. And it's gotta be a real vision. We're Indians. We're gonna know if he's lying.

Indians:
 [Howling ominously]

Leonard Cornfeathers:
 [Laughing] Sucker.

Lois:
 Peter, please don't do this. We can buy another car. I'll give extra piano lessons on Sundays.

Peter:
 Come on, Lois. All I gotta do is have a spiritual vision. I've had one before.

Peter:
 Oh, my God. Brian. There's a message in my Alpha Bits. It says "Ooooo."

Brian:
 Peter, those are Cheerios.

Leonard Cornfeathers:
 You must begin your journey now.

Meg:
 Now's your chance to be alone with Dad.

Chris:
 Are you nuts? I'm not attracted to Dad.

Meg:
 Tell him you don't want to be in Scouts.

Chris:
 Oh. Thanks, Meg.

Meg:
 Yipes.

Chris:
 Dad, can I come?

Peter:
 How about it, Lenny?

Leonard Cornfeathers:
 What the hey? The more the merrier. Now get the hell out of here, you nut, and go have yourself a spiritual vision.

Peter:
 Oh, water! Thank God!

Chris:
 Dad, I'm hungry. Are we gonna die?

Peter:
 Of course not. This isn't the first time I've had to find my own food in the wild.

Little Red Riding Hood:
 [humming]

Peter:
 [shouting]

Little Red Riding Hood:
 [screams]

Peter:
 [Laughing] Dumb broad. [Screaming]

Lois:
 They've been gone for over six hours. How long do these vision quests usually take?

Leonard Cornfeathers:
 Huh? Well, you know, it varies, you know?. It depends on the person's age, and height, and...sign.

Lois:
 You have no idea, do you?

Leonard Cornfeathers:
 Of course I...no.

Lois:
 Well, then, why would you send my husband and son out into the wilderness without any food or supplies?

Leonard Cornfeathers:
 'Cause we really like your car?

Stewie:
 They're dead, you know.

Peter:
 Must eat. Haven't snacked in hours. Can't feel my eyes. Wonder if club-footed midgets get justice in

Peter:
 Yeah. I guess. Oh, my God! I'm communicating with nature! Hey, Tree, if one of you falls and there's no one around, do you make a noise?

Scott:
 Sure. Stand there and bitch! But would any of you take the time to help me?

Fonzie:
 Hey, yo, Griffin!

Peter:
 The Fonz!

Fonzie:
 Heyyyyyy!

Peter:
 What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be in the middle of a Tuscadero sandwich?

Fonzie:
 Yeah. But I'm your spiritual guide, see? And I want to lay a little personal truth on you. Now, Mr. C was like a father to me. And he always listened, you know? And Griffin, right now, your son needs you to listen to him. Whoa!

Peter:
 Sure. Whatever you say. Uh, Fonzie? There's something I always wanted to ask you. You were with a lot of girls. Did you ever get a sexual disease?

Fonzie:
 Herpes twice. And the clap. Heyyyyyy!

Chris:
 Uh, hey, Dad? Can I talk to you?

Peter:
 Not now, son! Oh, uh, sure. Go right ahead.

Chris:
 I don't want to be a Scout, Dad. I just don't have fun there. I guess you're pretty disappointed in me.

Peter:
 Well, yeah!

Chris:
 Dad, this is what I really like to do.

Peter:
 What? You want to draw? Aw, jeez, son, why don't you just stick a knife in my heart? I mean, so, you drew

Chris:
 Yeah. I know they suck.

Peter:
 well, not all of them. Some of these look pretty good.

Chris:
 Really?

Peter:
 Yeah! I didn't know anyone in this family had any talent. Well, except for that one thing your mother does.

Chris:
 You mean play the piano?

Peter:
 No, no. She.... Yeah. I probably don't say this often enough. But I'm really proud of you, Chris.

Chris:
 Thanks, Dad.

Trees:

Peter:
 Let's get out of here!

Tree:
 Todd, you stupid bastard!

Lois:
 Peter? Chris? Oh, thank God. Are you okay?

Peter:
 Fantastic, Lois! I saw my guiding spirit.

Leonard Cornfeathers:
 Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait a second! You had a vision?

Peter:
 It was amazing! I spoke to the trees. And I saw the Fonz.

Lois:
 Really? What's the Fonz like? I bet he's stuck up.

Peter:
 A little. But thanks to him, me and Chris have never been closer.

Leonard Cornfeathers:
 Oh, I want a spiritual vision, too! Man! I guess we've lost touch with our noble roots. I mean, sure this casino's brought our tribe money and prosperity. But what is the price of our souls?

Frank:
 $6 million a week.

Leonard Cornfeathers:
 That sounds about right. Hey, you know what, take your crappy car back. Come on, boys. Let's go hit the buffet.

Peter:
 All right! We did it! Let's get the hell out of here.

Stewie:
 Stupid, greedy savages!

Lois:
 Stewie, that's a terrible thing to say. This one particular tribe has lost their way. But most Native Americans are proud, hardworking people who are true to their spiritual heritage. They are certainly not savages. ["The

Stewie:
 That's funny, Mother. Just this morning you said they were lazy, like the dirty Mexicans. Just kidding. The Mexicans are a clean and industrious people with a rich cultural heritage. ["The More You Know" logo and sound]

Meg:
 Yeah. Not like those dumb, gargantuan Swedes. Actually, the Swedish people run the gamut from very short to tall. And did you know that Sweden gave us the brilliant inventor, Alfred Nobel? ["The More You Know" logo and sound]

Peter:
 Yeah. Which is more than we ever got from those freeloading Canadians. [pause] Canada sucks.

Peter:
 Come on, everyone. That Eight is Enough reunion show is about to start.

Tom Bradford:
 Oh, Mary, have you seen Nicholas?

Mary Bradford:
 He's up in his room sulking, Dad.

Nancy Bradford:
 Yeah. He's still upset because Abby threw out his baseball cards.

Tom Bradford:
 Oh, well, maybe I should make him a sandwich.

All:
 [Laughing]

Nancy Bradford:
 Oh, Dad. That's your solution to everything.

Nancy Bradford:
 [crying]

Mary Bradford:
 Dad! Dad!

Tom Bradford:
 What?

Mary Bradford:
 Eight is enough.

Tom Bradford:
 You know, I love you girls.

Stewie:
 Splendid. That hausfrau's cheap rayon blouses will make a serviceable parachute should I need to abandon my jet in mid-flight. Once it's built, of course. Rupert, did you call that engineer at Lockheed yet? No, of course you didn't, you worthless little.... There! See what you made me do? Do you think I enjoy hitting you? Well, actually, I do. I enjoy it so much I'm going to do it again!

Lois:
 Oh, Stewie! My clothes are not for you to play with, understand? Thanks for telling me, Brian. I don't know what we'd do without you.

Stewie:
 I'm on to you. Oh, yes! Your pathetic attempts to hinder my work have not gone unnoticed. You prance about this house like the cock of the walk. But will you be prancing when...when...when there's nothing to prance about? Hmm? Will you be prancing then?

Brian:
 Oh, you just want to eat him up.

Meg:
 It is so hot out there!

All:
 How hot is it?

Meg:
 I don't know. Like, around 98, 99.

Peter:
 I don't get it.

Meg:
 I think I'm a little sweaty.

Stewie:
 You! You seem to know all the players in this poorly-acted farce. What do they call that one?

Chris:
 That's Meg, dude. You know that.

Stewie:
 Meg! You vile-smelling girl, you're not to touch any of my things! You understand me? Dirty, dirty girl.

Diane Simmons:
 Meanwhile, here at home, Quahog remains in the sweltering grip of a freak heat wave.

Tom Tucker:
 I don't think you should use the word "freak". Some people might find it offensive.

Tom Tucker:
 Finish your oatmeal, son.

Jake Tucker:
 Why bother? I'm just a freak! A freak!

Tom Tucker:
 We're all a little different, Diane. Each of us.

Diane Simmons:
 Good point, Tom. We're even feeling the effects of this heat wave here in our studio. [Sneezing] Freak. So stay inside and stay cool.

Meg:
 I think I saw one of her nipples!

Lois:
 Chris, that's a terrible word! "Nipple." I'll chalk that up to the heat, mister.

Stewie:
 I say, am I to strut about all day like a beggar child on the streets of Calcutta? Fetch me something linen to throw on before I call Child Services!

Lois:
 Please don't threaten Mommy. She's very hot.

Meg:
 Chris, you're hogging up all the fans!

Chris:
 Yeah, well, you're hogging up all the ugly!

Peter:
 Check this out, you guys. The Rhode Island Dog Show Championship is in Quahog this year! First prize is $500!

Lois:
 Really? You know, if you won, we could use that money for a new air conditioner.

Meg:
 Hey, Brian. You could win for sure. You could do your impression of a barbershop quartet.

Brian:
 ? We were sailing along? ?On Moonlight Bay? ?We could hear the voices singing? ?They seemed to say ?

Brian:
 Uh, sorry. I don't do dog shows. It's not my thing.

Peter:
 Come on, Brian. All you gotta do is a few simple commands. And maybe a trick or two. It'll be like taking candy from a baby.

Meg:
 Please, Brian.

Brian:
 I don't know. I mean I don't even know where my papers are. Can't you get the money some other way?

Peter:
 Believe me, I've been trying. That's why I went on that game show.

Alex Trebek:
 For $800, this chemical dye is found in over 95% of all cosmetic products.

Peter:
 Diarrhea.

Audience:
 [Laughter]

Peter:
 What? Oh, oh, sorry, sorry. "What is Diarrhea?"

Peter:
 Come on, Brian. We really need a new air conditioner.

Brian:
 [Groaning]

Peter:
 Okay, let's go over the commands. Sit. Good. Roll over.

Brian:
 Peter, I'm already shvitzing like crazy here. Let's call it a night, huh?

Peter:
 Look, do you want to win this thing or not? We haven't even talked about how you're gonna wear your ears. You know, 'cause I was thinking up.

Brian:
 I need a cocktail.

Lois:
 Don't push too hard, Peter. You gotta take Brian's feelings into consideration. After all, it's only a dog show.

Peter:
 Lois, honey, I love you, but you're sucking all the energy out of the room.

Brian:
 Come.

Lois:
 I got you a little something, you know, for the show. It's Italian. Do you like it?

Brian:
 Oh, it's exquisite.

Lois:
 It's not for every day.

Brian:
 Clearly. I'm gonna put it on right now.

Lois:
 I know how hard you've been working. And, well, the whole family appreciates it.

Brian:
 Thank you, Lois.

Lois:
 I should go. We'll be waiting downstairs whenever you're ready. And Brian-you look very handsome.

Brian:
 [Inhales deeply] Showtime!

Announcer:
 Welcome to the Quahog Dog Show. Today's competition will be almost as hot as the weather, which is once again in the triple digits.

Brian:
 Peter, I'm not, I'm not really comfortable with all this. Do I know you? I-I don't think I can do this.

Peter:
 But you can't back out now. How about a pill? Something to relax you before you go on?

Lois:
 Peter, are you offering Brian drugs?

Peter:
 Not drugs, Lois. Just a little blue thing celebrities take to help them perform.

Lois:
 Well, those celebrities are wrong!

Peter:
 Lois! If Liza is wrong, then I don't want to know what right is.

Stagehand:
 Two minutes to curtain, Miss Minnelli!

Liza Minnelli:
 Come on, baby! Mama's gotta sparkle! It's time to make life a cabaret!

M:
 Lady, for God's sake, I'm just a hard-shelled chocolate candy! Get help!

Stewie:
 [Grunting] You there, child-woman! I'll give you a shiny new dime if you'll roll me into the nearest lake.

Meg:
 Let me see if I can find you a juice box, okay?

Stewie:
 And get the lead out, pudgy!

Announcer:
 Next, Peter Griffin and his dog, "Brain".

Brian:
 Well, we're off to a good start.

Announcer:
 A beautiful performance from "Brain" Griffin!

 Lois:
 Go, Brian!

Peter:
 All right, Brian. We got it all sewn up.

Brian:
 What-what the hell is this?

Peter:
 This? This is the part where you beg for a treat.

Brian:
 Oh, I don't think so.

Peter:
 Brian, you're embarrassing me.

Lois:
 God, he can't expect Brian to do that.

Chris:
 It's easier than it looks, Mom.

Peter:
 Come on, Brian. We had a deal.

Brian:
 Yeah, well, the deal's off. Me and the little shred of dignity I have left will be waiting in the car!

Peter:
 Brian, come! Hey, don't you walk out on me! I now command you to leave. Yep. Keep going. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, flip me off. Good boy. [nervous giggling]

Peter:
 How could you let me down like that, Brian?

Brian:
 Oh, I let you down? Why? Because I refused to demean myself by perpetuating the stereotype of the "good dog"?

Peter:
 This is the one thing I ever asked you to do for this family. Well, you know, this and not do that thing where you drag your ass across the carpet.

Brian:
 Oh, oh, one time I did that, one time!

Lois:
 Peter, Brian, please. Let's just have a nice family car ride like we always do.

Chris:
 Yeah. Except for the time Dad hit that deer.

Peter:
 Yeah, it looks like it's just a ding. Uh, you know, there's no reason get the insurance companies involved.

Deer:
 Well, I should still take down your information, though.

Peter:
 Really? You could probably just buff that out.

Deer:
 Yeah, but I...I would really feel better if I got your information.

Peter:
 You know, you know, Brian, maybe I had you pegged wrong. Maybe you really don't care about this family.

Brian:
 Peter, if you cared about me, you'd never ask me to do something so degrading.

Peter:
 Look, the next time I ask you to do something, I expect you to do it. Understand?

Lois:
 Who wants to sing show tunes? ?In olden days...?

Brian:
 Stop the car.

Peter:
 Is that what you want? Because I'll stop.

Brian:
 Pull over now.

Peter:
 Fine.

Lois:
 Oh, God. Brian, don't do this.

Stewie:
 Is the doggie going bye-bye? Oh, I'm so sad. Quick! Back up!

Brian:
 Oh, great. Is there a problem, Officer?

Cop:
 Can I see your license, boy?

Brian:
 "Boy"? Oh-oh, God. I left it on my other collar.

Cop:
 You been chasing cars tonight, boy?

Brian:
 Look, the name is Brian. I was just out for a little walk. That's all.

Cop:
 Uh-huh, without a leash. I'm gonna have to ask you to lie down on the sidewalk. Down!

Brian:
 I don't believe this.

Peter:
 I don't suppose you could let us off with a warning, huh?

Cop:
 Sorry, sir. But leash laws are for his own good. The fine is $10. You behave, little fella, you hear me?

Brian:
 [Slave voice] Oh, Lordy, Lordy, I'll never roam again! [normal voice] Jackass.

Peter:
 Hey, he's the law outside this house, just like I'm the law inside this house. And you better start obeying both of us.

Brian:
 Oh, look at you. Big man, can't even afford to buy an air conditioner for your family.

Peter:
 Jeez, what a bitch.

Diane Simmons:
 Good morning, Quahog! Well, the heat wave has finally broken, Tom.

Tom Tucker:
 It sure has, Dian. You know what they say, "If you don't like the weather in New England, go back where you came from. "

Diane Simmons:
 Uh, I don't think that's the expression.

Tom Tucker:
 Yeah, I guess I had one too many Bloody Marys this morning. But anyway...[spitting up] Oh, God. I hope the boss isn't watching.

Diane Simmons:
 [uncomfortable laughter]

Peter:
 I don't know how those two manage to be so perky in the morning.

Meg:
 Mmm. Something smells good.

Lois:
 Homemade cinnamon buns, fresh from the tube.

Dough Boy:
 [Giggling] Nothing says "I love you" like something from...hey, what the hell are you doing, you crazy bitch?

Lois:
 These oughta cheer Brian up. Cinnamon buns are his favorite.

Peter:
 Oh, really? I could've sworn his favorite was "treat Peter like crap" buns.

Lois:
 Good morning, Brian. My, your summer coat is really coming in nicely. Isn't it, Peter?

Peter:
 Yeah, yeah. Must be that special jo-jo-ba shampoo I bought you. It cost a little extra. But I would do anything for you, Brian.

Brian:
 I'll be on the veranda since you're already on the cross.

Lois:
 Oh, eat with us, Brian. I made cinnamon buns.

Brian:
 May I have one on a plate, or is Peter planning to balance it on my nose?

Lois:
 Peter, Brian, stop this. Can't you two go back to the way you used to be?

 white cartoon:
 "Peter & Brian 'Fixin' the Shed']

Brian:
 It can never go back to the way things were, not after the way I was treated. Not after the things I've seen.

Chris:
 What did you see? Was it breasts!?

Peter:
 Aw, jeez, get over it, Brian. I mean, how bad do you really have it here? When I found you, you were

Brian:
 You swore you would never speak of that.

Peter:
 Uh, no, thank you. I just had it cleaned. No. Aw, jeez.

Brian:
 All set, sir.

Peter:
 I don't have any change. Sorry.

Brian:
 Oh. Uh, that's okay. No charge.

Peter:
 Wait. [Stammering] You hungry? 'Cause, you know, my wife makes this beef-a-roni casserole. Out of this world.

Peter:
 Look, you got everything you could possibly want, right here. Now, just eat your cinnamon bun and stop being a bad dog.

Brian:
 How dare you? How dare you?

Peter:
 "How dare I? How dare I?" Where do you think you're going?

Brian:
 Out!

Peter:
 Hey, you're not going anywhere without your leash!

Brian:
 I don't need your damn leash, and I don't need you! I'm goin' for a walk.

Peter:
 Don't worry. He won't get far without this.

Brian:
 And a pack of Eldorados, unfiltered. What? Oh, that. Yeah. I'll clean that up on my way out.

Clerk:
 See that sign? Now why don't you go tie yourself up to that parking meter? I don't want any trouble. " Daughter: Mom, have you ever had a problem with "freshness"?

Mother:
 What do you mean, honey?

Daughter:
 You know. Have you ever felt not so fresh?

Mother:
 I'm not sure what you're...I don't follow you.

Daughter:
 Have you ever felt like you're, you know dirty? Down there?

Mother:
 [Exclaiming] Oh, God, no!

Lois:
 Oh, that was Brian's favorite commercial.

Peter:
 "Brian." "Brian." "Brian." No, it's not ringing a bell.

Lois:
 Oh, stop it! We all miss him. Go find him, apologize, and bring him home.

Peter:
 Look-you heard him. He doesn't want to be a part of this family. And we don't need him-we can get another pet.

Chris:
 No way, Dad. No one can take Brian's place.

Stewie:
 Silence! Silence! That mongrel is probably decomposing on the side of a dirt road as we speak. Let's get a kitty!

Peter:
 See, gang? Stewie's got the right idea.

Lois:
 I don't know, Peter.

Peter:
 Lois, trust me. We'll get a lovable kitty-cat and everybody will feel a lot better.

Peter:
 Here, kitty, kitty. Come on down, nice and easy. That's a good kitty. [Gasping] What the hell was that?

Brian:
 Uh, something near a window. Preferably a booth.

Brian:
 Aargh! Yeah, you got 50 Puerto Ricans in the kitchen! Yeah, that's authentic Italian.

Brian:
 Oh, don't do that. That's what they expect you to do.

Tramp:
 [barks]

Brian:
 Okay, fine for you. But what about your puppies? And your puppies' puppies? Am I the only one who's outraged here? I'm sorry. Enjoy your dinner.

Peter:
 Hey, how come you're still setting a place for Brian?

Lois:
 Because when he comes home, I want him to know he never left our thoughts. I know you're thinking about him, too, Peter.

Peter:
 Look, Lois, he broke his promise to me. Besides, we have a new pet. And we love our fluffy kitty.

Woman:
 Oh, gross. Did he just drink from the fountain?

Cop:
 Hey! Hey, you! Stay!

Brian:
 Joyce DeWitt? So that's where you've been.

Joyce DeWitt:
 Shh.

Security Guard:
 Sorry, pooch. You gotta sleep outside. No dogs allowed in the bus station.

Brian:
 My blind guy's in the john.

Security Guard:
 I'll point him in your direction.

Peter:
 [sigh] Brian's tennis ball. Man, he loved to play with this thing.

Referee:
 Double fault!

Brian:
 Augh! Come on, Brian.

Lois:
 Peter, why don't you just admit you miss Brian?

Peter:
 You're right, Lois. Who am I kidding? This family needs Brian. I need him.

Peter:
 God, I hate this freakin' cat.

Brian:
 Can you spare some change?

Man:
 Why? So you can go buy yourself another bottle of booze? Why don't you try and make something of your life, like this dog?

Brian:
 That's me! I mean, that was me.

Man:
 Yeah, sure.

Brian:
 No, I mean it. That was me.

Man:
 Get away from me, you crazy animal!

Brian:
 All right. All right. You want me to be a crazy animal? Okay, I'm a crazy animal!

Man:
 Stop! Help! Help!

Brian:
 All right, who wants to be next? You? You?

Peter:
 Hey, Brian. Brian! I'm here to bring you...

Cop:
 You're going downtown, pal.

Peter:
 ...home.

Brian:
 Hi. How's it going? Oh, God. Uh, I know karate! [Kung fu noises]

Brian:
 Oh, look! A tasty little baby! Well, I see somebody's been neutered.

Felicia:
 Come on, sugar. It's time.

Brian:
 Thank God.

Judge:
 He's cute. Aren't you precious? Lethal injection. Next!

Brian:
 What?

Peter:
 Oh, no! You can't do this!

Stewie:
 Well, who's up for a little lunch, hmm? Something festive. Did someone say Tex-Mex?

Felicia:
 I'm sorry, sugar.

Brian:
 Help me.

Peter:
 Don't worry, buddy. I'll get you out of this! I'm gonna get us the best help there is. <writing letter>

MacGyver:
 Aaugh!

Lois:
 You're looking well.

Brian:
 Don't get too close. They say I'm dangerous. That's why the man's gonna put me down.

Lois:
 Don't say that, Brian. Peter is working on your appeal. You'll see. Everything's gonna work out.

Brian:
 Ha! I may have been born with my eyes closed, but now I see the world for what it is. I'm a second-class citizen, Lois.

Peter:
 Brian! Great news! The City Council agreed to hear your case!

Brian:
 You're kidding! If I prepare my case, I might have a chance after all. Oh, I don't know how to thank you, Peter.

Lois:
 We're family. This is what we do for each other. Right, Peter? Peter, don't stare!

Felicia:
 Oh, good luck, sweetness.

Brian:
 Thanks, Felicia.

Councilman:
 This meeting was called to review the judgment in City of Quahog v. Brian Griffin.

Brian:
 Justice. For all? Or for some? Does a dog not feel? If you scratch him, does his leg not shake? Yes, he is man's best friend. But what, what manner of friend is man? I would like to cite, if I may, the case of Plessy v. Ferguson...

Councilman:
 Wait a minute. Why are we listening to a dog? Take him away!

Brian:
 But, but does not every dog have his day?

Peter:
 Wait! Please! Please! I gotta say something! Look, all Brian's ever wanted is the same respect he gives

Lois:
 Peter...

Peter:
 Okay, okay, okay. Look. The point is, he's a member of our family first and a dog second. And I'm real sorry I forgot that, buddy. Sometimes we all need a second chance. Sometimes we all need to forgive!

Chris:
 I stole $10 from Meg's room!

Meg:
 I stole $10 from Mom's purse!

Lois:
 I've been making counterfeit $10 bills for years.

Councilman:
 Mr. Griffin, this dog is a danger to society. Albeit an articulate and charismatic one. But the law is the law and can't be circumvented by pretty words.

Peter:
 I'll give you each $20.

councilman:
 Deal. He can go.

Stewie:
 Mistrial, damn you! Mistrial!

Cop:
 No. Let him go.

Lois:
 Anybody want more pizza rolls?

Peter:
 Yeah. Quiet, Lois. Murder She Wrote.

Jessica Fletcher:
 Charles Montrose, after all these years.

Charles Montrose:
 Jessica Fletcher! Why, I haven't seen you since you had the, the...

Jessica Fletcher:
 You can say it, Charles. I'm not ashamed. Abortion.

Peter:
 Aha! So she's the murderer!

Lois:
 Come on, kids. Bedtime. Good night, Brian. And welcome home.

Chris:
 Good night, you guys.

Meg:
 Good night.

Stewie:
 Dog?

Brian:
 Yeah?

Brian:
 If you ever tell anyone about that, I will kill you.

Stewie:
 I say, Mother, this hot dog has been on my plate for a full minute and it hasn't yet cut itself.

Lois:
 Honey, I'll be right there.

Stewie:
 Oh, by all means, take your time. Oh, and when you do finally get around to it, I'll be the one covered

Meg:
 Mom, there is no way I'm sleeping in Chris' room this weekend! It smells like old milk in there!

Chris:
 Hey, if I could find it, I'd clean it up!

Lois:
 Kids, keep it down. I haven't even told your father that <whisper> Aunt Marguerite is coming to visit.

Peter:
 Who said Marguerite?

Lois:
 Peter, it's just for a week.

Peter:
 A week! Aw, jeez. No, no, no, no. Please, God, kill me now. No, no, damn, damn, crap, damn it to hell, son of a...

Peter:
 Lois, sometimes it's appropriate to swear.

Bailiff:
 Do you swear to tell the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

Peter:
 I do. You bastard.

Lois:
 I love Aunt Marguerite. Because if it wasn't for her, I never would've met you, Peter.

Lois:
 Aunt Marguerite, have you seen my towel?

Aunt Marguerite:
 Have the towel boy bring you another.

Lois:
 I don't want to bother him.

Aunt Marguerite:
 Nonsense, dear. You're a Pewterschmidt. Towel boy!

Peter:
 Hi, my name is towel. I have a Peter for you. My name is Peter, and I'll be your nipples...towel boy! Aw, jeez.

Lois:
 Okay, everyone. Give Aunt Marguerite a big Griffin family welcome. Aunt Marguerite!

Aunt Marguerite:
 Lois! [gasp]

Lois:
 Oh, my God! She's dead!

Peter:
 Whoa! Careful what you wish for, huh, Lois?

Chris:
 What if they bury her, and she like, wakes up because she wasn't really dead, she was only sleeping?

Meg:
 Yeah. That's what happened to our big brother, Jimmy. That's why Mom and Dad adopted you.

Chris:
 What?

Lois:
 Peter, you remember Coco, my friend from Newport?

Coco:
 Peter, I almost didn't recognize you without a towel on your arm. Lois, where are your parents? Don't tell me they're still on safari.

Lois:
 You know Daddy. He won't rest until he kills something on every continent. But I'm hoping they'll be back in time for Christmas.

Peter:
 Yeah, it just wouldn't be Christmas without your parents.

Carter:
 Oh, I dropped my watch. Peter, would you be a sport and fetch it for me?

Peter:
 Sure thing, Mr. Pewterschmidt. [Screaming]

Carter:
 Peter, we've got to put that out!

Peter:
 Ow! Ow! Ow!

Peter:
 I'm telling you, Brian, nothing changes. These bluebeards still treat me like scum, just 'cause I'm not loaded. Well, I got news for them. I am as elegant as anyone in this room.

Lois:
 Peter, we have to meet with Aunt Marguerite's lawyer tomorrow. She left us something in her will.

Peter:
 Holy crap! Ah, you sweet old broad, I love you!

Peter:
 [humming] Oh, my God. She's dead.

Lawyer:
 Madam Pewterschmidt's passing has saddened us all.

Peter:
 Yeah, it's a real tragedy. What did we get? What did we get? Come on, big money, big money, big money! No whammy! No whammy! Stop!

Lois:
 Peter, please! I'm sorry. He's stricken with grief.

Lawyer:
 Before she passed, your aunt recorded a message for you.

Robin Leach:
 Newport, Rhode Island. Home of New England's most elegant and historic estates: the Breakers, Rosecliff, and exquisite Cherrywood Manor, the palatial mansion of Marguerite Pewterschmidt. Marguerite is a shining example of how people with a lot of money are just plain better than everyone else.

Aunt Marguerite:
 Lois, you were always my favorite niece. I just knew you'd find a wonderful man who would make all your dreams come true. But I was wrong.

Peter:
 And now you're dead. Score one for Peter.

Lois:
 Shhh!

Aunt Marguerite:
 It's time you started living like a Pewterschmidt. That's why I'm giving you my summer home in Newport.

Lois:
 Cherrywood? That's so generous of Aunt Marguerite.

Peter:
 Our own summer house! Now I feel kinda bad for doing that thing with her toothbrush.

Servants:
 ?We only live to kiss your ass.?

Sebastian:
 Kiss it? And we'll even wipe it for you!

Servants:
 ?From here on in, it's Easy Street.?

Peter:
 Any bars on that street?

Sebastian:
 24 happy hours a day.

Peter:
 Oh, boy!

Servants:
 ?We'll stop Jehovah's at the gate.?

Guard:
 Can I see that pamphlet, sir? <Whacks Jehovah's Witness with the pamphlet and smiles.>

Peter:
 ?My God, this house is freakin' sweet.?

Chef:
 ?I make brunch, Clive cooks lunch,?

Chef and Clive:
 ?each and every day.?

Blake:
 ?Chocolate cake, a la Blake!?

Peter:
 ?Hundred bucks: Blake is gay.?

Servants:
 ?We'll do the best we can with Meg.?

Meg:
 Are you sayin' I'm ugly?

Servant:
 It doesn't matter, dear. You're rich now!

Servants:
 ?We'll do your nails and rub your feet.?

Lois:
 Oh that's not nece-oh my.

Servants:
 ?We'll do your homework every night.?

Chris:
 It's really hard.

Sebastian:
 That's why we got that Stephen Hawking guy.

Peter:
 ?My God, this house is freakin' sweet!? ?Used to pass lots of gas; Lois ran away. Now we've got 30 rooms! Hello, beans. Goodbye, spray!?

Servants:
 ?We'd take a bullet just for you.?

Stewie:
 Oh, what a coincidence, I've got one.

Lois:
 Stewie!

Servants:
 ?Prepare to suck that golden teat. Now that you're stinking rich, we'll gladly be your bitch.?

Peter:
 ?My god, this house is-?

All:
 ?freakin' sweet!? Welcome!

Servant:
 That's a wrap, people. Now let's get the hell out of here.

Peter:
 Wait a second, where you going?

Servant:
 The old bag only paid us up through the song.

Lois:
 Well, we can just pick up after ourselves. After all, we'll only be here on weekends.

Peter:
 No, no, Lois. It's time you started living like the piece of Schmidt you are.

Lois:
 That's "Pewterschmidt."

Peter:
 W-W-Wait, you guys! You guys, you're all hired to be full time Griffin servants.

Lois:
 Peter, where are we going to get the money to pay all these people?

Peter:
 Simple. I, uh, sold our house in Quahog.

Lois:
 You sold our home?!

Peter:
 Surprise!

Lois:
 Peter, how could you?

Peter:
 Whoops. ?I recognize that tone. Tonight I sleep alone. But still?

All:
 ?this house is freakin' sweet!?

Lois:
 Peter, how could you sell our house in Quahog without even asking me?

Peter:
 Ah, honey, this is where you belong. You deserve a big house and nice stuff. Like diamonds.

Lois:
 But I love our old house. You have to buy it back.

Peter:
 It's too late for that. Our stuff is packed. It's on its way here. Come on, Lois, you'll love living in Newport. Sure, this house is big, but it's also very intimate. [Echoing] Intimate. Intimate.

Meg:
 So we're really gonna live here now?

[echo:
 "Intimate"]

Peter:
 That's right, honey.

Meg:
 Please, Mom. Look, there's a pool.

Chris:
 Yeah. And there's a chair.

Sebastian:
 The solarium is at the far end of the west wing.

Twins:
 Come play with us, Stewie, forever and ever and ever.

Stewie:
 Yes. All work and no play makes Stewie a dull boy.

Sebastian:
 Across the hall from the library we have the billiard room. And here we have the lounge.

Brian:
 Sweet Mary, mother of God! Jackpot!

Bartender:
 What can I get you, sir? We have 10 varieties of single malt scotch and a wine cellar with over 10,000 bottles.

Brian:
 Don't make me beg.

Lois:
 Well, I did love spending time here when I was a kid.

Chris:
 All right, Mom!

Coco:
 Jonathan and I just returned from sailing our yacht around the world.

Peter:
 Oh, oh. Funny sailing story. All right, this guy's on his boat, in the middle of the ocean, right, and he sees a little black dog. And let me tell you, this dog's been swimming for days, and he stinks like a dead otter, right?

Lois:
 Peter, maybe this isn't the place for...

Peter:
 Hang on, Lois, hang on. So the guy takes the dog into the vet. And the freakin' vet tells him, get this, "It's not a dog. It's a rat." A big, stinkin' Mexican rat. True story.

Meg:
 Dad, that's just an urban legend.

Peter:
 Hand to God. I'm telling you, it was a huge freakin' rat. Five times as big as that guy's steak.

Lois:
 Oh, Peter, that rat gets bigger every time you tell this story.

Peter:
 Oh, I got a million of them. Like the time my buddy's sister's boss, he was drinking with a hooker in this Vegas bar. Bam! Woke up without his kidney.

Man:
 [Vomiting]

Peter:
 I can't believe they kicked me out of the yacht club. I barely had time to stuff Lois' salmon in my jacket.

Brian:
 Face it, Peter. You have a knack for saying the wrong thing.

Peter:
 This sucks. Lois' friend "Yacht boy" and his lovely wife "Caca" invited us to some hoity-toity auction tomorrow afternoon. I don't want to embarrass her again. You gotta help me, Brian. Teach me how to be a gentleman.

Brian:
 Well, Peter, it's not really that hard. Let's start with polite conversation. For example, "It's a pleasure to see you again. Lovely weather we're having." Now you try.

Peter:
 "It's a pleasure to see you again. After Hogan's Heroes, Bob Crane got his skull crushed in by a friend who videotaped him having rough sex." How's that?

Brian:
 Wow, perfect. My work is done. But just for the heck of it, let's try again.

Sebastian:
 More coffee, madam?

Lois:
 I can get that, Sebastian. To tell you the truth, we're all a little uncomfortable being waited on.

Stewie:
 Cut my egg!

Servant:
 Your eggs are cut, sir.

Stewie:
 Cut my milk!

Servant:
 I can't, sir. It's liquid.

Stewie:
 Imbecile! Freeze it, then cut it! If you question me again, I'll put you on diaper detail. And I promise, I won't make it easy for you!

Lois:
 Oh, Meg, you're gonna love Newport High. It has a beautiful campus.

Meg:
 Yeah, filled with beautiful people. And I'm gonna bag me a rich one.

Lois:
 Meg, that's a terrible thing to say. You should marry someone you love. That's what I did.

Meg:
 Yeah, and he got us kicked out of the yacht club.

Lois:
 Oh, you can't be mad at your father for being himself. That's the reason I fell in love with him in the first place. Oh, he was so different from everyone else.

Jonathan:
 Coco, the day I graduate from Harvard I'm gonna carry you off into the sunset on a white horse.

Coco:
 It better be a stretch horse with leather seats and a chauffeur.

Jonathan:
 Isn't she a bit of terrific?

Both:
 [Laughing]

Lois:
 Kids, if you marry for love, your life will be filled with its own riches. Money doesn't buy happiness.

Stewie:
 Oh, I beg to differ. [Rings bells] You! Bring me The Wall Street Journal! You two, fight to the death!

Brian:
 Okay, Peter, I was hoping I wouldn't have to resort to shock therapy, but your progress has been.... Well, who are we kidding? You haven't made any progress. Now, the left TV is tuned to Frasier. The right TV has Ricki

Peter:
 Got it.

Niles:
 Well, Frasier, you're so corpulent that when you sit around the magnificently appointed Tuscan villa, you sit around the magnificently appointed Tuscan villa.

Peter:
 Huh. This is the smartest show on TV.

Guest:
 Yo, Ricki. That's my girlfriend. She ain't supposed to be having no penis!

Peter:
 [Electricity surging]

Sebastian:
 Master Brian, do you really believe you can pass him off as a gentleman at the auction?

Brian:
 Well, we've got a long road ahead. But, hey, I've worked miracles before.

Presenter:
 And the Oscar goes to Marisa Tomei!

Lois:
 Peter was supposed to meet us here an hour ago. I hope he didn't change his mind.

Brian:
 Maybe he's already here. Maybe he's fitting in so well, we just can't tell him from the other bluebloods.

Lois:
 Well, I don't think we have to worry about that.

Footman:
 Lord Peter Lowenbrau Griffin the First.

Peter:
 Play me down the stairs, boys.

Peter:
 Good day. Enchanté. Pasta Fazul.

Peter:
 Looking good, fellas.

Lois:
 Brian, do you know anything about this?

Brian:
 Lois, please. I'm just a dog. A stupid dog. Vodka stinger with a whiskey back. And step on it!

Coco:
 Peter, you're simply enchanting. You must join us tomorrow for a game of baccarat.

Peter:
 Right baccarat at you.

 Jonathan:
 [Laughing]

Lois:
 Brian, what happened to Peter? He's not cramming hors d'oeuvres in his mouth, or asking anyone to pull his finger. That's not the man I married.

Brian:
 So, I guess, technically, that-that makes you available.

Brian:
 Lighten up, toots. It's a party. [Laughing] Hey, barkeep, it's like the damn Sahara over here! How you doing, honey?

Lord Brandywine:
 Welcome to the Historical Society auction. Our first item is a 17th-century gilded vessel. We'll start the bidding at $140,000.

Peter:
 What a marvelous vessel. It would look smashing in Lois's crapper. I mean "crapier".

Coco:
 You are so right. Any woman would love to have that vase adorn her...crapier. Jonathan!

Jonathan:
 Oh. Uh, $140,000.

Peter:
 $150,000.

Lois:
 Brian, that sounded like Peter.

Brian:
 Hey, come here, you! [Laughing]

Jonathan:
 $160,000.

Peter:
 $170,000.

Jonathan:
 $180,000.

Peter:
 $190,000.

Jonathan:
 $200,000.

Lord Brandywine:
 We have a new record for the Historical Society! The vessel goes to...

Peter:
 $100 million!

Lord Brandywine:
 To Mr. Peter Griffin for an astonishing $100 million!

Brian:
 ? ...Money, money, money! ?

Coco:
 Peter, we had no idea you were such a philanthropist.

Woman:
 It's a fabulous vase, Peter, darling. Do you collect objets d'art?

Peter:
 If that's French for "Star Wars collectors glasses," then sí.

Rich people:
 [Laughing]

Lord Brandywine:
 Mr. Griffin, you're the most generous man since Ted Turner.

Ted Turner:
 I'd like to announce I'm giving a gift the whole world can appreciate. I've colorized the moon.

Lois:
 Peter, you don't have $100 million!

Peter:
 Of course I do, my dear.

Lord Brandywine:
 Now, would that be cash or check?

Peter:
 Drop by Cherrywood this evening. I'll have the money wired to me from my Swiss bank account.

Lord Brandywine:
 Very good, sir.

Lois:
 You don't have a Swiss bank account!

Peter:
 Right. [aside to Brandywine] My lawyer's advised me to keep some of my assets a secret, in case things don't work out.

Lois:
 I'm going home. Where's Brian?

Brian:
 Listen, I told this blonde inside I got a 500SL. Can you help me out?

Lois:
 I'm sorry. But I've made my decision. We're moving back to Quahog just as soon as we can get packed.

Meg:
 Ugh, Quahog, that one-horse town?

Horse:
 Shut up. No, you shut up. No, you shut up. You shut up. You're the one talking. Well, there's no one else here. Look, everybody just shut up! What's that? The wind!

Peter:
 A pox on Quahog!

Brian:
 Easy!

Chris:
 If I ever go back to Quahog, it'll be just so I can poke poor people with a stick!

Peter:
 Bon Jovi, everyone.

Lois:
 Now I remember why I left Newport! It changes people. You kids have lost your values. You've lost your mind! And I don't much care for Stewie's new friends.

Man:
 The Pacific Rim economy is still a tad shaky for my taste.

Stewie:
 Oh, oh, stop it, stop it! You can't become a bloody fiscal hermit crab every time the Nikkei undergoes a correction! Asia's market has nowhere to go but up!

Man:
 Interesting.

Stewie:
 Indeed.

Lois:
 I wish we'd never come here in the first place.

Peter:
 [Sighing snobbishly] Here, go buy yourself some more money.

Peter:
 Hey, old bean. Hey, what are you doing with my Star Wars glass?

Brian:
 Illustrating a point. Peter, when Han Solo took the Millennium Falcon to Cloud City, he found that Lando Calrissian had turned control of the station over to Darth Vader. Lando had forgotten who he was. It was only after Han was encased in carbonite and taken by Boba Fett to Jabba's palace, that he was able to see the error of his ways. Look inside yourself. You're not a Newport millionaire. I created you. In a way, I am your father.

Peter:
 That's not true! That's impossible.

Brian:
 Damn it, Peter! Snap out of it!

Peter:
 No! I just had the craziest dream where I bought a $100 million vase.

Sebastian:
 A Mr. Brandywine from the Historical Society is at the front gate. He'll be here in half an hour.

Brian:
 That wasn't a dream, Peter. He's here for the money.

Peter:
 Oh, Brian, I'm screwed. If I welsh on that debt, I'm just gonna prove to everyone that I'm not good enough for Lois. If I only had something worth that much money. Man, I never should've dropped "Mean" Joe Greene's jersey.

Peter:
 Good game, "Mean" Joe. You want some of my Coke?

 Joe Greene:
 Hey, kid. Catch.

Peter:
 Wow. Thanks, "Mean" Joe.

Peter:
 Hey, what about this house? I could give him the house and call it even.

Brian:
 Cherrywood isn't worth $100 million.

Peter:
 Brian, it's the Historical Society. Look, we just gotta convince him that $100 million worth of history happened here.

Lord Brandywine:
 So you're saying that Jesus carved his name into this mantle 51 years before he was born.

Peter:
 Yeah. He's Jesus. He can do anything. And look over here. That's where the stock market crashed.

Lord Brandywine:
 Mr. Griffin!

Peter:
 Oh, I'm tellin' you, you can't take a step in this house without uncovering something historical.

Peter:
 Wait a second. Could that be Harriet Tubman's secret underground railroad? It is! Go, Freedom Train! Go!

Lord Brandywine:
 I've seen enough. I happen to know that nothing of historical significance ever occurred here.

Peter:
 Wait, wait, wait! Look, this is where the Pilgrims landed at Fraggle Rock!

Lois:
 Excuse me, Lord Griffin. Your family is going back to Quahog. If you get tired of being a snob, look us up.

Peter:
 Lord Griffin is dead. It's just me, Peter the towel boy.

Lois:
 Peter, you're back! Oh, let's go home!

Peter:
 We can't. I sold our home. Our beautiful home with the stolen cable and the little man with the penis for the light switch.

Lois:
 So, we'll find another place.

Peter:
 Your Aunt Marguerite is probably laughing at me while she's burning in Hell, may she rest in peace. She was right. Everyone was right. I'm not good enough for you.

Lois:
 Peter, I don't care what anyone else thinks. All that matters is that I love you.

Peter:
 I love you, too, Lois.

Peter:
 [gasp] Lois, our problems are over!

Peter:
Our mansion is historical, all right. Cherrywood was America's first presidential whorehouse! See, there's Lincoln, Grant, Robert E. Lee.

Lord Brandywine:
 Those are fake!

Peter:
 Oh, they're real. And, FYI, Lincoln had the jungle fever.

 Huxtable:
 So you see, Chubby Franklin lived across the street, you see. Chubby Franklin would always make a face like this.

Theo:
 Dad, you're not listening. I have a serious problem. I got a girl pregnant. What do I do?

 Huxtable:
 And when we saw Chubby Franklin make his face, we would all make this face.

Theo:
 Oh, God! Oh, my God!

Meg:
 Hey, Dad, you never did tell us how you got our house back.

Peter:
 Simple. I just offered the people I sold it to double what they paid.

Lois:
 What? But how could you afford that?

Peter:
 I kept one of those Lincoln pictures and held a little auction of my own. Thanks to old Honest Abe we have our house back, and I learned a valuable lesson. It doesn't matter if your family doesn't think I'm good enough for you.

Peter:
 No, because your ancestors were nothing but a bunch of pimps and whores. [Laughing]

Doctor:
 Mrs. Lipstein, I have bad news. The tumor is malignant. I'm afraid you only have six months to live.

Woman:
 Oh, my God!

Announcer:
 Got milk?

Peter:
 Hey, listen up, everybody. Your Grandpa Griffin is finally retiring.

Meg:
 Grandpa Griffin?

Chris:
 Is he that guy who smells like firewood and has those big gray pussywillows in his ears?

Lois:
 Chris, that's a terrible word. "Pussywillows."

Peter:
 My dad worked at that mill for 60 years. That's almost 80 years. Tomorrow night they're throwing a big dinner, and we're all going to be there to honor him.

Meg:
 Why? We barely know him.

Chris:
 Yeah. How come he never visits us?

Lois:
 Well, kids, your grandfather has never been comfortable with the fact that I'm not Catholic.

Peter:
 Hey, hey, hey, Dad loves all of us. He's just too busy working to show it. He's been that way ever since I was a kid.

Man:
 And now the winners of the father-son three-legged race: First place, Bobby Hamill and his dad. Second place, Jimmy Lawson and his dad. Third place, Peter Griffin and a stalk of corn.

Peter:
 Now that he's retiring, me and him can finally spend some time together. I want us to have one of those father-son moments, like on TV. You know, where we hug and the music goes la-la-la.

Peter:
 Thanks, boys. Just like that.

Brian:
 Hey, can you guys do that fluttery thing, like when the Brady kids run down the stairs?

Cindy Brady:
 I don't want to tattle. But is Bobby really a doctor?

Meg:
 Mom, I can't eat. I'm too grossed out by Grandpa's ears.

Chris:
 I know. They're like a big, gray, enchanted forest.

Lois:
 Kids, your grandfather's ears are not gross. And they are certainly not an enchanted forest.

Man:
 [blows noisemaker] But seriously, tonight we here at Pawtucket Mill celebrate the career of our oldest and most dedicated employee, Francis Griffin. Francis?

Francis:
 At mass this morning, it occurred to me that I may never see any of your faces again. I just want to say that Jesus loves you. But in my eyes, you're a bunch of sinners and slackers who forced a hard-working old man to retire. So you can take this shiny watch and shove it.

Stewie:
 I adore this man!

Peter:
 That was some speech, Dad.

Lois:
 Yes. It's a shame Grandma wasn't there to hear it.

Francis:
 Bless her heart. She's on another one of her prayer missions in Las Vegas.

s Mom:
 Hit me, you five-card stud. [Hacking cough] Cocktail!

Francis:
 Aye, she's a rose. It's a pity you couldn't find yourself a nice Irish Catholic girl, Peter.

Lois:
 Oh ho ho. Francis, this must be embarrassing for you. I'm in the car.

Peter:
 Dad, now that you're retired, you're coming to stay with us. No more excuses. I'm putting my foot down.

Peter:
 Brian, buckle up. What do you say, Dad?

Francis:
 I don't want to be a bother.

Peter:
 It's no bother, is it, Lois?

Lois:
 Of course not. It'll be fun.

Francis:
 You're a good woman, Lois. Perhaps you won't burn in Hell after all. Maybe you'll just go to purgatory with all the unbaptized babies.

Peter:
 Hey, there you go, Lois. You love kids.

Peter:
 Look at that. Dad's reading Stewie to sleep, just like he never did for me.

Francis:
 <reading Bible> "So God cast the pagans and sinners into the fiery bowels of Hell, where their flesh burned in agony forever and ever." The end. Ah, children love a good bedtime story from the Bible.

Stewie:
 Yes, charming. Like when God told Abraham to kill Isaac.

Isaac:
 Hey!

Francis:
 [yawning] That was a lovely service, Francis.

Meg:
 Super. And only three more hours till school.

Chris:
 I didn't even know there was a 5:00 a.m. Mass. I didn't even know there was a 5:00 a.m. What else haven't you told me?

Stewie:
 You know, I rather like this God fellow. He's very theatrical, you know. A pestilence here and a plague there. Omnipotence! Got to get me some of that.

Peter:
 Yes. We all enjoy the Bible in this house.

Francis:
 Really? What's your favorite book of the Bible?

Peter:
 Uh, that one where Jesus swallows the puzzle piece and the man in the big yellow hat has to take him to the hospital.

Francis:
 [Knocking] Open this door! Open it, I say!

Chris:
 Sorry, Grandpa. Uh, you might want to give that a minute or two.

Francis:
 I know what you're doing in there, and it's a sin! If you ever do it again, you'll burn in Hell!

Chris:
 But I do it every day. Sometimes twice.

Francis:
 Mark my words, lad. You may think you're alone in there, but God's watching. Don't do it again!

Chris:
 God's watching me do number two? Oh, man. I'm a sinner, and God's a pervert.

Francis:
 Megan! How was school?

Meg:
 Good. Kevin walked me home.

Francis:
 Kevin?

Meg:
 He lives next door.

Francis:
 He lives next door to a harlot!

Meg:
 Grandpa, we were just holding hands.

Francis:
 Well, it'll be easy for him to take your hand when God strikes your sinful heart with leprosy. He can take it right home with him! Lord, it's great to see you kids.

Lois:
 Francis, we were watching that.

Francis:
 Well, I'll tell you how it ends. Laura burns the roast, and God kills her for parading her bum around in those pants!

Peter:
 Yeah, not a bad way to kick off your retirement, huh, Dad? Yeah, the magic of baseball has brought fathers and sons together for millions of years.

Francis:
 [mutters]

Peter:
 Stewie's having fun.

Stewie:
 Why does that man drop his club before he runs around? I would bring it with me.

Peter:
 Hey, who wants a Fenway frank? Nothing says, "Please talk to me, Daddy," like a Fenway frank.

Chris:
 Is there a bathroom here? I don't think I can wait anymore.

Francis:
 In a public restroom, lad? For the good of your soul, show some restraint.

Peter:
 Hey, hot dog guy!

Francis:
 I'll get him.

Peter:
 Oh, no, no, Dad, they bring them to you.

Francis:
 Well, la-di-da. I don't need my food brought to me. I'm not a broken-down old mule! I can still work! I can still take orders!

Peter:
 Oh, hey! Hey, look! Hey, Dad! Hey, Dad, look! Hey, Dad! Dad! Aw, crap. That was money well-spent.

Lois:
 He just left without saying anything? Where would he go?

Peter:
 I don't know. I asked him to buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks.

Brian:
 I don't care if he ever gets back. I wasn't being cute. I really hope he's dead.

Diane Simmons:
 Well, Tom, the city of Boston is examining its conscience tonight in preparation for a visit from the Pope.

Tom Tucker:
 That's right, Diane. And I'll tell you what else will be examined, this cock. Yes, the Rhode Island Cock Society will be sponsoring free check-ups for this year's Cock Awareness Week. I don't know why they went with such a suggestive name. They could've just as easily gone with "rooster." Diane?

Peter:
 I'm telling you. Something must've happened to him. He's probably hurt, or lost, or shanghaied by pirates! That renegade pirate ship captained by the ruthless Peg Leg Swantoon!

Lois:
 Peter, calm down. It's his first night of retirement. He's probably out enjoying himself.

Brian:
 He's in jail.

Peter:
 Dad, my God, are you okay?

Francis:
 Don't be using the Lord's name in vain!

Peter:
 He's okay! Thank God!

Cop:
 It seems he broke into the old mill after hours. We found him working at a kick press.

Peter:
 Dad, you left the ball game with me to go work in a mill?

Francis:
 Yes! I want to work! I want my job back!

Peter:
 But, Dad, you're retired.

Francis:
 I'd rather be dead.

Vaudville Tumbler:
 Dead? I'll tell you what's dead. Vaudeville. You know what killed it? The talkie pictures. But you can still make it, kid. You just need a gimmick. I, for one, am a tumbler. Here, watch my round-off. Hey, kiddo, be a sport. Take the pills out of my pocket and put one under my tongue.

Peter:
 I don't get it, Lois. Baseball's always been the secret to male bonding. It even worked for Rosie O'Donnell and his father in A League of Their Own.

Lois:
 Peter, I hate to say this, but it doesn't seem like your dad is interested in bonding with you. All he cares about is work.

Peter:
 Wait a second. Work! That's what'll bring us together. We can start our own father-son business.

Francis:
 What are you doing with all them bathtubs, you heathen dummy?

Peter:
 Pop, why you gotta be like that? We cut 'em in half, stick a Virgin Mary in them and sell them as shrines.

Francis:
 That's my boy. At least, that's what your mama always told me. Now give me a hug before I give you a knuckle sammich.

Lois:
 Or, you could just get your father a job with you at the toy factory.

Peter:
 That's an even better idea! Lois, you're a genius. Now give me a hug before I give you a knuckle sandwich.

Lois:
 Peter, I can't hug you. Cut it out. I'm serious.

Peter:
 And this is the nerve center of the whole factory, my station. I assemble our new action figure, Zeke, the moody drifter.

Francis:
 You mean to tell me you stand here all day playing with dolls?

Peter:
 Dad, it's not easy. See, I gotta twist on his head and stick a tiny pack of smokes in his torn denim jacket.

Doll:
 [Coughing] Any of you kids want to see a dead body?

Peter:
 Ooh. Wait here, Dad. Hey, Mr. Weed?

Peter:
 Listen, I was wondering if you might have a job for my dad.

 Weed:
 Your father? He must be a man of at least 70.

Peter:
 Oh, yeah. But he's in great shape. Except his prostate. At 2:00 a.m. last night, I thought a horse was using the bathroom.

Francis:
 Peter! All finished. What's next?

Peter:
 Oh, Dad, you did my whole day's work in five minutes. We should sell you to the circus, you freak!

 Weed:
 I've never seen such productivity. How is this possible?

Peter:
 I'll tell you how it's possible. Because this man always put his job before everything else. His wife, his health, even his own son. Especially his own son.

 Weed:
 I need hear no more. Everyone, this is your new shop foreman. Welcome aboard, sir. Lead as you see fit.

Peter:
 Dad, after all these years, you and me together, side by side, father and son, uh?.

Francis:
 Peter, this is truly a miracle. I'm so grateful.

Peter:
 Hold that thought. Hey, boys, you're on.

Peter:
 Go ahead, Dad.

Francis:
 Thank you, Jesus. I have a purpose in life again. Hey! Break up the sewing circle and get back to work!

Stewie:
 My, my. What a thumping good read! Lions eating Christians, people nailing each other to two-by-fours. I

Chris:
 Please don't say "pooh."

Lois:
 Peter! Are you all right? Where's your father?

Peter:
 Still at the factory. He's turning the break room into a chapel.

Lois:
 A chapel? Where will you all eat lunch?

Peter:
 Lois, lunch is a sin. Taking a break is a sin. Bestiality is a sin. I'm not sure how that came up

Man:
 Hey, Peter, your dad stinks. I'm working triple shifts, and I'm still not Employee of the Week. How am I supposed to compete with that?

Peter:
 Hey, where is he anyway?

Jesus:
 This'll be for my fourth birdie. Looks like someone's in the zone.

Man:
 Oh, tough break there, Jesus.

Jesus:
 Yup. Or was it? Oop, oop, oop. Boo-yah!

Francis:
 Back to work, all of you! What's going on here?

Peter:
 Uh, Dad, some of the guys think that, well .since you took over, work is no fun.

Francis:
 Work's not supposed to be fun.

Peter:
 Well, why not?

Francis:
 Why not? Why not? That's Satan talking! You're a failure as a worker and as a father!

Peter:
 Now wait a minute. I may not be perfect, but at least I love my kids enough not to spend every minute of the day working! I'm a damn good father, and that's more than I can say about you!

Francis:
 [Gasping] Peter, you've never spoken to me like that before. You're fired!

Peter:
 Well, in that case, I'm suing you for sexual harassment. I'll see you at home.

Francis:
 What do you think you're doing, lad?

Chris:
 Nothing!

Francis:
 Something's wrong with your shower. The water's not cold enough. I like me showers colder than a well digger's kerblocken.

Lois:
 I think it's time someone sits his kerfluffin down and has a talk with his unemployed son.

Francis:
 If Peter needs to talk, he'd best go to confession to beg forgiveness for all his failings! Have a glorious day.

Lois:
 Peter, how can you just sit there and let him talk like that?

Peter:
 He's right, Lois. I am no good. Even my own dad doesn't love me. Face it. I'm going to Hell.

Peter:
 Wow. Adolf Hitler, Al Capone, John Wilkes Booth. Hey, what are you doing here?

Superman:
 I killed a hooker. She made a crack about me being faster than a speeding bullet, so I ripped her in half like a phone book.

Stewie:
 Yes, the fat man's going to Hell. And from the looks of his midsection, he'll burn like a tire dump for all eternity. Oh! I love God! He's so deliciously evil.

Lois:
 Stewie, eat your oatmeal. Honey, you're a wonderful husband, a loving father, and, for some reason I'll never understand, a very devoted son.

Peter:
 That's a nice thought, Lois, but sadly, it means nothing coming from you.

Tom Tucker:
 Well, the moment has arrived at last. We now go live to Logan International Airport where the Pope's plane has just touched down.

Emcee:
 Hello, Boston! Are you ready to humble yourself before God?

Emcee:
 What? Have you all taken a vow of silence? Come on!

Emcee:
 Then put your hands together for the one, the only His Holiness, the Pope!

Peter:
 Hey, I just got a crazy idea! Augh! Why? Why? Why? Hey, I just got another crazy idea!

Peter:
 Room service!

Manager:
 We didn't order no room service.

Peter:
 Actually I just wanted to check the honor bar. 'Cause uh, the last Pope we had here filled his shaving kit with Necco wafers.

Manager:
 All right, wise guy, who are you?

Peter:
 I'm just a faithful Catholic man with a family crisis only His Holiness can resolve. I've never asked the church for anything, but I don't know where else to turn.

Peter:
 Augh!

Driver:
 My heavens, son! Are you okay?

Peter:
 Yeah. I just got bounced by the Pope's road crew.

Driver:
 It's good you missed me. I'm set to drive the Popemobile, and any slight bump on the head knocks me unconscious for a few hours. I always wake up feeling fine, but it's just so darn inconvenient to be knocked out that easily. Even by the slightest tap. Like this.

Luke:
 Taking it off here, Boss.

Sheriff:
 Take it off there, Luke.

Dragline:
 Wiping it off, Boss.

Sheriff:
 Wipe it off, there, Dragline.

Luke:
 Waving at the Pope here, Boss.

Sheriff:
 Wave at the Pope there, Luke.

The Pope:
 Are you sure this is Boston?

Peter:
 Yeah, it's Boston. See, look, there's Harvard.

The Pope:
 That's just a barn.

Peter:
 Ooh, someone went to Yale.

Peter:
 Lois, put the coffee on.

Lois:
 Careful. I just cleaned the floor.

Peter:
 Good thing, huh?.

The Pope:
 Mmmm, lemony.

Lois:
 Your Holiness, this is such an honor. Please, go into the living room, and make yourself at home! Peter, what is the Pope doing here?

Peter:
 Relax, honey. I just hijacked his bubble car so he can convince my dad I'm a good guy.

Lois:
 You kidnapped the Pope? Peter, this is the most reckless thing you've ever done!

Peter:
 Come on, Lois. What about the time I was on that airplane?

Peter:
 [Giggling]

The Pope:
 Peter, you've raised a fine family.

Peter:
 Yeah, well, my dad thinks I'm a screw-up. Matter of fact, I was hoping you could change his mind. He'd have to believe you. You're God's go-to guy.

The Pope:
 Well, your father is entitled to his opinion. But more important is what you think. Look deep in your heart, my son. Do you think you're a screw-up?

Peter:
 No. I'm not. You know what? I'm a damn good father. And I have great kids.

Meg:
 That's not what Grandpa says.

Peter:
 Well, Grandpa is wrong. Meg, it's not a sin for a girl your age to like boys.

Meg:
 Thanks, Daddy.

Peter:
 And Chris, what you do in the bathroom is between you and God. And if you're sorry, he'll forgive you.

Chris:
 Thanks, Dad!

Lois:
 Good for you, Peter. But isn't there someone else you should speak to?

Peter:
 Yes, there is. Scarecrow, you've had brains all along. Same goes for your heart, Tin Man. And Kristy McNichol, come back to television. We miss you.

Lois:
 I meant you should talk to your father.

Peter:
 You're right. You with me, big guy?

The Pope:
 Peter, I go where I am needed.

Peter:
 To the Popemobile!

Workers:
 [Desperate muttering]

Peter:
 Remember when we brought in that stripper for Lombardi's birthday and it turned out to be his son? I think this is gonna top it.

Man:
 Wow, it's the Pope!

Francis:
 Slothful sinners! You're here to work, not sit around with your.... Holy Mother! It's the Holy Father. I am not worthy.

The Pope:
 Rise, my son. You are indeed worthy, for you have raised a fine son. His zest for life is an affirmation

Peter:
 Wow! And that's from the freakin' Pope! So I guess you were wrong about me, huh, Dad?

Francis:
 I was wrong all right.

Peter:
 Stand by, boys.

Francis:
 I was wrong about you! You've gone soft on me, Holy Father! Even a tambourine-shaking Baptist could tell this boy's no good!

The Pope:
 Are you calling me a liar?

Peter:
 Whoah, easy, Pontiff.

The Pope:
 Because I'll excommunicate your sorry...

Peter:
 Okay, time out.

The Pope:
 Oh! I have never met such an infuriating man! You must have the patience of a saint.

Peter:
 Well, he's my dad. And I just want him to love me.

Francis:
 Peter, how could you say such a thing? I love you with all me heart.

Peter:
 You do?

Francis:
 Of course. I just don't like you. I don't like anything about you!

Peter:
 Keep playing, you guys. I think this is as good as its going to get. Dad, to be honest, I don't like you, either. Aw, jeez, that's a terrible thing to say. I guess I am going to Hell.

The Pope:
 Peter, the good Lord said to honor thy father. He never said anything about liking him.

Peter:
 Well, in that case, Dad, I'm gonna eat meat on Fridays, golf on Sundays, laugh at Jewish comedians, and yes, sleep with my Protestant wife. But I won't enjoy it. And she hates it.

Francis:
 Well, fine. I'll be on me way. Take back your job, and give your old man a hug.

Peter:
 I love you, Dad.

Francis:
 I know you do, son.

Peter:
 What are you gonna do now?

Francis:
 I don't know. I guess the good Lord doesn't have much use for an old man like me.

The Pope:
 Well...I suppose I could use another pair of hands on my tour.

Peter:
 You'd give Dad a job, even knowing what a jerk he is?

The Pope:
 I have to. As you said, Peter, "I am the freakin' Pope."

Francis:
 All right, get back! No flash photography, or you'll go straight to Hell! You! You're in God's house, you heathen! Take that cap off before I take it off for you!

Lois:
 Well, I think your father found the perfect job.

Peter:
 Let's hope so. I love being a good father. But I don't want to have to be a good son again for a long, long time.

s Mom:
 Peter, open the door, and break out the schnapps! Guess who needs a place to sleep it off for the weekend?

Peter:
 Mom!?

Brian:
 Oh, my God, no!

Peter:
 Quick, everyone! Into the pod!

Diane Simmons:
 And that concludes our special half-hour salute to the past 1,000 years.

Tom Tucker:
 We leave you this New Year's Eve with a look back at some of those we've lost this millennium.

Meg:
 Kevin asked me to Quagmire's millennium party! I am so psyched!

Peter:
 There's nothing like a party at someone else's house. You never have to worry about cleaning.

Peter:
 [Chanting conga music]

Chicken mascot:
 well, looks like someone's going to a big party tonight. You should pick up a chicken-strip party pack for all your friends. Here's a coupon.

Peter:
 Whoa, whoa, look, pal. I don't take coupons from giant chickens. Not after last time.

Peter:
 Oh, yeah. And that nice chicken outside gave me this coupon.

Clerk:
 I'm sorry. This has expired.

Peter:
 You son of a...

Peter:
 [panting] Chicken gave me a bad coupon.

Peter:
 Some other time, pal.

Chicken Mascot:
 There won't be any other time. The world is gonna end at midnight tonight! Y2K!

Peter:
 Y2K? What are you selling? Chicken or sex jelly?

Chicken Mascot:
 Haven't you heard? At midnight, every computer in the world is gonna fail! Planes will fall out of the sky, and all the world's nuclear weapons will explode, annihilating the entire planet!

Peter:
 No! Silly rabbit! Trix are for kids. Damn long-ears, trying to take Easter away from Jesus. Sorry. What were you saying?

Cleveland:
 Hey, Peter, in case you didn't know, a balloon tied to a mailbox is the international symbol for "party over here"!

Peter:
 Forget the party. The world's gonna end! Y2K! I heard it from a chicken-man.

Cleveland:
 Oh, Peter, you are the height of just-too-mucherie.

Peter:
 Well, laugh all you want. But when you die, you'll have to go to heaven. And you know what? You know what? I bet you run into those two dead bailiff ladies from Night Court. You're not gonna know which one is which. And it's going to be really awkward. So bite me.

Brian:
 Hey, can you help me with these damn studs?

Lois:
 Aren't you a little over-dressed?

Brian:
 Oh, well, actually, I'm just stopping off at Quagmire's. There's a benefit gala at the Boston Pops tonight, and...well, I'm trying to nail the flautist.

Lois:
 Oh, Stewie! You're adorable!

Stewie:
 Yes, yes. I rather like the sash. But do the Huggies make my ass look big?

Lois:
 Peter, come on! You've had 1,000 years to get ready for this party. It always takes him so long to get dressed.

Lois:
 Peter, we're gonna be late for my cousin's wedding. Aren't you dressed yet?

Peter:
 Oh, crap. Well, one of us is gonna have to change. (Pause.) [sighs] Unzip me.

Lois:
 Where's your father?

Meg:
 He's still down in the basement.

Lois:
 Peter, you've been down there all day. I hope you're already... [screams]

Chris:
 Oh, my God! The government is here! Run, ET, run!

ET:
 [Screaming]

Peter:
 The end of the world is coming. Now, come on, get in your radiation suits.

Lois:
 Peter, we are not missing a once-in-a-lifetime event because of some wacko doomsday theory.

Peter:
 Okay. Okay. Hey, guys. You know that one Christmas present you really wanted, but didn't get?

Meg:
 A phone?

Chris:
 A pony?

Brian:
 A humidor?

Stewie:
 A dead Lois?

Peter:
 Yeah. Well, it's in the basement. Come on. Let's go see.

Meg:
 My own phone!

Chris:
 I'm gonna name him Sparky.

Lois:
 Peter, if you want to stay here, that's fine. But we're going to the party. Kids!

Peter:
 Honey, are you pregnant?

Stewie:
 Oh, dear me, yes, yes. This is how I wanted to enter the new millennium. Locked in a basement with imbeciles dressed like a gay Neil Armstrong.

Brian:
 Thanks a lot, Peter. Right now, I could be in Boston, pretending I give a rat's ass about Vivaldi.

Meg:
 Yeah, and I could be getting felt up by Kevin.

Lois:
 Now, Meg, don't you give it all away up front. Make him work for it. And shame on you, Peter. Scaring the kids with your nuclear-holocaust nonsense.

Peter:
 You said "nuclear." It's "nucular," dummy. The "s" is silent.

Chris:
 It's almost midnight.

Diane Simmons:
 We now go live to Asian reporter, Tricia Takanawa. Tricia, what can you tell us?

Tricia Takanawa:
 Diane, Quahog's fabled alabaster clam is about to descend and usher in a new millennium.

Crowd:
 10, 9, 8...

Peter:
 This is it!

Crowd:
 6, 5, 4...

Peter:
 Hold on tight!

Crowd:
 3, 2, 1. Happy New Year!

Brian:
 A flautist, Peter!

Lois:
 Well, I hope you're happy. Come on, kids. We can still make the party if we...

Military Guy:
 Nice work, Lieutenant. Very festive.

Lieutenant:
 Actually, sir, each of those lights represents a missile launching by itself. The pattern is just a coincidence.

Military Guy:
 Oh, well, now that you mention it, the "Y" is a little misshapen. Still, it's pretty amazing.

Bill Clinton:
 Oh, what the hell. Come here, Hillary.

Alien abductee:
 What did I miss?

Peter:
 Holy crap! Anybody else feel that?

Peter:
 Good morning, family. Hey, Lois, you remember when I was the third Hardy Boy?

Lois:
 Peter, there was no third Hardy Boy.

Peter:
 Oh, really? Just like there was no apocalypse? He shoots! He scores!

Lois:
 Okay, we were wrong about the end of the world, and you were right. Can we please just drop it?

Meg:
 It's just not fair. I finally get a date with Kevin, and he gets vaporized!

Chris:
 He's just using that as an excuse. [Laughs]

Lois:
 Let's just be grateful we survived the apocalypse healthy and mutation-free.

Cleveland:
 I said I can do it.

Quagmire:
 Hey, shut up!

Peter:
 Hey, Clevemire.

Quagmire:
 That's "Quagland."

Cleveland:
 "Quagland?" Oh, you must be dreaming.

Quagmire:
 Not about kicking your fat ass!

Lois:
 Boys, please. You used to be so close.

Cleveland:
 Sorry, Lois. We're both a little crabby, on account of the fact that neither one of us has had any food since we got fused together.

Lois:
 Well, we just finished off what was left in the kitchen. When I think of all the food we've wasted in this house...

Peter:
 Here, Tom Selleck. Come on. Down the hatch. Come on. Hey! Hey! None for you, Higgins! Trying to steal Tom Selleck's food! No. No! You've had yours!

Lois:
 Thank goodness Peter bought a supply of dehydrated meals before the blast. Peter, what are you doing? You just ate a year's worth of food!

Peter:
 What a waste of money. I'm still hungry.

Peter:
 Everyone leave. I have to poop. Now!

Brian:
 Well, so much for finding food at the Stop 'N Shop.

Peter:
 Figures. The one time I remember my Value Club Card.

Brian:
 Wait a minute. I smell barbecue.

Tom Tucker:
 So what do you think, Diane? Can I cook, or what?

Diane Simmons:
 Mmm, delicious, Tom. I guess we should be eating her with chopsticks.

Brian:
 Oh, my God! They're eating Asian reporter, Trisha Takanawa.

Peter:
 That's crazy. They're just gonna be hungry again in an hour.

Chris:
 Come on, Woody. We're gonna search for food.

Peter:
 Sorry, Chris. The plant can't come.

Lois:
 It's his best friend.

Peter:
 Lois, it'll just be another mouth to feed. I'll take care of Woody, son.

Chris:
 What was that?

Peter:
 Nothing. Let's go.

Lois:
 Go where? If there's no food in Quahog what makes you think there's gonna be food anywhere else?

Peter:
 Lois, everyone knows there are only two things that can survive a "nucular" holocaust cockroaches and Twinkies. And there's a Twinkie factory in Natick.

Lois:
 Twinkies?

Peter:
 Yeah. I saw a story about them on A&E.

Announcer:
 And now back to A&E's Biography, "Twinkie the Kid."

Greg Twinkee:
 [stammering] It was difficult for Twink to play with other children. He was different. He was definitely... He had no bones. And he couldn't really play any sports.

Sheila Twinkee:
 Yeah. That's why, you know, we got him the lasso.

Greg Twinkee:
 Yeah.

Sheila Twinkee:
 He'd spend hours in the backyard, playing Wonder Woman. [Laughing] He's gonna kill me.

Greg Twinkee:
 He loved that lasso. Not as much as the baton. But we put a stop to the baton. He was different enough, you know?

Peter:
 We just gotta get to that Twinkie factory, and we'll have all the food we need.

Lois:
 Well, good-bye, sweet home. Maybe someday we'll return.

Peter:
 Hey, Joe, can you keep an eye on the place?

Joe:
 I might as well. I'm melted to the ground.

Meg:
 There you go, Mr. Swanson. These oughta keep the rats away.

Joe:
 Thanks, hon. Stay in school!

Mutant Rat:
 [Roaring]

Joe Swanson:
 Bring it on!

Lois:
 Look, Peter! People!

Jorad:
 Halt!

Jorad:
 I am Jorad. I and my band of highway warriors control this territory. Do you have any food?

Peter:
 Uh, no. That's why we're on the road.

Jorad:
 Then you may not pass until you answer the following question. Name something you take on a picnic.

Meg:
 Blankets.

Brian:
 Potato salad.

Chris:
 Chicken.

Stewie:
 A dead Lois.

Peter:
 Okay. We're gonna go with potato salad.

Jorad:
 Show me "potato salad"!

Peter:
 [Whispering] Maybe we should go now.

Peter:
 Aw, jeez! Out of gas?

Chris:
 Hey, Dad, look!

Old Man:
 Well, howdy, strangers. You look plumb tuckered. Like to sit a spell?

Lois:
 Actually, we are tired.

Chris:
 And hungry.

Old Man:
 Well, we got plenty of room here and all the fresh apples you can eat.

Lois:
 Oh, Peter! We found a new home!

Peter:
 What are you talkin' about? We're going to Natick!

Meg:
 For what? A Twinkie factory that might not even exist anymore?

Brian:
 She's right. Besides, this place is paradise.

Old Man:
 Sure is. Except for Randy Newman.

Peter:
 Randy Newman?

Old Man:
 Yup. Just sits there all night and day singing about what he sees.

Randy Newman:
 ? Fat man with his kids and dog? ?Drove in through the mornin' fog? ?Hey there, Rover, come on over ?

Lois:
 Well, it's nice to have music while we eat.

Randy:
 ? Red-headed lady, reachin' for an apple? ?Gonna take a bite, nope, nope? ?She's gonna breathe on it first? ?Wipes it on her blouse...? ?She takes a bite, chews it once,? ?Twice, three times, four times, stops? ?Saliva workin'? ?She takes a long hard look at Randy? ?Five times? ?Fat old husband walkin over ?

Lois:
 Let's get the hell out of here.

Randy:
 ?Yeah, they're walkin' down the road? ?Left foot,right foot,left foot,right foot,left-- ?

Chris:
 ? Left foot, right foot? ?Left foot, right foot?

Lois:
 Please, Chris, Mommy's going to have a big...

Chris:
 ?Left foot, right foot? ?Left foot... ?

Lois:
 Chris please... Stop it! Thank you sweetie. Now, Peter, we've got to find some food.

Brian:
 Oh, my God! Look!

Peter:
 It's Natick.

All:
 [Cheering]

Meg:
 There's no factory?

Stewie:
 Ha! Very good, fat man! We follow the Pied Piper of Hamsteak to the gates of oblivion, and look what it's brought us! We're finished! We're done! Game over, man! Game over! Augh! Damn it!

Lois:
 Stewie, get out of that nuclear waste! Who knows what animals have been in there?

Stewie:
 It's about damn time!

Peter:
 No words...should have sent a poet.

Brian:
 There's enough food to last us forever!

Lois:
 Peter, we're saved! You were right. We can settle down here and build a house, just like we had in Quahog.

Meg:
 Yeah! And we can build a mall, so I'll have a place to hang out!

Chris:
 And two Denny's, so we can always say, "Let's not go to that one. Let's go to the good one."

Lois:
 We can have Quagland get Joe out of the driveway. And we can build a community, just like the one we had.

Peter:
 No! We'll build a better one. I hereby proclaim this city New Quahog!

Stewie:
 Well. This isn't very good, now, is it?

Quagmire:
 [screaming]

Chris:
 Guess who?

Meg:
 Stop it, Chris.

Chris:
 Wrong! Ha ha ha ha! Oh, wait. Did you say "Chris"?

Lois:
 Stewie, time for breakfast! Did you wash your tentacles, my big handsome boy?

Stewie:
 What the devil are you talking about? "Handsome." I'm repugnant! I'm a radio-bloody-active freak!

Quagmire:
 Eh, I fold. Come on, let's go home and get tender with your wife.

Cleveland:
 I don't know, Quagmire. Lovemaking with Loretta has somehow lost its intimacy.

Quagmire:
 All right!

Brian:
 Ah, excuse me, Mr. Mayor. We have an outsider who wishes to join our community.

Peter:
 Welcome to my fair city! If you want to become a citizen, you have to get a job.

Man:
 Well, before the disaster, I was a physician.

Cleveland:
 That's terrific. We need a doctor.

Peter:
 We sure do. Let's hope you get it. Now pick a job out of the hat. Ah, "Village idiot." That's a good one. On Tuesdays, you get to wave your penis at traffic. Congratulations.

Joe:
 Peter, maybe we should've just let him be a doctor.

Peter:
 No! These are the rules of New Quahog. Besides, that's how everyone else got their jobs.

Old lady:
 Go! [Frantic screaming]

Patient:
 You see, Doc, my back tooth is killing me. [screaming]

Peter:
 And things have worked out fine so far.

Cleveland:
 Peter, no offense, but that's because we all pitched in.

Joe:
 That's right. We built schools, and hospitals.

Brian:
 Yeah, not to mention the theater.

Brian:
 "But when I saw the movie, it looked like Audrey Hepburn not only didn't have breakfast at Tiffany's, she hadn't eaten anything in a year. [hooting] I am such a bitch!"

Brian:
 We have everything we need. And no crime, no guns, no pollution.

Peter:
 Brian's right. We've left ourselves defenseless. Guys, we need to make some guns.

Cleveland:
 Guns? Guns only lead to trouble.

Peter:
 Right. And when that trouble happens, we'll be ready to blow its freakin' head off! Besides, without guns how would our forefathers have settled their differences?

Forefather:
 8, 9, 10, and turn!

Lois:
 Honey, Mommy's making you some new feetie pajamas. And look, it has a little trap door for when you gotta make inky.

Stewie:
 I'll show you inky!

Lois:
 Let's see if they fit, mmm?

Stewie:
 Never! [Mocking laughter] Look at me! I'm Fred Astaire! Ah!

Lois:
 Gotcha. Oh, you are getting heavy. I'll gonna have your father flood the basement so you can get some more exercise.

Stewie:
 Yes, yes, I do seem to have gained a bit of girth. Actually, my gullet seems to be rumbling. [Grunting] There we are. Oh, I say. I've laid an egg! Well, that wasn't so bad. I don't know what these women are always complaining about... Augh!

Peter:
 Attention, New Quahogians. Today my vision for our future comes true. A chicken in every pot, and a cap in every ass!

Lois:
 Peter, put that away! Where did you get the metal for all those guns?

Peter:
 Recycling. I used the pipes from our irrigation system.

Woman:
 Are you crazy? You destroyed all our water pipes?

Peter:
 There's a reason I'm in charge here, all right? I knew the world was gonna end. I'm the one who found the Twinkie factory and started this town. And I'm the one who gave elocution lessons to Rosie Perez.

Peter:
 [Imitating Rosie Perez] Don't be stupid! She speak good and everything!

Crowd:
 Let's get him! Throw him out!

Lois:
 Wait! We can work this out!

Peter:
 Jeez, I haven't been thrown out of any place since I was a counselor at the bulimia clinic.

Peter:
 Aw, man, did anybody else throw up after eating that fish last night?

Stewie:
 Victory is ours.

Peter:
 Honey, I'm sorry I got us kicked out of New Quahog. I guess nobody really needs guns. I'm not always right, after all.

Lois:
 Oh, Peter. Hearing you say that almost makes it worth having the world blown up.

Meg:
 Where are we gonna go?

Peter:
 I hear there's a Carvel factory in Framingham.

Chris:
 All right! Fudgie the Whale! And Cookie Puss! And Cookie O'Puss! And Nutty the Chocolate Ghost!

Lois:
 Come on, everybody. Let's sing a song.

Chris:
 ? Left foot, right foot?

All:
 ?left foot, right foot?

Pam:
 Bobby!

Bobby:
 Good morning.

Pam:
 Oh, Bobby. I just had the weirdest dream. I dreamt I saw the strangest episode of Family Guy. And there was a giant chicken! And Stewie was an octopus.

Bobby:
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on now. It's all right. Everything's gonna be okay. What's Family Guy?

 Rogers:
 Hello, neighbor. I'm glad we're together again.

 Rogers:
 Oh! I think I hear our friend Trolley.

Stewie:
 Actually, it's your mortal enemy, Stewie.

 Rogers:
 What the...

Stewie:
 I wouldn't bother visiting the Neighborhood of Make-believe today, Mr. Rogers. I dare say, you'll find it quite in ruin.

 Rogers:
 What?

Henrietta Pussycat:
 Meow, meow, meow, skin graft. Meow, meow, meow, meow.

 Rogers:
 Oh, my God!

Stewie:
 That's right, all dead. And now, Mr. Rogers...Fred. May as well drop the bloody formalities, I'm going to kill you anyway.

 Rogers:
 No, please. Don't!

Stewie:
 How ironic. "Rogers." It almost rhymes with: "eliminate."

 Rogers:
 No!

Stewie:
 What, what? What the devil?

Lois:
 It's okay, Stewie. You were just talking in your sleep.

 Rogers:
 But now it's time for you to meet Mr. Death.

Stewie:
 Aaugh!

George Jetson:
 Help! Jane! Stop this crazy thing! Stop! Help!

Jane Jetson:
 Oh, my God! George!

George Jetson:
 Did you not hear me out there?

Elroy Jetson:
 Dad, are you...

George Jetson:
 Go to your room, Elroy.

Elroy Jetson:
 But what happened?

George Jetson:
 Go to your room! For 45 minutes I was out there screaming. I know that because my damn watch is broken.

Jane Jetson:
 I'm sorry.

George Jetson:
 Oh, "I'm sorry!" "I'm sorry!" Jane is sorry! I could've been killed!

Chris:
 So, uh, what are you wearing? Wow! I bet you could see right through that.

Lois:
 Chris, who are you talking to?

Chris:
 Grandma.

Brian:
 What is it?

Lois:
 It looks like Stewie had an accident on the carpet.

Brian:
 Oh, Lois, again?

Lois:
 That baby just does not want to keep his diaper on.

Stewie:
 Here you are! What the hell is this?

Lois:
 Sweetie, that's tuna salad.

Stewie:
 Oh, is that what it is? Really? Because I could have sworn it was mayonnaise and cat food! Here's 50 cents. Do me a favor, sweetheart. The next time you're out shopping, why don't you splurge on a tin of solid white albacore?

Lois:
 Stewie, are you upset because you went wee-wee on the carpet?

Stewie:
 What did you just say?

Peter:
 Hey, Lois, I...hey, did you pee in here?

Stewie:
 In a moment! What did you just say?

Lois:
 Peter, we have a serious problem we need to discuss.

Peter:
 Aw, jeez. This isn't another one of those interventions, is it?

Lois:
 Peter, you've been wearing that giant foam cowboy hat for eight months now. Please, for your family, take it off.

Peter:
 Hey. Hey, I can take this hat off anytime I want. I just don't want to. Get away!

Lois:
 No, it's Stewie. He peed on the carpet.

Peter:
 Do I-do I hit him?

Stewie:
 Bend down, Mother.

Lois:
 Yes, honey?

Stewie:
 How dare you sully my good name by spreading your slanderous filth!

Lois:
 Stewie, no hitting! Use your words.

Brian:
 Oh, he's probably just ashamed, Lois. You're just a helpless little carpet tinkler, aren't you?

Stewie:
 Well! The outrages I have suffered today will not be soon forgotten! I will not be forgetting those outrages! No, no! No, they won't be forgotten! Not the...

Brian:
 "Outrages," yeah. I think we got it.

Stewie:
 Ah!

Lois:
 Maybe it's time for Stewie to start potty training.

Peter:
 Isn't he a little young for that? You know what happened to the Lindbergh baby.

 Lindbergh:
 Charles, he's only 6 months old.

Charles Lindbergh:
 Honey, would you relax? God, I flew across the Atlantic by myself. I'm a national treasure, for God's sake. I think I know how to...ah! Oh, God! Oh, God! All right. He was kidnapped. You call the police. I'll write the ransom note.

 Lindbergh:
 What about Amelia? She saw everything!

Charles Lindbergh:
 You leave her to me.

Lois:
 Come on, honey. He's been having accidents. Maybe he's trying to tell us he's ready. This could be a nice way for you and Stewie to bond.

Peter:
 Bond? James Bond. All right, Lois. I'll do it!

Brian:
 Oh, God. Not again, Brian. Why can't you stop peeing on the carpet? Damn it! It's not coming out.

Lois:
 Brian, is that you?

Brian:
 Uh, yeah. It's me.

Lois:
 Is everything okay?

Brian:
 Yeah, yeah. I couldn't sleep. I'll be up in a minute.

Lois:
 Okay.

Brian:
 [disgusted sigh]

Bob Barker:
 Join us tomorrow for more Price is Right. This is Bob Barker reminding you to help control the pet population. Have your pets spayed or neutered.

Brian:
 Oh, just die, already.

Meg:
 Mom, Stewie peed on the rug again!

Brian:
 No!

Lois:
 Oh, this has gotta stop.

Meg:
 God! It smells gross.

Brian:
 well, Princess, I don't see anyone dabbing yours behind their ears.

Lois:
 That's odd. It looks like someone already tried to clean it up.

Brian:
 No, it doesn't.

Chris:
 Mine smells like soda.

Peter:
 Yeah, I'm looking for toilet-training books.

Clerk:
 Oh, yes. We can help you there. "Everybody Poops" is still the standard, of course. We've also got the less popular "Nobody Poops But You."

Peter:
 Huh. Well, see, we're Catholic, so...

Clerk:
 Then you want "You're a Naughty Child And That's Concentrated Evil Coming Out the Back of You."

Peter:
 Perfect!

Lois:
 Brian, what are you doing?

Brian:
 Oh, hi, Lois. I was just washing some things.

Lois:
 Those look like our sheets and our quilt.

Brian:
 They are. I'm washing them in some fabric softener, because last night they were so itchy, I couldn't sleep. Which is why I was downstairs when you asked me if everything was okay and I said I couldn't sleep. You know, because it was so itchy.

Peter:
 Come on, Stewie. Don't you want to pee in a toilet bowl, like a big boy? I remember when I learned to use a potty all by myself. I was so proud.

Peter:
 Hey, Lois! I did it!

Stewie:
 Well, perhaps I could give it the old college try. Why don't you put your hands right there? It'll help me relax.

Peter:
 Okay, buddy. Augh! Maybe you don't have to pee. Hey, I oughta give you beer. It goes right through you.

Stewie:
 Wonderful, and while we're at it, we could light up a doobie and watch porn.

Peter:
 Y-yeah?

Stewie:
 Listen, you, I'll use these facilities when I'm damn well ready. Until then, you shall continue to sanitize my crevasse and be damn grateful for the opportunity! Starting right...[grunting]. Well not now. But soon!

Peter:
 Oh, oh, and I want these, and these, and these.

Lois:
 Only one.

Peter:
 But that man over there got two!

Lois:
 Peter, I don't care what the other men are getting. You're only getting one.

Peter:
 I hate you! Hey, what's that sound?

Stewie:
 You're urinating! So, it's been you all along! Oh, this is too perfect! I've been taking the blame for Rex.

Meg:
 Ew, it's everywhere!

Lois:
 It's okay. Meg, hand me my sweater.

Peter:
 Jeez, Brian, where do you think you are? Payless?

Stewie:
 I say, I say, Paco, grab a mop. For God's sake, could somebody get Patches the hell out of here before he decides to bend a fresh biscuit on the conveyor belt?

Lois:
 It's okay. We'll meet you in the parking lot.

Brian:
 Oh, God, Lois. I need help.

Brian:
 Look, I really don't even know why I'm here. The urologist said I was fine.

Brian:
 Doubt that! I mean, I've got a very comfortable life. I live with a great family. All my needs are met. Okay, look. So, maybe this isn't where I thought I was gonna be at 7 years old. It's just that I.... God, is it okay if I smoke in here? Thanks. It's just that things don't always work out the way we plan. Do you know I've never been to Europe? Now look at me. Middle-aged, alone, and peeing in supermarkets. Man, didn't see that coming. I had this dream last night. Did you ever see Logan's Run?

Intercom:
 Last day. Capricorn 2537. Our next dedication goes out to Tommy from Kim.

Man:
 We've got a runner in Sector G.

Brian:
 What about him? He's gotta be in his 50s.

Brian:
 So what do you think?

 Kaplan:
 I think you're very sensitive, and you put up a tough front. I think you're in pain.

Brian:
 Damn it, Brian, do not cry.

 Kaplan:
 I'd like to pet you, Brian. Would that be okay? You're a good dog, Brian. A very good...

Brian:
 Keep it above the waist, Doc.

Tom Tucker:
 And now part two of our very own Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa's special report on sex.

Tricia Takanawa:
 Tom, I'm standing in the bedroom of Judy and Glen Isaacs. Ten years married and still in love. What's their secret? Judy has an inoperable brain tumor the size of my fist. And that just happens to be Glen's fetish.

Lois:
 Brian, how'd it go?

Brian:
 Well, Lois, I think I have little bit of "me work" to do. But I'm feeling things, and that's a start.

Lois:
 Oh, that's wonderful. You know, like most other people, I used to think therapy was only for crazies and nut jobs. Isn't that silly?

Peter:
 Hey, Lois, I...hey, Brian. How you doing? They let you out already?

Brian:
 I was in a therapy session, not a lunatic asylum.

Peter:
 Hey, hey, hey, calm down. Lots of crazy people have gone on to lead normal, successful lives.

Lois:
 What did your therapist say?

Brian:
 Dr. Kaplan thinks the "accidents" are linked to some kind of mid-life crisis. He suggests I go out into the world and pursue my dreams. I'm leaving tomorrow.

Parachutist:
 Whoops. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on, hang on. I gave you one of the ones with silverware in it. Take this one instead. That one's probably fine.

Brian:
 Beautiful.

Man:
 Augh!

Brian:
 Oh, my God! Are you Stephen King?

Man:
 No. I'm Dean Koontz.

Brian:
 Oh.

Man:
 [Gurgling]

Brian:
 But, you know, thanks to these sessions, I think I'm okay. Being out in the world, feeling my power, and no accidents! I've been dry for two weeks now.

 Kaplan:
 Mazel tov.

Brian:
 Well, good-bye, Dr. Kaplan. And thank you.

Tom Tucker:
 Look, I know Stacy isn't your mother but upside-down face or not, you have to respect her.

Brian:
 Hey, you're Tom Tucker...[yelps]

Jake Tucker:
 Hey!

Brian:
 Oh, God. That was rude. I apologize. Wow.

Stewie:
 [Urinating] ? I'm a little teapot short and stout? ?Here is my handle, here is my spout? ?When I get all steamed up, hear me shout? Lois, it looks as if Puddles has done it again! Goodness, he's wet everything. [laughter]

Brian:
 I-I swear, I don't even remember doing it. I don't understand this.

Lois:
 Now, Brian, we know you're not doing this on purpose. But maybe we should consider...crating.

Brian:
 Oh, God.

Peter:
 Or you could be an outside dog. Eh? Would you like that? Eh? Outside?

Brian:
 And how embarrassed was I when the word "crate" came up? I thought I was past this. I traveled the world, for God's sake. Do you know how much I spent?

 Kaplan:
 Well, obviously we haven't hit the real issue yet. Drop it. Tell me, Brian, the last accident you remember, did anything unusual happen that might've triggered it?

Brian:
 No, no. It was a normal day.

Peter:
 Oh, Catwoman.

Lois:
 Peter, no "Catwoman" today. I'm tired.

Peter:
 What's the matter? Is the mighty Catwoman afraid of a little Catwoman melting spray?

Lois:
 Peter, no.

Peter:
 Come on.

Lois:
 All right. Okay. Enough, Batman. I don't want...

Peter:
 Not so mighty now, are you, Catwoman?

Peter:
 Take that. I spit water on you.

Lois:
 Peter! Batman, I can't breathe! Peter! I'm using my special cat power to get Batman all wet.

Peter:
 Hey, knock it off.

Lois:
 [meowing]

Brian:
 You know, just the usual stuff. Wait a minute. All that running water. That's gotta be it!

 Kaplan:
 Mmm-hmm. Brian, tell me about Lois.

Brian:
 Lois. Well, she's a fantastic woman. She's compassionate and charming, attractive. Well, stunning, really. I guess you could say I really...

 Kaplan:
 Love her?

Brian:
 No, of course not! Me and Lois? That's sick! I mean, come on. She's my best friend's wife.

 Kaplan:
 Mmm-hmmm.

Brian:
 Look, I love Lois, but I'm not in love with her.

 Kaplan:
 Who are you trying to convince, Brian? Me or you?

Brian:
 Oh, Brian, Brian, what a mess. Don't get antsy. I got three minutes left.

Peter:
 So, what the hell, Brian? You cured yet? 'Cause, you know, I don't want to have to live in a house with plastic on the furniture like some Italian family.

Brian:
 My therapist thinks he's figured out what my problem is.

Peter:
 Oh, yeah? What does Sigmund "Fraud" think it is?

Brian:
 He thinks I'm in love.

Peter:
 Oh, my God! You can talk!

Brian:
 [lengthy pause] Never mind.

Peter:
 Well, does this girl love you back?

Brian:
 I can't imagine.

Peter:
 You gotta find out for sure. You don't want to spend your life wondering what could have been.

Waiter:
 Sir, I need a decision.

Peter:
 Uh, uh, salad. No, wait! Soup!

Peter:
 But it was too late. And to this day, I still lay awake at night wondering about the soup that got away.

Brian:
 Thanks, Peter. I'm gonna go find out how she feels.

Man:
 I've taken you for granted.

Peter:
 Oh, get a room!

Lois:
 Hey, you. The news is on.

Brian:
 Where is everybody?

Lois:
 Stewie's taking a nap, and Peter and the kids are out. Come sit with me.

Brian:
 O-okay. [shuddering]

Diane Simmons:
 And now part three of Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa's special report on sex.

Tricia Takanawa:
 Thank you, Diane. Sex. Some people have it anonymously. What kind of person would do that, you might ask? Well, I'm about to find out. I just picked up a complete stranger in a hotel bar and he's in the bathroom right now, possibly doing drugs. Watch as I have sex with this potentially dangerous man as we take you in-depth and undercover.

Quagmire:
 I've never had a Spanish chick before. O-lé!

Lois:
 It is so refreshing to see something other than violence on the news. Brian, your tail keeps hitting me.

Brian:
 If it's bothering you, I can stop.

Lois:
 No, it's okay. The breeze feels good. It's so warm in here. Ooh, that's better.

Brian:
 I'd take my sweater off, but I'm afraid it's attached to my skin. [awkward laughter] [to self:]Smooth.

Lois:
 Well, I'd better go start dinner.

Stewie:
 Well, well, well!

Brian:
 How long have you been there?

Stewie:
 I came along about the time you started pummeling her with your tail.

Brian:
 You shut up!

Stewie:
 You love her! Ha! Oh, this is so good, it just has to be fattening.

Brian:
 I said, shut up!

Stewie:
 Oh, by the way, nice rap. "I'd take my sweater off, but I'm afraid it's attached to my skin." Ha ha ha! Imbecile!

Meg:
 Then, Brittany and Amber were like, "Let's go to the mall." And I was like, "Okay, I'll go to the mall." But then Amber wasn't gonna go, so I went to the mall. And you're not gonna believe it-they both showed up!

Peter:
 Hold on. Meg, Meg. I'm sorry. That is a really boring story. I haven't been this bored since that stupid drive-in movie.

Peter:
 This sucks.

Brian:
 Lois, this pasta, better than Italy.

Lois:
 It's just my Noodle Caboodle. I did use a different brand of potato chips for the crust, though.

Brian:
 Your culinary prowess is surpassed only by your unfailing grace and the uncommon, sometimes haunting glow of sensuality that surrounds you.

Lois:
 It's just Noodle Caboodle.

Peter:
 Hey, what are these hard things?

Lois:
 M&Ms. I ran out of paprika.

Brian:
 [blows kiss] Magnificent.

Stewie:
 Up. Up. Stewie wants to go uppie!

Lois:
 You want me to pick you up, sweetie?

Stewie:
 Mmm, Momma's skin's so soft.

Lois:
 My goodness, you're affectionate tonight. Well, let me give my big boy a kiss.

Stewie:
 Another! Another! Yes! Momma has candy kisses!

Brian:
 All right, that's enough! I mean, would you all excuse me, please?

Lois:
 Stewie...did you unhook Mommy's bra?

Brian:
 Uh, hi.

Lois:
 Well, hello, Brian.

Brian:
 I think we should talk.

Lois:
 Sure.

Brian:
 Lois, did your heart ever want to ask something, but your head was too afraid of what the answer might be?

Lois:
 Oh. Oh, God. Sometimes it's best not to ask those questions. Sometimes we should cherish what we already have. Like a very special friendship, let's say like the one you and I share that someone like me wouldn't change for anything in the world.

Brian:
 Someone like me wouldn't change it for anything in the world either.

Lois:
 I'm glad.

Brian:
 Okay, just to be clear, we were talking about me being in love with you, and you rejecting me, right?

Lois:
 Yes.

Brian:
 Just making sure. Say we were both drunk, and we knew we wouldn't remember?

Lois:
 Well, I'd have to be really, really...no!

Brian:
 I tell you, Peter, I wish I'd taken this up years ago.

Peter:
 Yeah, you know, my great-great-great uncle, Angus Griffin, invented the game.

Angus Griffin:
 So, we're all clear on the rules then? No Jews and no blacks.

All:
 Aye!

Peter:
 Whoa, you're like the Arnold Palmer of golf.

Brian:
 Yeah, life is good. I'm seven years old, and if I play my cards right I've got another seven years ahead of me.

Peter:
 Hey, what ever happened to your lady friend?

Brian:
 We decided to stay good friends. I found out that there are different kinds of love, and ours was perfect the way it was.

Peter:
 So she dumped you, huh? Ah, the hell with her! She'll probably end up with some idiot. Serves her right. Damn. Damn. Damn. Damn. Mulligan. Damn.

Diane Simmons:
 Good evening. I'm Diane Simmons. A stunning development tonight, as O.J. Simpson is proven innocent. We have the identity of the real killer. But first...

Tom Tucker:
 It's fall! The time of year when the leaves turn that pretty, purpley-orange and Quahog prepares for its annual Harvest Festival Parade.

Diane Simmons:
 Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa joins us live from the ceremony where they're choosing this year's theme.

Tricia Takanawa:
 Diane, behind me are 1,000 beautiful doves. Gently tied to each of their delicate legs is a parade theme suggested by ordinary citizens of Quahog. And here to pick this year's winning theme is "Ten Commandments" star, Charlton Heston.

Charlton Heston:
 Let my pigeons go!

Tricia Takanawa:
 He nailed one! We have our theme!

Cleveland:
 I submitted "togetherness." A simple theme. But powerful, nonetheless.

Joe:
 Come on, "overcoming adversity"! Let's go, "overcoming adversity"!

Quagmire:
 Show me "women I gave the clap to"! Oh!

Charlton Heston:
 And the Harvest Festival Parade theme is: "The episode of 'Who's the Boss?' where Tony sees Angela naked in the shower."

Peter:
 Yes! That's mine! Un-freaking-believable! [Cheering]

Stewie:
 Oh! Clumsy oaf! Michael Flatley must be turning over in his grave. Wait a minute. He's not dead...yet. "Michael Flatley."

Lois:
 Peter, it's great they picked your theme, but isn't it a little esoteric?

Peter:
 Esoteric?

Peter:
 Lois, "Who's the Boss?" is not a food.

Brian:
 Swing and a miss.

Meg:
 I have no friends, and it's all because of this stupid purse!

Peter:
 What did you do to my daughter? I swear to God, if you touched her-

Lois:
 Peter! Honey, what happened?

Meg:
 Well, it was lunchtime and...

 Canner:
 Meg, let me tell you about popularity.

 Canner:
 Bye!

Meg:
 Daddy, if you really loved me, you'd buy me a Prada bag.

Peter:
 I can't say no to you, honey. What are they, like, $10?

Meg:
 More like $1,100.

Peter:
 [Laughing] You wish I loved you that much!

Peter:
 We're never gonna get this float done in time for the parade. Pick up the pace, guys!

Joe:
 Peter, your theme is a dud.

Cleveland:
 Yeah. I've never even seen "Who's the Boss?"

Quagmire:
 Tuesdays in the '80s I was always in bed by 8:00...and home by 11:00. Oh!

Peter:
 But I can't do it without you guys, because I'll tell you who's the boss. It's not Tony or Angela. It's not even man-crazy Mona. It's all of us. Quagmire, you're the boss because you never give up, like with the ladies.

Quagmire:
 Gemini. Augh! Capricorn. Augh! Well, I know you're not a Virgo! Augh!! Hey, from down here, you look like a Pisces! Augh!!!

Peter:
 And Cleveland, you're the boss because of your attention to detail. Like when we play pool, you take so long to line up your shots, I just want to crack you with a cue stick. But I don't because that would be a hate crime, and I love you. And Joe, I've had new neighbors before, but none of them were half the man you are. And since you're half a man already, that splits them into some kind of fraction I can't even measure.

Joe:
 Peter's right. If we work together, we can win this thing. Who's in?

Quagmire:
 Go, Spooner Street!

Kevin:
 My dad always says, "Measure twice, cut once."

Kevin:
 We didn't measure! We didn't measure!

Brian:
 Amazing, Peter, you've inspired the whole neighborhood to work together.

Peter:
 You know what's really amazing, Brian? I haven't brushed my teeth in three days, and no one has said a thing.

Meg:
 Hey, Stewie, if I had a job, I could buy the bag myself.

Stewie:
 Hmmm. I squandered my munitions budget on that insipid Rugrats video! Perhaps I should seek employment. Mother teaches piano; I suppose I could as well.

Stewie:
 All right, try it again, Richard. And remember, the wrong keys are electrified.

Richard:
 Augh! I don't want to play the piano!

Stewie:
 Indeed. Would you rather play the bassoon?

Girl:
 [Playing bassoon] [Screams]

Flappy:
 No experience? No, thanks.

Waitress:
 [Whispering]

Flappy:
 Oh, nuts. Young lady! What's the little guy's name?

Meg:
 What do you care?

Flappy:
 Well, I can't send an unwed teenage mother out on the street without a job.

Meg:
 Stewie. My son's name is Stewie.

Stewie:
 [spits out cookie]

Diane Simmons:
 Welcome to the 83rd annual Quahog Harvest Festival Parade. Are you as excited as I am, Tom?

Tom Tucker:
 Are you kidding, Diane? I've got wood...and clipped onto this piece of wood is a list of this year's float entries.

Diane Simmons:
 Remember, the float that best captures this year's theme wins Quahog's coveted Golden Clam.

Tom Tucker:
 And here's our first float.

Diane Simmons:
 Oh, looks like some wires got crossed on Clover Street. That's not Angela. That's Mona, Angela's mom.

Tom Tucker:
 Wonderful use of tree bark for the age spots though.

Diane Simmons:
 Mmm-hmm.

Tom Tucker:
 This one's got Tony bathing Jonathan. Well, that's just plain wrong.

Diane Simmons:
 Each float possesses its own unique charm. But none of them-

Tom Tucker:
 Oh, baby! Look at that!

Joe:
 Peter, the float turned out great.

Peter:
 Yeah, our neighborhood hasn't been this united since Quagmire figured out how to get us free cable.

Cleveland:
 We are not bad people. We just don't want to pay $12 a month for Cinemax.

Diane Simmons:
 First place goes to Spooner Street.

All:
 [Cheering] We won! All right! [Uncomfortable laughter]

Loretta:
 Come on now! This is damn foolish!

Peter:
 My theme, my trophy!

Quagmire:
 My aunt Fanny! You said it yourself, Peter! I'm the boss!

Cleveland:
 Well, he said I, too, was the boss. And it's time Cleveland got his due.

Bonnie:
 Joe, my feet are starting to swell.

Joe:
 You two go home. I can stay here as long as it takes. You'd be amazed how little you have to eat when your legs don't work.

Peter:
 There's only one way to settle this. Russian Roulette. Three bullets, last guy standing keeps the trophy. Me first. No, no, no, wait a minute, this is crazy. You first.

Brian:
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. There's gotta be a way for you all to enjoy the trophy.

Peter:
 Wait a minute! I got it! No, lost it. There it is again!

Lois:
 Perfect, Peter. Now we can all enjoy it.

Cleveland:
 Here's to togetherness!

Peter:
 Car. Car! Car!

Flappy:
 Meg, order up!

Waitress:
 Here you go, hon. From Flappy himself.

Stewie:
 I don't care if they're from Kubla filthy-wretched Khan!

Waitress:
 Try them. You'll like them.

Stewie:
 Yes, well, I rather doubt that. I-oh. Yes! These are delectable. Flappy, good news! I've decided not to kill you!

Woman:
 What a precious little boy.

Meg:
 Oh, that's my-uh, son.

Woman:
 Your son? But you're just a baby yourself. Henry, give the little skank a nice tip.

Meg:
 $20! Welcome to Flappy's. Why don't you have a seat next to my little baby whose deadbeat dad doesn't pay child support.

Stewie:
 [Belching] Ha!

Peter:
 [Horrified scream]

Lois:
 Peter, what is it?

Cleveland:
 What's going on out here?

Joe:
 Clear the way! I'm a cop! Oh, my God! I thought the safety was on. I'm so sorry.

Charlton Heston:
 That's okay, son. It's your right as an American citizen. [moaning]

Quagmire:
 What's all the noise, boys? I was just jerk-ed out of a sound sleep.

Cleveland:
 Perhaps someone could enlighten me as to the whereabouts of our Golden Clam?

Quagmire:
 Maybe it fell.

Peter:
 Yeah. Right into someone's pocket.

Bonnie:
 You think one of us stole it?

Peter:
 I never said the word "stole." Looks like someone has a guilty conscience.

Joe:
 Guilty conscience! Ha! I'm the only guy on this block who actually pays for his cable.

Bonnie:
 Oooh.

Cleveland:
 Pretty high and mighty for a man who left our nation's flag out in the rain last Fourth of July. That's against the law, Officer!

ALL:
 Oooh.

Quagmire:
 You're one to talk. Out there every trash day picking through my garbage. That's an invasion of my privacy.

Loretta:
 He's sorting your recycling because he loves our Mother Earth. If you weren't so busy trolling for booty all the damned time, you could do it yourself, like the law says you should.

Peter:
 Oh, it's on now!

Joe:
 Wait a second! What about Peter? He's the one who wanted the trophy all along!

Peter:
 I couldn't have stolen it. Last night I was stealing Joe's ladder so I could steal the trophy tonight.

Peter:
 What? It's a ladder. He can't use it. It's like taking a watch off a dead guy.

Bonnie:
 Those Griffins always were oddballs, Joe. Real oddballs. I don't trust them.

Lois:
 I saw them taking coupons out of our mailbox.

Quagmire:
 I don't like the look of her!

Rod Serling:
 I offer you a recipe. Combine one part small-town neighborhood with a dash of missing trophy and what you're left with is a gumbo fit only for a madman. A gumbo served almost exclusively in The Twi-

Peter:
 Who the hell is that? I bet he took it!

Joe:
 Where are you going, Serling? Want some of this?

Quagmire:
 Come back here!

Meg:
 Well, I'm off to work.

Peter:
 Okay, honey. One of our neighbors took that trophy, Lois, and I'm gonna find out who.

Meg:
 I'm taking Stewie with me again.

Lois:
 Fine, sweetie. This whole thing just makes me sick!

Peter:
 For crying out loud, we played Pictionary with them!

Lois:
 Bastards!

Stewie:
 Giddy-up, you stubby little mare! To the pancake house! Hiya!

Meg:
 Well, bye.

Lois:
 And to think they used to be our best friends!

Peter:
 That was then and this is now! And this is a chair. And that's a lamp. And you have boobies. And I'm gonna find that trophy!

Joe:
 Well, to be honest, Peter, we were all a little surprised you invited us over.

Peter:
 Well, we realized our friendship is a lot more important than some stupid trophy.

Peter:
 Oh, there's the tea. I'll get it, Lois. Two sugars, right, Bonnie? [forced laughter]

Peter:
 Damn, it's not here!

Peter:
 Not here either.

Peter:
 Huh. Nothing.

Lois:
 Oh, my God! We were robbed!

Peter:
 Is anything missing?

Lois:
 No. I don't think so. Hey, where's that picture of me in my two-piece at the Cape?

Chris:
 Should I call the cops?

Peter:
 No, I'm guessing a cop may have had something to do with this. Or a pilot. Or a deli owner. Okay, you dirtbags! This means war!

Lois:
 Excuse us. We're having a small problem with home security.

Peter:
 Do you guys have those round metal things that you bury in the ground and, when stepped on, they explode?

Clerk:
 Land mines?

 Lois:
 Land mines.

Peter:
 It was land mines.

Peter:
 Quagmire.

Quagmire:
 Peter.

Joe:
 Cleveland.

Cleveland:
 Joe.

Lois:
 Bonnie.

Bonnie:
 Lois.

Quagmire:
 Cleveland.

Joe:
 Lois.

Cleveland:
 Bonnie.

Lois:
 Quagmire.

Bonnie:
 Peter.

Loretta:
 [Clears throat]

Cleveland:
 Loretta.

Lois:
 Come on, Peter.

Peter:
 That ought to slow them down.

Meg:
 Being a single mother is hard. But the real challenge is having a baby that's addicted to crack. Right, Stewie?

Stewie:
 What's that? Oh, yes. I love crack. I'm absolutely coo-coo for crack!

Meg:
 This is the first time he's eaten something other than dog food in three weeks. Well, here's your check. God bless.

Waitress:
 Here, honey.

Stewie:
 What's this? Blueberries? Oh, my.... Oh, that's better than sex!

Sandy Balfour:
 Oh, and could I get that waitress' address? I'd like to help her baby.

Lois:
 What are they up to?

Peter:
 Well, Cleveland and Quagmire are holding their positions but I haven't seen Joe all day.

Joe:
 Freeze!

Kevin:
 Dad?

Joe:
 Careful. There's a bear trap two feet to your right.

Kevin:
 Thanks, Dad.

Joe:
 Look out for your mother!

Bonnie:
 There's a sandwich on the counter, honey.

Loretta:
 Cleveland, these lobster traps aren't going to catch any intruders.

Cleveland:
 Yes, they will. I baited them with these plump and tasty Fenway franks.

Sandy Balfour:
 Hello.

Quagmire:
 Hey, get the hell off my...well, hello, lips, legs, breasts, and ass.

Sandy Balfour:
 Yes. I was hoping I could ask you about your neighbors, the Griffins.

Quagmire:
 The Griffins! A bunch of card-carrying Commies if you ask me! All right. No! No, no! It's not all right!

Cleveland:
 The Griffins are not to be trusted.

Loretta:
 Mmm-mmm.

Joe:
 Those people are nothing but vile, cheating, lying scum.

Bonnie:
 And their carpet and drape scheme...[finger down throat]

Stewie:
 No! No, I won't! Get that puree of loathsomeness away from me!

Lois:
 But you love mashed turkey and peas.

Stewie:
 I'm sorry. What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Did you just tell me what I love? Hmm? Write this down, you toad-faced frump. I love pancakes!

Sandy Balfour:
 Hi, little fella. Is Meg Griffin here?

Lois:
 No, she's not.

Sandy Balfour:
 Probably out scoring more rock. Sandy Balfour, Child Services. We're placing this baby in a foster home.

Stewie:
 For God's sake, feed me!

Sandy Balfour:
 Let me guess. All out of Puppy Chow? What an awful home for a child!

Lois:
 How dare you! This is a wonderful home!

Peter:
 Quagmire, you rat bastard! Come near my fence again, and that'll be your head!

Sandy Balfour:
 Honey, would you like some pancakes?

Stewie:
 Oh, yes! God, yes! Take me!

Meg:
 Next up is Meg Griffin, sporting her stylishly cool, brand-new...

Lois:
 Oh, Meg, a woman from Child Services came and took Stewie! She said we fed him dog food!

Meg:
 Dog food, huh?

Lois:
 Meg, is that a real Prada bag? How in the world did you make $1,100 as a waitress in one week?

Meg:
 It's easy...when you're the unwed teenage mother of a crack-addicted baby. [laughing nervously]

Peter:
 Wait a minute. Meg, when did you become a teenager?

Lois:
 She's 16, Peter.

Peter:
 You knew about this?

Sarah:
 Welcome to your new foster home. Baby Stewie, say hello to your new brothers and sisters.

Hispanic baby:
 Hola, Stewie.

Chinese baby:
 Ni hao, Stewie.

African baby:
 [click click] Stewie.

Stewie:
 Good God! I've been adopted by a Benetton ad!

 Stevens:
 I promise, it'll never happen again.

Clerk:
 I hope not, Mrs. Stevens. Because next time we won't just take him away, we'll kill him. Let's see. Stanley, Starkweather, Stevens!

Chris:
 So this is where babies come from?

Brian:
 Yes, Chris. This is where babies come from.

Chris:
 You told me I came out of your vagina!

Clerk:
 Next!

Peter:
 Hi. Yeah, we're the Griffins.

Clerk:
 Griffin, Griffin...I'm sorry. I can't find your paperwork.

Lois:
 Well look harder! I want my baby back!

Peter:
 Lois, Lois, please, let me handle this. The name's Griffin. We're the ones who fed dog food to our crack-addicted baby. Jeez, I never was any good at dealing with the authorities.

Peter:
 Don't worry, Brian. I know how to handle this.

Cop:
 Sir, are you aware you were going 50 in.... I'm gonna have to ask you to put your shirt down, sir.

Peter:
 Ah, crap. I get the one straight cop in Rhode Island.

Stewie:
 [screams angrily] Damn it! I want pancakes! You people understand every language except English! Yo quiero pancakes! Donnez-moi pancakes! Click-click-bloody-click pancakes!

Sarah:
 Poor little guy. "Pancakes" must be street for "crack." Damn those parents of his.

Jack:
 Sarah, forgiveness. Now, Stewie, why don't you go play with the others?

Chinese baby:
 Stewie, come complete our rainbow!

Stewie:
 I've got a better idea. Let's go play "swallow the stuff under the sink."

Lois:
 You lied to them!

Peter:
 You told Child Services that we steal lawn mowers and cheat on our taxes and worship some guy named Stan.

Bonnie:
 Um, actually, I said Satan. That's a typo.

Quagmire:
 We didn't know who that woman was! It's not our fault!

Lois:
 No? Then whose fault is it?

Brian:
 It's all of yours! You were all working together just fine, but then you won that stupid trophy. You put some shiny hunk of metal before your own friendships.

Lois:
 Brian's right. We were so obsessed with that trophy, we lost sight of what was really going on. Well, now we have a real problem to deal with.

Peter:
 That's right! Somebody tipped off the cable company about our free Cinemax. Joe? ...And we have to get Stewie back! I remembered.

Cleveland:
 Well, we're here to help. And we must get our baby back.

Joe:
 Right on! Let's do it! Rock their world! Rock their world!

ALL:
 Yeah! Come on! Let's go! We can do it!

Sarah:
 See kids? One day the world is going to be just like our home. All races living together in harmony and love.

Stewie:
 Pancakes!

Sarah:
 He must still be working the junk out of his system. He needs hugs!

Stewie:
 Doorbell! Doorbell!

Cleveland:
 Hi. We're from the One World, One People Book-of-the-Month Club. Is there something missing in yourlife?

Jack:
 You know, I just bet there is. Sarah, we have guests! And one of them is a homosexual!

Bonnie:
 They're in place! God, it gets me hot when Joe lies to strangers. When I get him home, I swear to God I'm gonna grease up...

Lois:
 That's fine, Debbie. Go, Chris.

Chris:
 Here we go, Dad!

Indian baby:
 Stewie, would you like to learn how to wrap a turban?

Stewie:
 Why don't you teach it to the Chinese girl? Or perhaps she can learn after her people invade your country.

Indian baby:
 Yee, would your people really do this?

Stewie:
 Oh, try and stop them. And try and stop Pablo's people from using drug money to buy arms from Li's countrymen, who will in turn sell them to Ura's people so they can ethnically cleanse the rest of this nauseatingly diverse grab bag of genetic party favors you call a family. So now you all understand, yes? You all hate each other?

All:
 [Crying]

Stewie:
 Oh, hosanna! It's the lesser of two evils.

Peter:
 Oh, hey, kids. I'm Santa Claus. Just practicing for Christmas.

Indian baby:
 But you're white. Jack and Sarah told me Santa is Indian.

African baby:
 Don't be stupid! Santa is black!

Indian baby:
 Santa can't be black. We do not fear him.

Chinese baby:
 Cram it, Gandhi! Santa is Asian.

Hispanic baby:
 How can he be Asian? Santa doesn't drive his sled 20 miles under the speed limit with his blinker on! Go back to your rice paddy, Mulan!

Peter:
 Come on, Stewie. We're out of here.

Stewie:
 Dance, puppets! Dance!

Peter:
 Lois, we got him. It's all over.

Lois:
 Careful, Peter. Joe and Cleveland can't stall them anymore. They're heading your way!

Peter:
 Oh, crap!

Jack:
 Hold it right there!

Peter:
 Or what?

Stewie:
 Don't shoot! Now shoot!

Lois:
 So, we're terribly sorry we broke into your home. But we just had to get Stewie back somehow.

Sarah:
 Well, that's a very long story. But we've grown attached to little Stewie. Plus, the law's on our side.

Peter:
 Oh, you people can kiss the fattest part of my ass! We'll be back, Stewie.

Sarah:
 Wait!

Jack:
 Is that a real Prada bag?

Peter:
 I'd like to propose a toast: to our neighbors! Sure they may be black, handicapped, and a heartless sex hound, but hey-if they moved out, some smelly Hawaiians might move in.

Joe:
 Hear, hear!

Cleveland:
 Hey, where's Quagmire?

Lois:
 Yes, if it wasn't for him, we never would have found out where Stewie's foster family lived.

Peter:
 He said he'd distract that social worker.

Sandy Balfour:
 Glen, honey, I have a question for you. What do you do for a living?

Quagmire:
 Hey, I have a question for you, too. Why are you still here?

Joe:
 What the heck happened to that trophy anyway?

Brian:
 I guess some mysteries are better left unsolved.

All:
 [Chattering]

Brian:
 [moaning]

Rod Serling:
 Submitted for your approval. A family pet with the uncontrollable urge to bury shiny objects in the yard. A shameful secret that nearly buried the peace and civility of an entire neighbor...

Lois:
 Stewie seems a little feverish after his ordeal. And he keeps asking for pancakes. Let's just let him rest.

Stewie:
 Oh! Flappy, what have you done to me? It's so hot. Now I'm freezing! Oh, what I wouldn't do for one syrup-soaked bite. [Screams]

Morley Safer:
 I'm Morley Safer.

Mike Wallace:
 I'm Mike Wallace.

Ed Bradley:
 I'm Ed Bradley.

Lesley Stahl:
 I'm Lesley Stahl. And one of you is hung like an elf.

Lois:
 [Laughing] I feel so naughty.

Peter:
 Lois, what are you doing? Neither of us is drunk.

Lois:
 [Giggling]

Peter:
 Knock it off!

Lois:
 Oh, my God! I found a lump! A breast lump!

Peter:
 [screaming]

Lois:
 The important thing is to stay calm. It's probably nothing, honey.

Peter:
 That's easy for you to say. You get to keep both your cans.

Lois:
 Peter, don't talk like that! You'll see a doctor tomorrow and...

Peter:
 Oh, no, no, no. I'm not gonna see a doctor, Lois. The healthiest thing we can do is just ignore this and pretend it doesn't exist. Just like we do with the squid.

Lois:
 Earthquake.

Peter:
 Truck going by.

Peter:
 I'm gonna be fine. I'm gonna be fine. Nothing to worry about.

Black man:
 Morning.

Peter:
 Give it to me straight, Doc. How long do I have?

 Hartman:
 Mr. Griffin, I'd say you have about a month to live. But hey, what the hell do I know? I've been sued by every patient I ever had. Look at the size of this file. This is...wow. Let's just wait for the test results.

Lois:
 Finish up, honey. Then I'll put you down for a nice nap.

Stewie:
 No. No! I shall put you down for a nap, Mother! Blast!

Lois:
 I'm so worried about your father.

Chris:
 You mean because he's a borderline alcoholic?

Lois:
 No. Mommy's made peace with that.

Chris:
 Oh. 'Cause he's got a lump on his boobie.

Lois:
 Chris, that's a terrible word, "boobie."

Meg:
 Mom, Debbie Miller's dad had a lump on his breast, and he turned out okay.

Lois:
 Really? Who's Debbie Miller?

Meg:
 A girl I just made up.

Peter:
 Oh, look. There they are-my family. You know, guys, I don't say this often enough, but, uh, I'm gonna die.

Lois:
 Oh, my God.

Chris:
 You can't die! Who's gonna take me to the Father-Son dance?

Peter:
 Listen, I've had a good life. And you can always be proud of your father and all of his accomplishments.

Lois:
 Peter, there's no way you could die. You're the most important character in this family.

Peter:
 I'll take this one. But I won't pay a cent over $60.

Salesman:
 Sir, that casket costs $1,000.

Peter:
 Okay, $70.

Salesman:
 What?

Peter:
 $2,000.

Salesman:
 That's twice what it costs!

Peter:
 $40.

Brian:
 He doesn't know how to haggle.

Lois:
 Peter, what's going on?

Peter:
 I'm selling all my worldly goods, so you'll have some cash when I'm dead. Yeah, a lot of memories here. Look, my first bike. Boy, I had so much fun playing with that.

Peter:
 More tea, Mr. Bike?

Lois:
 Peter, this is ridiculous. You're going to be fine.

Meg:
 Dad, the doctor called. Your test results are in.

 Hartman:
 This doesn't look very good. No, this doesn't look very good at all. My nephew drew my portrait. It doesn't look a thing like me. Look at the nose. It's all, all...

Lois:
 Will you just tell us about Peter's tests?

 Hartman:
 Okay, okay!. Mr. Griffin, all your tests came back negative. As it turns out, the lump on your chest was just a fatty corpuscle.

Peter:
 Fatty corpuscle? Wait a minute. How the hell can a dead comedian from the silent movie era be lodged in my left bosom?

 Hartman:
 Mr. Griffin, I'm saying you're fine.

Peter:
 I'm fine? What, are you coming on to me now?

Lois:
 Peter, he's not coming on to you. He's trying to tell you that you're healthy.

 Hartman:
 Can't it be both?

Lois:
 [Kissing] My sweetie is okay.

Peter:
 Better than okay, Lois. From now on, I'm gonna appreciate all the little things in life, like you and the

Clerk:
 Your phone number.

Peter:
 Oh. [Sheepish laughter] Well, it's still pretty pricey!

Lois:
 Peter, who cares how much the bill is? You've just got the most important bill of all, a clean bill of health.

Peter:
 Jeez, Lois. How long you been waiting to crack out that gem? Aw, this sucks, Brian. Why should I have to pay this? There's nothing wrong with me.

Brian:
 Yeah, it's a shame you're not dying.

Peter:
 Wait a second. That's it! They can't make a dead guy pay his bill. All I gotta do is write "deceased" right here where it says "name." And where it says "sex," I'll write, "No, thanks. I'm dead." It's bulletproof.

Stewie:
 But you promised the fat one would perish.

Lois:
 I know. Isn't it wonderful, honey? Your father is alive and well and we can be a family for a good long... [Knocking]

Peter:
 Who are you?

Death:
 I'm Calista Flockhart. Who the hell do you think I am? I'm Death. Which one of you is Peter Griffin?

Peter:
 Uh, he is.

Death:
 Come on, man. Which one of you is Peter Griffn?

Peter:
 This is Peter Griffin.

Death:
 [Laughing] Hey, that's a good one. [Continues laughing]

Lois:
 Why are you...

Death:
 No, wait. I'm not finished holding my sides. [Continues laughing]

Lois:
 Why are...

Death:
 [Continues laughing]

Lois:
 Why...

Lois:
 Why are you here? The doctor said Peter was okay.

Death:
 Oh, the doctor! Well, I guess he must know, right? I mean, he's a doctor and everything, and I'm just Death!

Stewie:
 Excuse me. Hello! I'm Stewie. Big fan.

Peter:
 Look, Death, you made a mistake. I'm not really supposed to be dead.

Death:
 I made a mistake, huh? Then what do you call this?

Lois:
 Peter, is that your handwriting?

Peter:
 [Nervous laughter] How did you get that?

Death:
 It was emailed to me by your HMO.

Peter:
 Look, I know my doctor was hitting on me, but you don't have to call him names.

Lois:
 I don't care what that says! You can't take my husband!

Stewie:
 Mother! Where are your manners? Don't argue with our guest! Won't you join us for dinner, Death?

Death:
 Oh, no. I don't want to impose. Hey, is that turkey?

Lois:
 Yes, Death. We were in the middle of a turkey dinner-to celebrate Peter's good health.

Death:
 Oh, do you mind?

Stewie:
 Mind? Of course she wouldn't mind. It would be an honor. No, no, no, no, it would be a privilege. I-oh, dear. Listen to me prattling on like a schoolgirl. Come, come. You, heat up some gravy for our guest! My last helping of white meat was drier than Oscar Wilde.

Meg:
 Ew. How did you do that?

Death:
 Oh. Well, let's just say, when I was younger I did some films I'm not...particularly proud of. Well, that does it for me. Let's go, Peter.

Lois:
 Wait! You can't go. After dinner, we usually go into the living room and live for another 40 or 50 years.

Death:
 40 or ...[Laughing] Let's go.

Peter:
 I guess this is good-bye. Meg, you're the man of the family now. Be strong.

Meg:
 Oh, Daddy.

Peter:
 Stewie, I guess I'm not gonna be here to see you become a man.

Stewie:
 Yes. I think we all know what that's going to be like.

Stewie:
 A 20-minute call to Larchmont!? Who do we know in Larchmont?

s Wife:
 My sister-in-law.

Stewie:
 Oh, yes, right. Right. Carol. Yes. That's right. How is Carol?

Peter:
 Brian.

Chris:
 Daddy, can I come with you?

Peter:
 Ask your mother.

Lois:
 No, you can't go with him! Oh, Peter.

Peter:
 Lois.

Death:
 Okay, okay, that's good. Come on now.

Peter:
 Hey, Death, you got a file on me?

Death:
 Yeah, somewhere, it's in the car, I think.

Peter:
 Does it mention that I ran two weeks of Junior Varsity track?

Death:
 Oh, let's not do this. Hey, look, I caught Flo Jo. You don't think I can catch you? [Screaming] My ankle! Yeah, listen, don't help or anything. I'm totally fine. Damn Irish.

Death:
 Yeah. That felt good, dropping me hard on the couch like that.

Lois:
 Here's a couple of Tylenol.

Death:
 Oh, great, Tylenol. Yeah, I asked for Advil. But, you know, Tylenol, whatever. That's good.

Meg:
 I got a B-plus in Health. Is there anything I can do?

Death:
 Yeah! Why don't you boil some water and rip up some sheets there, Einstein. It's a sprained ankle. I just have to stay off it for a few days.

Peter:
 W-w-wait. You can't stay here.

Death:
 Why not?

Peter:
 You're trying to kill me! Besides, how are we supposed to explain you to Mr. Roper?

Lois:
 Oh, it's okay, Death. You just worry about feeling better.

Peter:
 Lois, what the hell are you doing?

Lois:
 Peter, don't you see? As long as he's here, you can't die.

Peter:
 Go on.

Lois:
 That's it.

Peter:
 Wait a minute. So no matter what I do, I won't die? Hey, uh, make yourself at home, Death. I'm going out for a while.

Death:
 Hey, way, wait. You can't tell anyone I'm here. For if humanity discovers I'm no longer lurking in the shadows, consequences will be dire.

Death:
 That's it. What the hell do you see in him?

Lois:
 Peter, where are you going?

Peter:
 Lois, 10 minutes ago, I was staring Death in the face. But now that I've been given another chance I'm gonna do the one thing I've always dreamed of doing.

Peter:
 I'm gonna jump off this building.

Cleveland:
 Could you repeat that, please, Peter? I believe I had something crazy in my ear.

Quagmire:
 Hold the phone. You took me away from a Swedish girlie-girl and her paralyzed, but trusting, cousin for this?

Peter:
 $1,000 says I live.

Quagmire:
 1,000 clams, huh?

Cleveland:
 What the hell?

Quagmire:
 Okay.

Peter:
 Look at that. I beat my loogie.

 Cleveland:
 [Grumbling]

Lois:
 It's your turn, Death.

Death:
 You know, I know I should find this ironic, but really, I'm just bored as hell. Hey, how old is this TV? You can probably getthe DuMont Network on this thing.

Lois:
 You know, Peter is a good man and a wonderful father.

Death:
 Here it comes.

Lois:
 Could you please find it in your heart to spare him? After all, it isn't really his time.

Death:
 What did you make this cocoa out of, crap?

Lois:
 If you want me to make it again, I...

Death:
 Sorry, Lois, it's my fault. I just assumed you were gonna make it with milk, not crap!

Lois:
 I'll be right back.

Meg:
 I brought you something to read.

Death:
 Glamour, great. I can learn how to please my man. Go get me an Entertainment Weekly. I hear it's got a great picture of me sneaking up on Tom Snyder.

Lois:
 [Screaming]

Lois:
 Wow. I should really watch where I'm going.

Stewie:
 What the deuce? Of course! It seems with Death incapacitated, my matricidal efforts are futile. I must do all I can to accelerate his convalescence. "Knick-knack paddywhack, give a dog a bone"

Cleveland:
 I can't believe you drank 300 bottles of beer without succumbing to alcohol poisoning. Peter, are you a witch?

Peter:
 Yeah. But don't tell anyone. The consequences could be dire! Hey, you guys, I bet I can go up to each one of those scary-looking bikers and say: "Hey, aren't you Richard Simmons?"

Quagmire:
 Peter, no!

Cleveland:
 Peter, now you're just being brainless.

Peter:
 Hey, aren't you Richard Simmons?

Peter:
 Aren't you Richard Simmons' best friend, Richard Simmons?

Peter:
 [Laughing]

Cleveland:
 Hey.

Death:
 Ah, that feels good. You know, actually, kid, I kind of fell into this gig. You know, I really wanted to be a wood nymph. But, man, the second Dad found out, he started in with the whole: "I have no son. I have no son," and Mom...Mom just stood there.

Stewie:
 Yes. Mothers can be quite the botheration, can't they? That's why we've got to get you well.

Death:
 What was that?

Stewie:
 Nothing!

Lois:
 Stewie, leave Death alone.

Death:
 He's okay. You know, he reminds me a lot of me at that age. I hope his teen years go better than mine. Boy, talk about awkward.

Girl:
 Oh. Oh, yes.

Death:
 Oh, Sandy! Sandy! Sandy? Oh, not again. I'm gonna be a virgin forever. Or am I?

Lois:
 Can we please talk about Peter? He has so much to live for, Death. He loves his children and me...

Death:
 Okay, okay. I'll spare his life. But you owe me, if you get my drift. What the hell are you doing? I was talking about another fruit cup. Not bad, though.

Lois:
 Peter, Death just agreed to let you live.

Peter:
 Oh, man. This really is my night. I get to live, and I'm on TV.

Tom Tucker:
 Our top story tonight, the rules of Death no longer apply.

Diane Simmons:
 That's right, Tom. Our own Asian reporter, Tricia Takanawa, filed this report, all by herself!

Tricia Takanawa:
 I'm here with Peter Griffin, the man who claims he withstood a barrage of bullets and did not die. Peter, are you saying that if I shoot you in the head with this Channel 5 pistol, you'll be completely unharmed?

Peter:
 Why don't you give it a shot?

Tricia Takanawa:
 Okay, here goes.

Peter:
 [Screaming]

Tricia Takanawa:
 What have I done?

Tricia Takanawa:
 Oh, you're awful.

Diane Simmons:
 Fascinating story, Tom.

Tom Tucker:
 It sure is, Diane. And since the laws of Death no longer apply, I can do this.

Diane Simmons:
 That's right, Tom.

Tom Tucker:
 Ha-ha! And now it's time for sports.

Death:
 Great. The whole world is laughing at me. This is high school all over again. Well, I'll show them! I'll show all of them! Oh, my God, that hurts!

Lois:
 Oh, no. You're not killing anyone tonight, mister! Not on that ankle.

Death:
 This is all your fault. And there's only one solution. You have to go out there and do my job. You have to be Death!

Peter:
 Boy, this doesn't leave much to the imagination, does it?h

Lois:
 Death, there is no way Peter can do your job. He could never kill anyone.

Peter:
 Yeah! I mean, you know, I've thought about it, like in church and stuff, but I don't think I could ever do what you do.

Death:
 Why, you think you're better than me? I'm tired of always being the bad guy. What I do has to be done.

Brian:
 He's right, Peter. You've disturbed the natural order of things. People need to be able to die.

Kate Winslet:
 No!

Leonardo DiCaprio:
 You know, actually, I think I'm gonna be okay.

Kate Winslet:
 Oh, Jack. Now we can get married and everything you promised.

Leonardo DiCaprio:
 Yeah, about that. Uh, I was pretty sure I was gonna die...'cause actually, there's this girl in New York, and it's getting kind of serious. But, you know,thanks for letting me draw you naked. I still can't believe you let me do that!

Peter:
 So what, you're saying the only way to make the world right is for me to kill someone?

Stewie:
 I know! Why don't you kill Lois?

Death:
 No. One death isn't gonna do it. You have to do something that will get everyone's attention, something huge.

Chris:
 How about if you blow up the Earth?

Death:
 Too huge. But you're thinking. I like that.

Meg:
 You could kill all the girls who are prettier than me.

Death:
 Well, that would just leave England. Wait. Wait, I have it. I'm a genius. You'll kill the kids from Dawson's Creek!

Peter:
 I knew it! I knew it! As soon as that show came on the air, I said: "I'm gonna be the one who has to kill these kids."

Lois:
 It's true. He did say it.

Death:
 A bunch of hot, young celebrities. It's perfect! The kids are on their way to LA to renegotiate their contracts. But...but their plane is gonna be making a little stopover in Rhode Island. If you go right now, you can catch the flight.

Peter:
 Forget it, Death. I'm not going to do your dirty work. There's no way I'm getting on that plane. Absolutely no way, and that's final. See? I'm still here. And there's nothing you can say that'll change my mind.

Death:
 Either you kill them, or I kill you.

Peter:
 Aw, crap! Nice plant. Note to self, do not go to the bathroom.

Man:
 Look, James, your last movie killed at the box office. Your Q-rating's through the roof. It's time we ditched the WB and concentrate on features.

James Van Der Beek:
 Sir, I don't know who you are, but just because you're sitting across from me doesn't mean you can give me career advice.

Man:
 Oh. Will you sign my ass?

James Van Der Beek:
 You have a pen?

Peter:
 Hello, Death? Guess where I'm calling from? A plane!

Death:
 That's great. Listen, those kids on board?

Peter:
 Yeah. About that, I don't think I can go through with it.

Death:
 Peter, listen, without death, the world would be a terrible place. Imagine a world where Hitler was still alive.

Announcer:
 Today on "Hitler!", we'll be talking with Hollywood hunk, Christian Slater.

Hitler:
 Now, they tell me in your next movie, we get to see your butt.

Christian Slater:
 Yes, yes, you do.

Hitler:
 Can we see it right now?

Christian Slater:
 Well, all right, Hitler.

Hitler:
 Oh! He's going to do it!

Announcer:
 If you're going to be in the Los Angeles area, und would like tickets to Hitler call 213-du werdest eine Krankenschwester brauchen!

Death:
 Look, Peter, all you gotta do is sit there. The plane is gonna crash in LA. Pilot error. Big mess. Everybody dies.

Peter:
 Jeez, everybody?

Death:
 Except you. Hold on, I'm getting another call. Brenda?

Peter:
 Still me.

Death:
 Brenda?

Peter:
 "Yes?" Just kidding, it's still me.

Pilot:
 We now begin our final approach into Los Angeles International. If you look out the window to you're right, you'll see the San Fernando Valley where my brother Gary makes a very nice living directing porn. We'll be on the

Peter:
 Aw, jeez.

Girl Scouts:
 ? We like being alive, we like being alive? ?We like being, oh, we like being, oh, we like being alive ?

Peter:
 I guess it's their time.

Pacey:
 Boy, for a teacher, you sure make love good.

Teacher:
 Actually, it's "well," Pacey. You mean to say, I make love "well." You're good to go again, right?

Pacey:
 Yeah, yeah, yeah!

Death:
 Peter? Hello, Peter? Peter, are you there? I can hear you breathing!

Peter:
 Yeah, I'm here. And you can forget it. I've changed my mind. I don't care if you do kill me, I'm not gonna kill those kids. If they die, I'll have nothing to watch on Wednesdays...other than the fine programs on Fox. Hey, open up in there!

Pilot:
 Hey, what are you doing? You're not a pilot. I know every pilot in the world!

Peter:
 I'm here to keep you from making an error. A pilot error. Jeez, I probably should've worn mittens!

James Van Der Beek:
 Nice going, fat...

Peter:
 Hey, I was just trying to save your lives. But now you're all gonna die. No one can land this plane.

Karen Black:
 I can.

Peter:
 Thank God! It's Karen Black! She landed a busted plane in "Airport '75"? It was a movie, in the '70s. Ah, you damn kids with your music.

Tom Tucker:
 Both of the pilots were killed. Fortunately for the other passengers, actress Karen Black, star of such films as "Nashville" and "Five Easy Pieces," was on board.

Diane Simmons:
 Our hats are off to Miss Black for proving once again, that, given the opportunity, actresses over 50 can land large aircraft.

Tom Tucker:
 Karen Black. What an obscure reference.

Death:
 Hey, what the hell? I told you to waste those kids from "Dawson's Creek."

Lois:
 You're missing the important thing here. You said you wanted everyone to know the rules of death apply. And now the whole world does.

Death:
 Yeah, I guess so. You know, my ankle's starting to feel better. I should probably get out of your hair.

Stewie:
 Oh, but you just got here! Oh, we can stay in touch, can't we? Oh, oh, oh, what's your e-mail? Mine is "LoisMustDie," all one word, @yahoo.com."

Peter:
 Wait a second. Death? I used to fear you, but now I'm glad we met. Because you've given me a great gift-the complete Boz Scaggs. How did you know?

Death:
 I just had a feeling.

Lois:
 We're gonna miss you, Death.

Death:
 Hey, don't worry. I'll be back...really, really soon. [Laughing] "Is he joking?" Okay, see you later.

Tom Tucker:
 It was a moving scene today at Hatch Pond as six members of the Pawtucket fire department struggled valiantly to save the life of a fish, trapped under the frozen ice. Rescue workers managed to get the fish out of the water, but unfortunately it died shortly after. Diane?

Diane Simmons:
 Well, Tom, another life was tragically cut short today. Robert Kimble, founder of a local theater group known as the Quahog Players, passed away this afternoon.

Lois:
 Oh, my God!

Diane Simmons:
 Kimble was a hands-on director who often appeared in his own shows, most recently, Miss Saigon.

Robert Kimble:
 ?La la la la la, Miss Saigon ? ? La la la la la, Miss Saigon?

Lois:
 Yes, I just heard. It's so sad. Really? They want me to be the new artistic director of the Quahog Players!

Meg:
 Are you gonna do it?

Lois:
 I don't know. It's such a big responsibility. I need a moment to think. [pause] Okay, I'll do it.

Tom Tucker:
 This just in: Lois Griffin is named the new artistic director of the Quahog Players.

Lois:
 All those years of paying my dues as musical director under that old hack have finally paid off.

Brian:
 Oh, Lois, congratulations! Our little theater group finally has a committed visionary at its helm. And such an attractive one.

Lois:
 Brian, you'll have to audition just like everyone else.

Brian:
 Oh, God, of course. I...you didn't think...you thought I was...Lois!

Chris:
 I can paint scenery.

Meg:
 Can I be in the show, Mom?

Stewie:
 Yes, you can be the dumpy teenager who stays backstage and cries because nobody finds her attractive. [vicious laughing]

Peter:
 Hey, you guys.

Lois:
 Peter, guess what? I am gonna...

Peter:
 Me first! Mr. Weed said whoever comes up with the best idea for the big Christmas toy this year gets a huge bonus.

Chris:
 Hey, Dad, why don't you invent the Frisbee? That's an awesome toy.

Meg:
 It's already been invented.

Chris:
 Then how come I never heard of it?

Peter:
 This is my chance to prove how valuable I am to the company! Sorry, Lois. What's your news?

Lois:
 Well, I-

Peter:
 Mr. Weed, distinguished members of the board, may I present this year's hottest toy...Mr. Zucchini Head. He's got stupid cool hip-hop style with his little hat and his Doc Martens.

 Weed:
 Thank you, Peter, that's enough.

Peter:
 Wait, wait, wait. This is the best part! He dances!

 Weed:
 Gentlemen, I apologize for wasting your time. Peter is an adequate assembly-line worker but you'll be happy to know our company does not pay him to think. [Laughing]

Peter:
 [Nervous laughter]

 Weed:
 I'll take this. No calls.

Lois:
 Come on, kids! The director can't be late for the auditions.

Peter:
 You should've heard them laughing at me, Lois. I got great ideas, but they look at me, and all they see is a loser. Except that guy with the lazy eye. He sees a loser and the snack machine.

Lois:
 Peter, a lot of creative people had mindless jobs. Michelangelo worked in a marble quarry. Herman Melville was a customs agent. Albert Einstein worked for the patent office.

Albert Einstein:
 And what is it you want to patent, Herr Smith?

Smith:
 I call it "Smith's Theory of Relativity."

Albert Einstein:
 Hey, look at this.

Smith:
 What?

Brian:
 I think what Lois is tying to say is you have to find a way to express yourself creatively. For example, Chris has his drawing, Meg does her birdcalls, I sing-beautifully.

Lois:
 So I've heard.

Brian:
 And Lois has her theater group.

Lois:
 Yes. And for my first production, I've chosen The King and I. It's a wonderful story about a loving, patient woman who introduces culture and civility to a barbaric, patriarchal...Peter, please don't wipe your nose on the couch. Look, I have to go. Part of being creative is figuring out what you're good at. I know you can do it if you put your mind to it.

Peter:
 You're right, Lois. Man was meant to create. That's why God invented Shrinky Dinks.

God:
 It works! Look how tiny they are! Oof!

Brian:
 ?Oh, no not in springtime ? ? summer, winter, or fall ? ? No, never would I leave you ? ?at all ?

Joe:
 Bravo!

Lois:
 Brian, that was beautiful! Thank you!

Brian:
 No, no, no, thank you. And that note you gave me, "louder," I was thinking that, and then you said it-

Lois:
 -okay-

Brian:
 -you're so intuitive. It's a pleasure...

Lois:
 Okay. All right. Next! Stewie, do you want to try out for Mommy's play?

Stewie:
 "Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of York. And all..."

Lois:
 Why don't you sing "Itsy Bitsy Spider"?

Stewie:
 How dare you reduce my finely hewn thespian stylings to mere Mother Gooseries!

Lois:
 Oh, sing "Baa Baa Black Sheep"!

Stewie:
 You know, Mother, as first lady of the American stage, Helen Hayes, once said: "I'm going to kill you!"

Peter:
 Hey, can somebody give me a hand with all this talent?

Lois:
 Peter, what are you doing here?

Peter:
 Well, Lois, I tried finding my creativity, like you said. First I took an art class.

Peter:
 Am I supposed to draw the penis?

Peter:
 Then I tried sculpting.

Peter:
 Am I supposed to sculpt the penis?

Peter:
 Then I tried music.

Peter:
 Am I supposed to conduct with my penis?

Peter:
 I was starting to think there was nothing I'd be good at. But then I realized that this is it. Lois, my penis belongs on stage.

Lois:
 Wait, Peter, everyone has to audition. You know, sing, dance.

Peter:
 [Laughs] I get it.

Peter:
 Hello, everybody. This is just a formality, since I happen to be doing the director. [Laughs] Five, six, seven, eight.

Peter:
 [out of tune] ?Marshall, Will, and Holly, on a routine expedition ? ? Met the greatest earthquake ever known ? ? High on the rapids, it struck their tiny raft ? [Yells] ? And plunged them down a thousand feet below ? ? to the Land of the Lost? [Growls]

Lois:
 Before I post the cast list, my choreographer and I want to thank everyone for auditioning.

Joe:
 You were all great.

Lois:
 Weren't they? I only wish the show was called "The King and Us" so I could cast you all.

Brian:
 [kiss-up laughing]

Loretta:
 Anna! Oh, baby, baby! I'm a star!

Cleveland:
 Wow. I've never hugged a celebrity before. Except for Pearl Bailey at a book signing once, but then we later found out it wasn't actually her.

Stewie:
 Siamese baby? Stewie Griffin does not play bit parts!

Lois:
 Oh, you wanted a bigger part, didn't you, sweetie?

Stewie:
 Oh, to hell with you! Perhaps I'll skip the stage and go directly to films!

[Title card:
 "There's Something About Stewie"]

Ben Stiller:
 Hello.

Stewie:
 What is that on your ear? Is that-is that hair gel?

Ben Stiller:
 Yeah.

Stewie:
 Great, 'cause I could use some.

Ben Stiller:
 No, don't!

Stewie:
 I just ran out.

Ben Stiller:
 [Sighing]

Quagmire:
 Aw, man! Chorus! Shoot, what a gyp!

Brian:
 The King of Siam? Why, why, that's the lead! This is so unexpected!

Brian:
 The King of Siam? Why, why, that's the lead!

Peter:
 Lois, I think you made a mistake. I'm not "The King." I'm not "I," I'm not anybody. So, what? I had sex with you for nothing?

Lois:
 No, Peter, I.... It's just that directing this show is a big opportunity for me and I don't want anything to ruin it.

Peter:
 Ruin it?

Lois:
 Yes. By not using you to your full potential. You have too much talent for the stage. You should...[stuttering]...you should be a producer.

Peter:
 A producer? Gee, I don't know.

Peter:
 Great news, Edgar Bronfman, Jr. We made the deal. We're richer and more powerful than ever! I'm the king of the wor-[screams]-damn it!

Mexican man:
 [Spanish] Who is this?

Mexican woman:
 [Spanish] He's the answer to my prayers!

Mexican man:
 [Spanish] Why?

Peter:
 I love Mexicans. I'll do it!

Joe:
 Hang on, hang on, hang on! You overextended the plié! You screwed it all up. Let me show you again. Okay, boys! Let's do it! And one, two, three. And one, two, three. And just like this. And watch my feet. And one, two, three.

Lois:
 Peter, Chris says you told him to build a set for the North Pole.

Peter:
 Yeah, that's where Anna goes to talk with her best friend, a penguin.

Lois:
 There is no talking penguin in The King and I.

Peter:
 There is in "Peter Griffin presents The King and I."

Peter:
 Now we just gotta think of some wicked funny stuff for him to say.

Lois:
 Peter, the director decides whether or not to add a character. You're the producer, remember?

Peter:
 What am I supposed to do with all my great ideas? Put 'em in a tub and clean myself with them? 'Cause that's what soap is for, Lois.

Lois:
 Good producers put their ideas to work outside the theater. It's your job to make sure we sell every seat in this house.

Peter:
 And that's creative?

Lois:
 Is it? Well, it's just the most creative job there is.

Peter:
 Don't you worry, Lois. I'll get the word out. I'll tell two friends, and they'll tell two friends and that's, like, 10 people right there.

Tom Tucker:
 [to self in mirror] Hey, I recognize you from the television. You're Tom Tucker. I bet you can do this.

Peter:
 Excuse me?

Tom Tucker:
 You. Get out of here! Get out of here! Go on, get out of here!

Peter:
 Oh, wow! Diane Simmons!

Diane Simmons:
 You don't look anything like the ad. You better be huge.

Peter:
 No, I'm Peter Griffin, producer. I'm presenting "Peter Griffin presents "The King and I" a Peter Griffin production, and I'm giving you the exclusive story.

Diane Simmons:
 Look, pal, some two-bit community theater production isn't news. Who's the star? For that matter, who the hell are you, and why should I give a damn?

Peter:
 Wow, I'm being interviewed by Diane Simmons!

Peter:
 Well, Lois, you told me to produce, and I did. I got us a story on the 11:00 news.

Diane Simmons:
 Our top story tonight. I will be playing the role of Anna in the Quahog Players production of The King and I. Tom?

Tom Tucker:
 Thanks, Diane. In other news, I won't be going to the play because I'm sure it will be lousy.

Diane Simmons:
 Tom, I'm getting late word that you're a petty, jealous, closet case.

Tom Tucker:
 Bit of breaking news. We now go live to Diane being a bitch. Diane?

Lois:
 But Loretta's playing Anna, and she's doing a great job.

Peter:
 Loretta's a nobody. Diane Simmons is a star. Look, Lois, you wanted me to sell tickets, right? Well, people who've never even been in a theater will come see a show with Diane Simmons.

Lois:
 I don't know, Peter, she's a news reporter.

Peter:
 Hey, hey, some of our greatest actors started in news, like Sean Penn.

Sean Penn:
 Today's weather calls for breezy skies and sun, and there's gonna be a...get that [bleep]ing camera out of my face!

Peter:
 Hey, everybody, here's our star!

Diane Simmons:
 Oh, this is so awkward. You all know my name, and I've never heard of any of you.

Loretta:
 You ever acted before, honey?

Diane Simmons:
 Well, I did an independent film in college.

Lois:
 Let's start with the scene where Lady Thiang begs Anna to comfort the king.

Diane Simmons:
 Oh, are you playing Lady Thiang?

Loretta:
 Mmm-hmm. I was supposed to be Anna.

Diane Simmons:
 Oh. Well, they did an all-you-people version of Hello, Dolly that was very successful.

Lois:
 Okay, let's go from the top of Scene 7. Action!

Loretta:
 "Oh, Mrs. Anna, the king needs you. You must go to him."

Diane Simmons:
 "Lady Thiang, if he needs me, truly needs me, I will go to him."

Peter:
 Cut! All wrong! No good!

Lois:
 Peter, what are you doing? She was wonderful.

Loretta:
 My ass.

Lois:
 Besides, I'm the director.

Peter:
 It just doesn't feel real, you know? Anna and Miss Thing both love the king, right? On Springer yesterday, they had "I won't share my husband" and these two women bitch-slapped each other. The crowd went nuts. Loretta, why don't you try slapping Diane?

Loretta:
 I think I can do that.

Lois:
 Wait a minute. Nobody's slapping anybody. This is Rodgers and Hammerstein, not trash TV!

Diane Simmons:
 I think Peter may be onto something. Springer is one of our station's highest-rated shows.

Lois:
 I don't know.

Peter:
 I thought you wanted to do a good show? If you want to do a bad show, why don't we just do Rent?

Lois:
 I guess we can try that...

Loretta:
 Action!

Peter:
 Come on, Lois. Those hoop skirts make Diane look a little hippy, you know? I was thinking we could dress her in a pair of sequined capri pants.

Lois:
 Peter, they didn't have capri pants in the 1860s.

Peter:
 They did now! Ah!

Stewie:
 You! You are the worst thing to happen to musical theater since Andrew Lloyd Webber! And you! Well, I just plain don't like you.

ALL:
 [Laughing]

Lois:
 What's going on?

Peter:
 We're just having a little pow-wow to discuss my latest changes.

Lois:
 What changes?

Peter:
 The Siamese children. How about this? They're not children. They're aliens!

Quagmire:
 That was great, Peter.

Brian:
 Right on the money.

Diane Simmons:
 Isn't he brilliant?

Lois:
 No! He's not brilliant! Rodgers and Hammerstein were brilliant! And I want to do the show they wrote! We're not making any more changes!

Meg:
 We sold out!

Chris:
 Yeah. The whole town's talking about your show, Dad!

ALL:
 [Cheering]

Lois:
 Your show? Peter, this is my show!

Peter:
 What's the big deal? You wanted to sell out, and we did.

Lois:
 I am through selling out. I took this job because I wanted to create something beautiful and you've completely destroyed that! You want to be the director? Fine! I quit!

Peter:
 Me, direct? I don't know what to say, except, "I'm the king of the wor-" Ah!

Peter:
 Morning, theater fans!

Lois:
 Good morning, Peter. I made your favorite breakfast.

Peter:
 What the hell is this?

Lois:
 French toast. I just made a few creative changes to the recipe. I think it's a lot better now.

Peter:
 Lois, if this is your idea of a joke, you must write for Leno.

Stewie:
 Oh, oh! You know, it is so fashionable to take a shot at Jay Leno. Look, the fact is the man is out there every bloody night with fresh material and he's charming.

Peter:
 Face it, Lois, you're just jealous because people like my ideas better than yours.

Lois:
 I don't care if the whole world loves your ideas. That doesn't make them good. I was trying to make art.

Peter:
 Oh, art-schmart. Put enough monkeys in a room with a typewriter they'll produce Shakespeare.

Lois:
 Peter, you've never done a creative thing in your life!

Peter:
 That's not true. I wrote "Bonfire of the Vanities."

Lois:
 No, you didn't.

Peter:
 You win this round, Lois.

Lois:
 You're not being creative. You're just destroying a wonderful show.

Peter:
 Hey, I have more creativity in my whole body than most people do before 9:00 a.m.

Lois:
 The only thing you create before 9:00 a.m. is exactly what you've turned my show into.

Peter:
 I think my work will speak for itself. Oh, ha-ha, I just got that. A poop joke? That's real creative, Lois.

Peter:
 Okay, let's run this scene again. Now, remember, Diane, you're playing Anna, a steel-town girl on a Saturday night looking for the fight of her life.

Diane Simmons:
 Where does it say that?

Peter:
 In my noodle. Okay, places. And action!

Peter:
 Stop! All wrong! All wrong! God, send me dancers.

Diane Simmons:
 We've been rehearsing for hours. I'm exhausted!

Peter:
 Well, I'm sorry, but we open this show in three hours and I don't think we're ready!

Diane Simmons:
 Of course we're not! You keep changing everything!

Peter:
 You bet I do! Because theater is alive. It's a living, breathing creature with wants and needs and you're not man enough to satisfy her!

Diane Simmons:
 I can't work this way. I quit!

Joe:
 We can't do The King and I without Anna.

Quagmire:
 Yeah. This is a real snafu.

Peter:
 We don't need Diane Simmons. We've had someone better all along. Someone radiant and sassy, with the soul and passion that can only come from hundreds of years of black oppression.

Loretta:
 Thank you, Peter. I'll do it.

Peter:
 Get over yourself. I was talking about me.

Brian:
 Su-su-sudio. Su-su-sudio.

Stagehand:
 Two minutes, everybody. Two minutes.

Brian:
 Fe-fe-fo-fo.

Peter:
 Jeez, full house. Well, well, look who came crawling back.

Joe:
 Peter, have you seen my wheelchair?

Chris:
 I don't get it, Mom. If you're mad at Dad for wrecking your show, why'd you come to opening night?

Lois:
 I came because I love the theater. I mean, if I just came here to enjoy watching your father be humiliated when this asinine spectacle of his is ridiculed by everyone in town what kind of person would I be?

Chris:
 A bitch.

Peter:
 [voiceover] Siam, 2015 AD. The city lies in ruins after the ninth nuclear World War. It is a grim future with lots of explosions and partial nudity. A future where an oppressive new king has seized power. Only one man can stop him. No-one machine.

Peter:
 I am an Automaton Nuclear Neo-human Android. You may call me ANNA. I am a robot ninja from the planet England who is here to destroy you and free this land from your tyranny.

Brian:
 I have been expecting you, ANNA. Allow me to introduce my Siamese children.

Peter:
 I will not be swayed by your attempts to confuse my programming with your all-female sex orgy. We must kung fu fight!

Brian:
 So be it, ANNA.

Peter:
 I have slain the evil emperor. I hereby proclaim Siam the United States of America.

ALL:
 ?ANNA rules!?

Peter:
 ?'Cause I kicked all the bad guys in their jewels!?

ALL:
 ?ANNA won!?

Peter:
 ?Thanks to my gamma-ray atomic gun!?

ALL:
 ?Dance and shout ? ? He's the world's greatest ninja, there's no doubt?

Peter:
 ?Though they tried to defeat me ? ? they can all just freakin' eat me?

Brian:
 ?Because he blew all of us away?

ALL:
 ?In the planet of Siam, there's no one as tough as I am?

Peter:
 ?Just as surely as Paul Lynde was gay?

Lois:
 Oh, my God! They liked it? Stop it! Stop clapping right now! What's wrong with you? These people shouldn't be encouraged! They should be punished! That man has committed murder here this evening, and the victim's name is "theater." This is the kind of mind-numbing schlock that's turning our society into a cultural wasteland! This isn't art! This isn't even entertainment! This...blows!

Peter:
 Uh...[Farting] [Continues farting]

Lois:
 See? This is exactly the kind of thing I was talking about.

Lois:
 How was the cast party?

Peter:
 We're a hit. Man, what a night. I got to see my ideas come to life. It's the greatest feeling in the world.

Lois:
 Yeah, I bet it is.

Peter:
 And it's all thanks to you. I never would've discovered I could be creative if you hadn't believed in me.

Lois:
 Well, actually I didn't, really, not at first. But anyone who could take The King and I and turn it into that is...well, he's gotta be creative.

Peter:
 Yeah, Lois, sorry I took your show away from you. But I'll do whatever it takes to make sure you get your chance next year. It'll be "Peter Griffin presents a Lois Griffin production." Okay, honey?

Lois:
 Deal.

Peter:
 [chuckling] Hey, were you there when I farted?

Woman:
 Boy, that lotion sure feels good.

Woman:
 And it just got hotter! Here, now let me do you.

Announcer:
 Pawtucket Patriot Beer. If you buy it, hot women will have sex in your backyard.

Lois:
 Typical male fantasy-women drinking beer. I guarantee you a man made that commercial.

Peter:
 Of course a man made it. It's a commercial, Lois, not a delicious Thanksgiving dinner.

Chris:
 Dad, we won a boat! We won a boat!

Peter:
 Holy crap! We did! We won a free freakin' boat!

Meg:
 Dad, nobody gives things away for free.

Peter:
 That's not true. I know plenty of people who give things away.

Crowd:
 Free Tibet! Free Tibet!

Peter:
 I'll take it! <dials phone> Hello, China? I have something you may want. But it's gonna cost you. That's right. All the tea.

Lois:
 I knew there was a catch. You have to sit through one of those awful time-share presentations.

Peter:
 Oh. that's a small price to pay. I am gonna be the first one on Spooner Street to have his own boat!

Quagmire:
 Whoa! All hands on deck! I'm getting a boat!

Cleveland:
 Hey, Quagmire. I'm also getting a boat, too.

Joe:
 Right on! Whoo! I can't wait to get my sea legs! Yeah!

Peter:
 Well, at least I'll be the fattest guy on Spooner Street to get a boat.

Fat Albert:
 Hey, hey, hey! I'm getting a boat!

Peter:
 Oh, man! Even Della Reese is getting a boat.

Salesman:
 These wonderful homes on this beautifully secluded island can be yours with almost no strings attached. Beautiful island. Nothing out of the ordinary here. Just beautiful homes and nothing else. Each residence has 200 feet of pristine oceanfront. No city noise, no flesh-eating ogres, no pollution.

Lois:
 I hate these high-pressure sales situations.

Peter:
 Oh, that's so cute. You're just afraid that because you're a woman you're gonna do something stupid like buy that time-share, or not realize that your husband taped over our wedding video with softcore cable porn.

Lois:
 You taped over our wedding video?

Peter:
 Relax, Lois. I just taped over the boring stuff.

Priest:
 The couple has written their own vows, which they will now recite to each other.

Lois:
 Peter, I...

Woman:
 Look, the only reason I got myself arrested was to find out what happened to my sister.

Guard:
 Excuse me, ladies. It's laundry time.

Woman:
 It's so cold in here. I mean, look at my...

Lois:
 Oh, my God, Peter! I sent a copy of that tape to my Great Aunt Lil!

Old Woman:
 This wedding is hot!

Old Man:
 Wake up, damn it! Wake up!

Jim Kaplan:
 Hello, Mr. And Mrs....Griffin. Now, I know you've been here all day. So, if you'll sign this contract without reading it, I'll take your blank check and you won't not be not loving your time-share before you know it.

Peter:
 Oh ho, look slick, we're not gonna buy your lousy time-share, all right? Now, where's my boat?

Jim Kaplan:
 Hold on! You have a choice. You can have the boat or the mystery box.

Lois:
 Are you crazy? We'll take the boat.

Peter:
 Not so fast, Lois. A boat's a boat. But the mystery box could be anything. It could even be a boat. You know how much we wanted one of those.

Lois:
 Then let's just...

Peter:
 We'll take the box.

Lois:
 "We'll take the box." You gave up a boat for free tickets to a crappy comedy club.

Peter:
 Come on, Lois! You're acting like this is the first time I've ever done something stupid. You remember the time I was supposed to get that boat?

Peter:
 A boat's a boat. But the mystery box could be anything. It could even be a boat. You know how much we wanted one of those.

Lois:
 Peter, that just happened 10 minutes ago.

Peter:
 Who cares? I'll bet nobody took the boat. Who could resist the call of the mystery box?

Cleveland:
 Yahoo!

Quagmire:
 Hey, look at me. I'm the man in the boat. All right.

Bonnie:
 Joe, look to the right. It's the Griffins.

Joe:
 We're nautical now, baby-that's called "starboard." But I'll forgive you, because you sex me up. Now, give me some sugar. Hey, neighbors! Where's your boat?

Lois:
 We didn't take the boat. We took the mystery box. Hop in.

Cleveland:
 Hey, Quagmire. Maybe the comedian will tell some jokes about boats or boating or owning a boat.

Quagmire:
 Yeah. Or maybe he'll tell some jokes about being a sucker!

Cleveland:
 Oh, Quagmire. You're what the Spaniards call el terrible.

Brian:
 What are you so upset about? I never even knew you liked boats.

Peter:
 Hey, hey, boating's in my blood. Ever since my great-grandfather, Huck Griffin, rafted down the mighty Mississippi.

Jim:
 What did you just call me?

Huck Griffin:
 I thought that was your name.

Jim:
 That is our word! You've got no right using it!

Huck Griffin:
 Hey, I'm cool, I'm cool. No problem. Could you pass me the oar, N-word Jim?

Jim:
 Thank you.

Peter:
 <drunk> This comic sucks! He couldn't make me laugh, even if I was laughing my ass off and he was making me do it. Come on, Skinny! Make me laugh!

Lois:
 Peter, that's a microphone stand.

Peter:
 Oh, well, pardon me for thinking a microphone stand in a comedy club should tell a joke or two. I guess I'm just old-fashioned that way.

Comedian:
 Hi. Welcome to...

Peter:
 <fake laugh> Very funny.

Comedian:
 Excuse me, sir. I haven't even...

Peter:
 Oh, oh, that one was hilarious! That was even funnier than your first joke! Hey, put skinny back up there.

Comedian:
 You think this is easy? You want to come up here and try this?

Peter:
 I thought you'd never ask.

Brian:
 Uh, Peter, maybe you shouldn't do this. You've never had a lot of luck telling jokes.

Peter:
 Okay, how many dirty, stinkin' apes does it take to screw in a light bulb? Three. One dirty, stinkin' ape to screw in the light bulb and two dirty, stinkin' apes to throw feces at each other. [Laughing]

Peter:
 Don't worry. I got it under control. [on stage] Hey, how about that Viagra, huh? You know what that stuff does, huh? Huh? Come on! What are you people, stupid? [Peter sticks beer bottle in pocket, making it appear as if he is urinating on himself] You like a little abuse, huh? Yeah. Well, you guys are stupid and ugly. If there was a stupid-and-ugly contest, you'd all win! Or lose. Whichever is funnier.

Peter:
 Hey. Hey, Lois. What do you call a woman who takes forever to cook breakfast?

Lois:
 I swear to God, Peter!

Peter:
 You call her "Lois." [Laughing]

Stewie:
 [laughing] Well, the fat man made a funny. I rather enjoyed that. Yes, yes, you cook very slowly. As a matter of fact, if you were any slower at cooking you...well, you wouldn't be cooking very fast at all, now, would you? That one wasn't very good.

Lois:
 Peter, they were laughing at you because it looked like you peed yourself, not because they liked your jokes.

Peter:
 Well, maybe that was part of my act. Urine happens to be very edgy. But I guess an unfunny person like you wouldn't understand that.

Stewie:
 Okay, okay. I've got it. If you cooked any more slowly, you wouldn't need an egg timer, you'd need an egg calendar! [Laughing] Oh, that's right. I went there.

Peter:
 Okay, okay, okay, wait, here's another one. Why do women have boobs? So you got something to look at while you're talking to them!

Men:
 [Laughing] Good one, Peter. That's what they're for, all right.

Woman:
 Are you telling jokes? I love jokes.

Peter:
 All right. Then you'll love this one. Okay. Why do women have boobs? So you got something to look at while you're talking to them. So you got something to look at while you're talking to them. So you got-

Peter:
 You wanted to see me, Mr. Weed?

 Weed:
 Peter, we have a problem.

Gloria Ironbox:
 Mr. Griffin, I'm Gloria Ironbox. I represent one of your co-workers, Sarah Bennett. She's suing you and the company for sexual harassment.

Peter:
 Sarah, Sarah...I don't-oh, is she the one we videotaped taking a dump? Why? What happened?

Gloria Ironbox:
 Sexual harassment is a very serious charge, Mr. Griffin.

Peter:
 All right, look, first of all, if I can speak in my own defense, all I did was tell a little joke. Second of all, women are not people. They are devices built by the Lord Jesus Christ for our entertainment.

 Weed:
 Peter, please! Miss Ironbox, I assure you, this company in no way condones Peter's conduct. In fact, a film on employee relations has been a mandatory part of our personnel training for 50 years.

[title card:
 Women in the Workplace ©1956]

Host:
 Irrational and emotionally fragile by nature, female coworkers are a peculiar animal. They are very insecure about their appearance. Be sure to tell them how good they look every day, even if they're homely and unkempt. "You're doing a great job, Muriel, and you're prettier than Mamie Van Doren." And remember, nothing says "good job" like a firm, open-palm slap on the behind.

Gloria Ironbox:
 Mr. Weed, I teach a workplace-sensitivity training class for the Women's Action Coalition. If Mr. Griffin completes my course, we'll drop the lawsuit.

 Weed:
 I assure you, Peter will be there. His job depends on it.

Gloria Ironbox:
 Good. I'm looking forward to it.

Peter:
 You know, If I wasn't so sure you were a lesbian, I'd say you were coming on to me.

Gloria Ironbox:
 All right, now, let's do some role-playing. I'll be the office assistant. Mr. Henson, why don't you play the boss, and we'll see what you've learned tonight?

 Henson:
 Okay.

Gloria Ironbox:
 The filing is done, Mr. Henson.

 Henson:
 Thank you, Miss Ironbox. You are a valued member of our business team, and every bit as important to this company as I am.

Gloria Ironbox:
 Excellent. Mr. Griffin, why don't you come up here and give it a try?

Peter:
 All right.

Gloria Ironbox:
 The filing's done, Mr. Griffin.

Peter:
 Thank you, Miss Ironbox. You are a valued member of our business team, and I will give you a raise tomorrow if you come to work without a shirt on.

Gloria Ironbox:
 Mr. Griffin!

Peter:
 I'm sorry. That came out wrong. Let me try again. Nice ass.

Gloria Ironbox:
 You haven't heard a word I've said!

Peter:
 Now that's not fair. I've heard everything you said. It's just, you know, there's some subtleties to the rules that aren't so easy to understand. Honk honk.

Gloria Ironbox:
 Okay, that's it! Obviously, normal sensitivity training isn't enough for you! No, we're gonna have to do something drastic.

Peter:
 A week at a women's retreat. What the hell am I supposed to learn from that?

Brian:
 Well, face it, Peter. Your attitude towards women isn't exactly enlightened.

Peter:
 Oh, that's a bad mud puddle. I wouldn't want you to step in that and get your nice shoes all ruined.

Brian:
 Then you got caught peeping in the ladies' locker room.

Peter:
 Okay, move the towel. Move the towel. Oh! Oh! They spotted me.

Lois:
 Peter, I think this'll be good for you. You know I love you, but I have to admit, there are times when I wish you were a little more sensitive and.... Look at me! Look at me!

Miss Watson:
 Hello, ladies. I'm Miss Watson, director of the retreat. I'd like to welcome Peter Griffin, who's here to get in touch with his feminine side. This world would be a far better place if there were more men like him.

Peter:
 Okay, okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I'll be Charlie, and you can all be my Angels. Except you. You'll be Bosley.

Miss Watson:
 We women have so much strength inside us. If we can endure the pain of childbirth just imagine what else we're capable of!

Women:
 That's so true. Right on, sister!

Peter:
 Wah, wah! Come on-it's only childbirth. How much can it hurt?

Miss Watson:
 Peter, it's like taking your bottom lip and stretching it over your head to the back of your neck!

Peter:
 Come on. You want to hear some horror stories? You wouldn't believe what I had to go through when Lois was pregnant.

Lois:
 [Vomiting]

Lois:
 [Vomiting continues]

Miss Watson:
 Women are conditioned to feel competitive with each other when we should be supportive. Lizzie, I know you feel alone and unattractive since your husband left you. But you are a beautiful person, and I am here for you. Notice I'm making physical contact with her in order to establish a connection.

Peter:
 I think you'd make even more of a connection if you hugged her, too.

Miss Watson:
 Very good, Peter. That's true.

Peter:
 That's it. Now rub her back. Okay, that's good. Yeah, yeah, comfort her. Yeah, oh yeah, you like that, don't you? Yeah, it's okay. It's okay to like it. It's very natural. Okay, good. Good. Now smell her a little.

Woman:
 I can't do it!

Miss Watson:
 Yes, you can! Trust your sisters! Jump into the trust quilt!

All:
 Jump! Jump! Trust us! We love you! We'll catch you!

Miss Watson:
 Wonderful.

Peter:
 Okay! Me next! Me next! Okay, ladies. I'm gonna start with a Greg Louganis triple-salchow and tuck into a flying Mary Lou Retton half-calf. [Screaming]

Miss Watson:
 Now that you've felt a woman's pain, the learning can begin.

Women:
 Bye!

Lois:
 Welcome back, Peter.

Peter:
 Lois! I missed you so much! And my babies! Chris, be a munchkin, and bring my bags inside, huh?

Brian:
 Peter, you're...

Peter:
 Brian, put the tea on. I have stories. But first, I'm gonna go freshen up and rinse out a few things. Oh, fudge. I broke a nail. Excuse me.

Chris:
 Oh, my God. Dad's a chick.

Lois:
 I can't remember the last time we cuddled like this.

Peter:
 I can't remember the last time I loved you so much!

Lois:
 How did you get so sweet?

Peter:
 When I was born, my mommy dunked me in a barrel of sugar.

Brian:
 Oh, for God's sake!

Stewie:
 Oh, yes, I'll have the coffee cake.

Quagmire:
 Hello?

Peter:
 Hey, Quagmire.

Quagmire:
 Hey, Peter. What's up?

Peter:
 Not much.

Quagmire:
 Well, what do you want?

Peter:
 Nothin'. I'm just calling to talk. Whatcha thinking about?

Quagmire:
 What do you mean, what am I thinking about? You called me!

Peter:
 I just wanted to say hi. So, what are you...

Peter:
 Sometimes I just can't believe we could make something so beautiful.

Lois:
 He looks just like his father.

Peter:
 I really appreciate all the hard work you did giving birth and mothering our kids. I'll never know that joy.

Lois:
 Peter, I'm sure you would've been a great mother if you had the chance.

Peter:
 You think so?

Lois:
 I know so.

Stewie:
 [Suckling] [Suckling] [shuddering] [Choking and gagging]

Lois:
 You know, one of these days, I'm gonna need the mirror.

Peter:
 Oh, beans! I can't get this spit curl to.... Lois, what day is it?

Lois:
 Thursday.

Peter:
 Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I'm late!

Lois:
 If you spent less time fixing your hair...

Peter:
 No, Lois. I'm "late" late! Do we still have that pregnancy test?

Lois:
 Are you insane? You can't have a baby!

Peter:
 Well, I don't have a lot of options. I'm Catholic! God, I thought you'd be happy!

Peter:
 Oh! Oh, this is just great! Now my own wife is forced to cook dinner for her lousy husband?

Lois:
 Peter, you're my husband! At least you used to be.

Stewie:
 Oh, mother, I come bearing a gift. I'll give you a hint. It's in my diaper, and it's not a toaster.

Lois:
 Meg, can you change Stewie?

Meg:
 Fine. But this time, if a boy calls, please don't tell him I'm wrist deep in poopie.

Lois:
 Honey, I'm glad you discovered your feminine side. But I didn't want you to forget about mine. Remember this? Remember?

Peter:
 Oh, my God! That reminds me! I gotta give myself a breast exam. Uh-oh. Uh-oh! A lump! A lump! Oh, God! Oh, God! Nope, Cheeto.

Quagmire:
 Lois! How expected.

Lois:
 Hi, Glenn. I'm sorry to bother you. Is this a bad time?

Quagmire:
 Never a bad time when you're with the Q-Man. Come on in.

Lois:
 Well, as you may have noticed, Peter's been acting a little different lately. It was refreshing at first.

Quagmire:
 I know where this is going, Lois! And I'm already semi-there. Oh!

Lois:
 Anyways, Glenn, I was wondering if you and Cleveland could help change Peter back to the way he was.

Quagmire:
 Of course that's why you're here!

Quagmire:
 Don't worry, Lois. I'd do everything to you.

Quagmire:
 I'd do anything for you.

Quagmire:
 Come on, Cleveland. If we're gonna re-masculate Peter, we need to surround him with chicks! Let's blow this sausage fest and hit the International House of Tail.

Cleveland:
 No. He needs to learn how to respect his fellow man. That's what this march is all about. Respect for your fellow man.

Peter:
 I can't respect men. Men are the reason our world is in such lousy shape. If men were as caring as women, we wouldn't have crime or violence.

Jesse Jackson:
 My brothers, we need to stand together...

Peter:
 Excuse me! I'd like to say a couple of truths to the men in this audience. It's your fault we have so much crime in this country! And it's your fault we have so much violence in this country! You are ruining our society, and you should be ashamed!

Peter:
 Look, I don't care how many letters we gotta write. "The View" should be on for three hours. I mean, you just get going, and boom, it's News at Noon.

Lois:
 Can we go soon?

Peter:
 Not yet. Gloria Ironbox and Camille Paglia are gonna see whose is bigger.

Gloria Ironbox:
 Peter, I'm so glad you could make it.

Peter:
 Gloria, this is my life partner, Lois.

Lois:
 I'm his wife.

Gloria Ironbox:
 His "wife." Yes. Peter tells me you don't have a career of your own.

Lois:
 Oh, no. Life outside my kitchen is so bright and scary. I'm just here because you caught me between pregnancies.

Gloria Ironbox:
 Well, I'm sorry you're so hostile toward someone who's fighting so a woman like you can become more than just a housewife.

Lois:
 Oh, just a housewife? Look, I'm all for equality but if you ask me, feminism is about choice. I choose to be a wife and mother. And now I'm choosing to end this conversation.

Gloria Ironbox:
 No wonder your husband didn't respect women.

Lois:
 Excuse me?

Gloria Ironbox:
 I can't imagine how screwed up your kids must be.

Lois:
 You bitch!

Chef:
 Ten banana-cream pies!

Peter:
 Holy crap! This is hot! Lois, we gotta go!

Lois:
 That was wonderful.

Peter:
 Who said that? Oh, hi, Lois. I'm starving. How about a sandwich?

Lois:
 Glad to have you back, Peter.

Peter:
 Lois, less talkie, more fetchie.

Lois:
 I'm just gonna assume that's Chinese for "I love you."

Lois:
 We need to talk abo-

Peter:
 Not now. The show's about to start.

Announcer:
 Bryant Gumbel, Greg Gumbel: brothers, bike cops. "Gumbel 2 Gumbel: Beach Justice."

Greg Gumbel:
 You talk to Matt Lauer lately?

Bryant Gumbel:
 Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Played 18 holes with him on Saturday. Told him he was soft in the Arafat

Greg Gumbel:
 Oh. I like Matt.

Bryant Gumbel:
 Me, too.

Woman:
 [screams] My purse!

Bryant Gumbel:
 Come on, Greg. Let's roll.

Bryant Gumbel:
 Taste that? That's the taste of beach justice.

Peter:
 Lois, are you crazy?

Chris:
 Yeah, me and Dad haven't missed a Gumbel 2 Gumbel yet.

Lois:
 Well, you're gonna miss this one, young man. His report card came today. No more TV until your grades

Peter:
 Don't worry. I'll talk to her. After I get a little bit of courage from my old friend, Mr. Jack Daniels. [reaches for shot glass, then picks up phone] "Mrs. Daniels? MRS. DANIELS?!? Is Jack in? What? Oh, my God! When? Oh, I am so sorry." Poor old Jack. He was a wise man, but he just loved playing with that wheat thresher. Always playing with that wheat thresher!

Lois:
 Honey, hold still and let me bathe you. You're filthy.

Stewie:
 I'm filthy? I'm filthy?!? You're the filthy one. What do you say to that? How dare you!

Peter:
 Hey, Stewie, I see your bum.

Stewie:
 Oh, take a good look, fat man. And while you're at it, take pictures so I'll have something to bring to court, you wretched, filthy pervert.

Peter:
 Hey, Lois, give Chris a break. I mean, no TV? So he failed a class. It's not like he felt up his cousin in the garage that Thanksgiving when I was 19.

Lois:
 Peter, I want you to help Chris. Kids do better when parents take an interest in their schoolwork. I saw that on a two-part report on Dateline Tuesday and Dateline Gatilsday.

Peter:
 What the hell is Gatilsday?

Lois:
 Oh, NBC invented a new day so they could add another Dateline.

Peter:
 But the Gumbel show is sacred to us. Bryant and Greg have the kind of father-son relationship I want me and Chris to have someday.

Lois:
 Peter, Bryant and Greg Gumbel are brothers.

Peter:
 Oh, nice, Lois. Just because they're black, we can't learn anything from them?

Lois:
 Look-if Chris gets his homework done, you can watch it together next week. Now come on. Help me get the house ready for my mother. She's coming to visit for exactly one week.

Lois:
 Bye, Mom.

Peter:
 Sheesh. What a week that was, huh?

Peter:
 Okay, come on, let's watch the Gumbels.

Lois:
 Peter, I thought we agreed, no TV until his homework is done.

Chris:
 Mom, I'll do it after...

Peter:
 Chris finished his homework. In fact, I've been helping him study every night this week.

Lois:
 Really? Well, that's great. Enjoy your show, boys.

Peter:
 You bet we will. Tonight, Katie Couric guest stars as a very perky crack whore.

Chris:
 Hey, Dad? When you said, "Chris finished his homework," were you talking about me? Because if you were, I think you just lied to Mom.

Peter:
 Chris, everything I say is a lie, except that and that. And that. And that. And that. And that. And that. And that.

Tom Tucker:
 This is an Action News 5 News Break. I'm Tom Tucker.

Diane Simmons:
 And I'm Diane Simmons. Tom has dared me to do the news topless. I've got the goods, but have I got the guts? Find out at 11:00.

Tom Tucker:
 And if you're settling in to watch Gumbel 2 Gumbel, you're out of luck. That show has been canceled. The full story, and maybe Diane's boobs, tonight at 11:00.

Peter:
 I can't believe this!

Chris:
 I feel sick.

Peter:
 Only one thing to do, Chris. We gotta save Gumbel 2 Gumbel, and we're gonna do it Griffin 2 Griffin. Let's roll!

Chris:
 I'm with ya, Dad. What do are we going to do, write a letter?

Peter:
 No, no, I tried that once. It got me in a lot of trouble.

Peter:
 "If you don't put 'Coach' back on the air, I'll be really upset. The skillful acting of Craig T. Nelson will be missed a lot. Signed, Peter Griffin."

Lois:
 Peter, come help me with the groceries.

Peter:
 Okay, honey.

Peter:
 Craig T. Nelson!

 Nelson:
 Are you Peter Griffin?

 Nelson:
 Make it quick.

Peter:
 Okay, Chris, we're gonna get our show back on the air and were not gonna be intimidated by any slick executive types. Ooh, look at Mr. Suave.

Receptionist:
 Wait. You can't go in there.

Peter:
 Just watch me!

Receptionist:
 No, I mean you can't go in there, because that door leads nowhere. Use the door next to it.

Peter:
 All right, Callaghan, me and my son want you to uncancel Gumbel 2 Gumbel.

 Callaghan:
 Well, sir, we only air the show. We have nothing to do with it being canceled. I have all the episodes on tape. Would you like to borrow them?

Peter:
 Okay, you bastard, you want to play rough? Until you bring the Gumbels back, I am going on a hunger strike. How about that, Callaghan? Can you live with that on your conscience? Huh? You gonna eat that stapler?

 Callaghan:
 Well, you can't eat a stapler...

Peter:
 Sorry, Chris. Me and my damn appetite! This isn't the first time it's gotten me in to trouble.

Dirk Bandit:
 And in gridiron news, little Johnny Gobraun, a terminally ill 8-year-old boywho dreamed of playing quarterback for New England, got his wish today, thanks to the Grant-a-Dream foundation.

Announcer:
 Gobraun takes the snap and fades back to pass. Here comes the rush. Oh, he's sacked!

Dirk Bandit:
 Looks like little Johnny should've wished for some blocking!

Peter:
 Chris, I just thought of a way to get the Gumbels back on the air.

Chris:
 All right, Dad!

Peter:
 All we gotta do is tell a little white lie. Just go with it. [dials phone] "Is this the Grant-a-Dream foundation? My son Chris is dying!"

Chris:
 Holy crap, no! Oh, my God!

Peter:
 That was the lie.

Chris:
 Oh, you sly boots.

Chris:
 Are you sure this will work?

Peter:
 Chris, this is just another one of your crazy schemes.

Chris:
 This whole thing was your idea!

Peter:
 You'll find out.

Chris:
 Dad, you're not making any sense!

Peter:
 You just leave that to me.

Harris:
 Ah, yes. Here we go. Chris Griffin. Your dying wish is denied. Thank you!

Peter:
 Wait a minute. My son only has a short time to live. All he wants is his favorite show back on TV. How can you say no?

Harris:
 Mr. Griffin, everyone thinks their dying child is special. But these days, people who donate money to our foundation demand a little more bang for their buck. We need sick kids we can package. You know, like that one we put on Hollywood Squares.

Contestant:
 I'll take the dying boy to block.

Host:
 Okay. Jeremy, is there anything lower than absolute zero?

Jeremy:
 Uh, yeah. My white-cell count.

Peter:
 I'm telling you, Chris is dying ten times worse than those other kids. He's got a very rare disease called tumor-syphilis-itis-osis.

Harris:
 Sounds sexy. What are the symptoms?

Peter:
 What are the symptoms? Take a look! He's growing nipples all over his body!

Harris:
 They look like pepperonis.

Peter:
 Who do you think you are? My son happens to be very sensitive about his extra nipples. See, look. They're coming right off. Nipples shouldn't just come off like that.

Harris:
 Why, that's the sickest boy I've ever seen! Get me the president of television!

ALL:
 Yeah, that's good. That's at least a twelve share.

Receptionist:
 Excuse me.

Executive:
 No calls!

Receptionist:
 It's about a dying boy.

Executive:
 Hello? Well, what's he got? Sounds sexy. Get me exclusive rights to his death and you got a deal.

Harris:
 Well, congratulations, Gumbel 2 Gumbel is back on the air!

Harris:
 Mr. Griffin, I'm sorry we had to meet under these circumstances.

Peter:
 Are you kidding? I may see you again. I got two more kids at home, and I've always wanted to see some new episodes of Star Trek.

Lois:
 Stewie, it's bath time. You're filthy again.

Stewie:
 I'll show you filthy! Yes, look at me! I'm a dirty, foul little boy! I'm a nasty, squalid little hobo! I say, Mother, you have your work cut out for you now, don't you?

Lois:
 Okay, if you want to be dirty, be dirty.

Stewie:
 Where do you think you're going? I've defiled myself. I need to be cleaned! Aah!

Peter:
 There you go, kiddo. All clean.

Stewie:
 Blast! I'm frozen! I'm hypothermic! Bloody hell, I'm a woman!

 McCloud:
 Take out your pencils and start your test.

Chris:
 Uh, Mr. McCloud, I didn't study for the test, but I got a good reason. I'm dying.

 McCloud:
 Griffin, that's the lamest excuse I've heard since Steinberg's Jewish High Holiday crap. Steinberg! Take that hat off in my classroom!

Chris:
 But Mr. McCloud, I'm really dying. I have a certificate to prove it.

 McCloud:
 My God! Tumor-syphilis-itis-osis! And he still comes into school! You're excused from the test, you brave, brave boy. Steinberg, you can learn something from this fine young...damn it, Steinberg! Take that hat off!

Meg:
 Dad, Marcy Gibbons just called and she heard that Chris is dying! [crying]

Peter:
 [Laughing] Your brother's okay. That was just a little white lie me and Chris came up with to save a TV show.

Meg:
 So, he's not going to die?

Peter:
 No! [Laughing] Boy, your face was priceless when you thought he was. [Pretending to cry]

Brian:
 You're a monster.

Peter:
 Hey, Chris was in on the whole thing. Anyway, it's over and done with.

Peter:
 What the hell is that?

Singers:
 ? Oh, dyin' boy of Quahog? ?Chris Griffin, you're so brave? ?There's a smile on your face and a bounce in your step? ?as they dig your grave? ?as they dig your grave. ?

Lois:
 Do I hear singing?

Peter:
 Nope! No singing. Just us watching another hilarious episode of Good Times. You know, the sitcom that's funnier when you play it really loud.

JJ:
 Maxine is the lady who's feeling all right, thanks to the magic of Kid Dynomite!

James:
 Junior, where you been? Dinner was three hours ago!

Florida:
 Oh, forget him, James. He's an idiot!

JJ:
 Mama, what's wrong with you?

Florida:
 What's wrong with me? My name is Florida! Florida! That's the name of a state! Why is my name Florida? [crying] Oh, Lord!

JJ:
 Dynomite!

Lois:
 That is singing. Peter, there's a candlelight vigil on our front lawn.

Peter:
 Lois, that's ridiculous. There's nobody out there. You must be seeing things.

Lois:
 Peter, why are these people here?

Chris:
 ?As they dig my grave, as they dig my grave? Hey, Dad, they're singing a song about me! Oh, hi, Mom.

Harris:
 Hello, Mr. Griffin. We just came by to see if your son's taken a media-friendly turn for the worse.

Peter:
 No. Everything's fine. Thanks for checking. Bye-bye.

Harris:
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Mr. Griffin, the foundation held up its end of the bargain and got that crappy Gumbel show back on the air! You owe us a body!

Peter:
 Uh, excuse me for a minute.

Lois:
 You pretended Chris was dying to save a TV show? You're a monster!

Brian:
 Thank you.

Lois:
 Peter. You tell that man the truth!

Peter:
 Uh, just out of curiosity...

Harris:
 Shoot.

Peter:
 What happens if he's not really dying?

Harris:
 You go to jail for defrauding a charitable organization.

Peter:
 Oh, that's interesting. Will you excuse us? You're right! There's only one way out of this! Chris is all better! I cured him!

Harris:
 You cured him?

Peter:
 That's right. I have divine powers! Okay. Safe drive. Well, what do you have to say to that? I'm not going to jail, Chris doesn't have to die, and best of all, Gumbel 2 Gumbel is back on the air.

Lois:
 Oh, you're a great role model, Peter. What kind of man devalues the life of his child for a TV show?

Peter:
 Lois, anyone who wouldn't pretend their own son is dying to get the Gumbels back on TV is a racist. There, I said it.

Woman:
 It's him! It's Peter Griffin! The miracle healer of Quahog! Oh, heal me, O great one!

Lois:
 You see what your lies have gotten youe? They think you're some kind of healer.

Lois:
 Peter, these poor, deluded people think you have divine powers.

Peter:
 Well, there's really no need to do anythi-paint my house.

Lois:
 Peter, it's bad enough to lie to your family, but how can you let these people think you're a healer? This is pure exploitation.

Peter:
 No, it's not. Those films my cousin Rufus used to do were pure exploitation.

Announcer:
 From the cats who brought you Caddyblack, Blackdraft and Black Kramer v. Kramer, comes a funky flick so bad you gonna say, "Damn, that's funky."

Rufus Griffin:
 Oh, you out of time, baby.

Pimp:
 Damn!

Announcer:
 Rufus Griffin stars in Black to the Future. We talking Marty McSuperfly, dig?

Lorraine:
 Marty, I want to be your fine, sweet-ass bitch.

Pimp:
 Damn! Brother done kissed his mama!

Announcer:
 Oh, yeah.

Man:
 Get me Isaac Hayes. Isaac, you know that new sound you been looking for? Well, listen to this!

Peter:
 Come on, Lois. Stop being such a stick in the mud. Look, I'm giving these saps hope. And I'm getting the house painted for free. It's win-freakin'-win, baby.

Peter:
 Hey, flathead, chop-chop.

Man:
 [Exclaiming]

Peter:
 Hey, great job on the lawn. Now do it again, and this time leave it a little longer.

Chris:
 Hey, Dad. Hurry up. You're missing Gumbel 2 Gumbel. They caught the guy, and now they're interviewing him.

Bryant Gumbel:
 Purse snatching: society's fault, or one man's cry for help?

Robber:
 What are you talking about? I wanted her freakin' money.

Bryant Gumbel:
 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

Robber:
 What the hell's wrong with him?

Bryant Gumbel:
 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

Peter:
 Some other time, Chris. Now, where's my shoes?

Lois:
 Peter, these people are worshipping you. Don't you think there's someone who might resent that? A being who's all-knowing and all-powerful?

Peter:
 Well, someone's got a pretty high opinion of herself.

Lois:
 Not me, Peter. God. The real God.

Peter:
 Look, what's the big deal? So I told a little fib, and now people think I'm God. I mean, when did God ever say He didn't want someone else being worshipped like Him?

Lois:
 It's one of the Ten Commandments.

Peter:
 Oh, come on, Lois. Those were written, like, 200 years ago. Times have changed!

Lois:
 [screams]

Peter:
 Okay, let's stay calm.

Peter:
 Ah, Lois, if you're scared, I'll hold you close until the lights are on again.

Chris:
 Dad, it's me.

Lois:
 Well, that's the last of them. I still don't know how every light bulb could go out at the same time. Oh, my God.

Peter:
 Yes?

Lois:
 Peter, that's not funny. Those fanatics are building a golden idol of you on our lawn.

Peter:
 Wow, I look like a freakin' Emmy. Hint-hint.

Brian:
 Ah! Damn it to hell! This is embarrassing. I seem to have fleas.

Lois:
 That's never happened before.

Chris:
 Morning.

Peter:
 Geez, Chris, puberty hit you like a ton of bricks.

Chris:
 What do you mean? Ah!

Lois:
 Don't you see what's happening?

Peter:
 Of course I do, Lois. Our fresh-faced little boy is becoming a pock-marked, hideously disfigured man.

Brian:
 No, no, no, Peter. The light bulbs last night, my fleas, Chris' pimples. They're just like darkness, gadflies, and boils. Three of the plagues God visited upon Egypt when the Pharaoh angered him in the Old Testament.

Peter:
 Oh, come on, Brian, there's a logical explanation for all those things. There was a power surge, you don't bathe, and Chris has had acne problems since the fourth grade. Ah, the kids were all calling him Crisco and Pizza Face and Rootin'-Tootin' Raspberry. Remember, Chris?

Chris:
 Now I do. [Crying]

Meg:
 [screams]

Lois:
 Meg, what's wrong?

Meg:
 I was giving Stewie a bath, and...and....

Peter:
 Trust me, Meg, at his age, it's strictly involuntary.

Meg:
 No! The water, it turned all red and goopy, like blood!

Lois:
 Blood?

Stewie:
 How positively delightful. It's as if someone stabbed Mr. Bubble!

Lois:
 My baby! Get out there and tell those people the truth. Make them stop worshipping you before it starts hailing in my house!

Peter:
 There's gotta be an explanation for all this!

Brian:
 You want an explanation? God. Is. Pissed!

Peter:
 Ah! Let's get out of here!

Peter:
 Stop it! Stop it! Stop worshipping me! I'm just a big fake, like the moon landing and Marky Mark's hog in Boogie Nights, and Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman! Oh, I don't mean that completely untrue gay rumor. They're just both really phony, just like me. I'm sorry, okay? Now make it stop.

Brian:
 Peter, this is the final plague!

Peter:
 Good, 'cause this is starting to get really old.

Brian:
 Peter, the final plague is the death of the first-born son.

Peter:
 Oh, no! Stewie!

Brian:
 The first-born son.

Peter:
 Meg.

Brian:
 Your wife.

Lois:
 Chris!

Peter:
 Oh, my God. Are you okay?

Chris:
 Hey, Dad, I can see a white light at the end of a long tunnel.

Peter:
 Oh, that's great, son. Light is good. Run towards the light.

Lois:
 No, Chris, no! Run away from the light!

Chris:
 Hey, Dad, do you think they got Gumbel 2 Gumbel in heaven?

Peter:
 Yes, son, and there's no reruns or commercials, and Kirstie Alley is still hot and all those scrambled channels come in clear as a bell. Please don't take him, God. I'm sorry.

Angel:
 Sir, we think the Griffin guy gets it.

God:
 Good, good. Peggy, turn off the plagues, please.

Peggy:
 Yes, sir, Mr. Patterson.

God:
 She's new.

Brian:
 I think the plagues went away.

Chris:
 So did the white light.

Lois:
 Oh, honey!

Peter:
 Thank God! I mean, thank me! Kidding! It was a joke! It was a joke! Ah!

Lois:
 "Oh my, tomato's at 3.99 a pound, that's so high, isn't that high, it seems so high."

Stewie:
 "Ah, this is interminable! I demand to know why you insist on taking me everywhere you go. I mean, really, what could possibly happen, if you left me home by myself."

Jimmy Kahn:
 "Great party Griff'."

Stewie:
 "Girls, you know Jimmy Kahn. Jimmy make your self at home."

Jimmy:
 "Thanks."

Stewie:
 "I meant have a cheese doodle, but, whatever it's a party!"

Lois:
 "Instant stuffing or instant mashed potatoes? The choices are…"

 "Ahh, Hah, ahh. Sorry doctor Lang, I guess I'm nervous. This whole thing's a little weird."

Doctor With Irish Accent:
 "Ah never you fear, lade book, I've been doing this all me life. You see, the reason your fleas are drawn to ya, is your kidney energy is being blocked by a dark Chi. Or what we call in my country, 'we fung chow hu'.

Exterminator:
 "Logan!, you son of a bitch!"

Logan:
 "You think I'd miss this party?"

Brian:
 "I feel terrible about this whole thing, look why don't I put us up in a nice hotel for a couple of days?"

Lois:
 "(Gasp), that's a great idea Brian, it'll be like a little vacation!"

Peter:
 "You might want to bring some cash with you, cause you know some places don't take credit cards!"

Girl:
 "But mister I need real money, I can't take a credit card."

Peter:
 "Oh I see, cash only, eh, no paper trail, what are you selling? Reaper, crack, smack, horse, ex, shrooms, dust, meth? In my neighborhood, I don't think so!"

Lois:
 "Oh my what a lovely room, (gasp) and its so clean."

Stewie:

Peter:
 "Hey, Chris aren't you coming in?"

Chris:
 "Uh, Can I swim with my shirt on?"

Peter:
 "No, you can't swim with your shirt on, wait a second, what are you hiding under your shirt. Do you have bruises, did somebody hit you? Lois what did you to my son?"

Lois:
 "Will you keep your voice down? You're embarrassing him!"

Peter:
 "What are you talking about, if I wanted to embarrass him, I'd do something like this. Hey, hey everybody, hey look what Chris Griffins father, Peter Griffin's doing!"

Everybody:
 "Ewwwww…"

Lois:
 "Stop it! Chris why don't you want to take your shirt off?"

Chris:
 "Uh, Cause I'm fat."

Lois:
 "Oh, honey, no one thinks your fat."

LifeGuard:
 "I'm sorry sir you can't park your van on the diving board."

Lois:
 "This is my son!"

LifeGuard:
 "Oh, My apologies, Hey Tom! He's not a van, he's just a fat kid!"

Peter:
 "Don't listen to him Chris, I'm going to get you a soda, you wait here."

Stewie:
 "I say, hello, you there, I'm ready to get out, somebody. Oh my what was that?"

Stewie:
 "Oh hello Mr. Water Jet!"

Meg:
 "Stewie are you ready…"

Stewie:
 "Go away!"

Peter:
 "Your not fat Chris, you just come from a long line of husky Griffins, like your great, great, great uncle, Jabba Da Griffin."

Jaba:
 "Raja, naba do wa, gola wookie, nipple pinchie?"

Lois:
 "Honey, if you want to lose weight, I'll put you on a diet, and your father can help you exercise!"

Chris:
 "Really?"

Meg:
 "Why don't you do what the super models do, stick your fingers down your throat, and throw up until your skinny!"

Peter:
 "Chris, don't listen to your sister, sticking your finger down your throat doesn't make you throw up!"

Lois:
 "Peter are you okay?"

Lois:
 "Meatloaf for us, and a very special, very delicious, steamed vegetable dish for Chris."

Chris:
 "Oh, I hate vegetables."

Lois:
 "Honey their good for you."

Chris:
 "Tastes like a monkey, a monkey that's past its prime."

Stewie:
 "Mmm, this meat loaf is a symphony of flavor, it's too bad you can't have some, it's practically orgasmic. Oh Yes, Yes, Oh, Yes, Yes !"

Brian:
 "I'll have what he's having."

Peter:
 "Okay Chris time for some good old fashioned exercise. Like those guys are doing!"

Both:
 "Hup, hyup, hup, hop, hup."

Chris:
 "Dad I don't like running, the sound of my thighs scraping together hurts my ears."

Chris:
 "Hey, a Twinkie, ha ha ha ha, I'm gonna get you!"

Peter:
 "C'mon, you can do it, feel the burn Chris, feel the burn."

Peter:
 "Thata' boy, all the way up stream buddy!"

Chris:
 Screams

Peter:
 "Ok, Okay, Just relax, try to soil yourself like we practiced."

Chris:
 "Dad, this says I gained weight!"

Peter:

Peter:
 "What the hell is that?"

 Body:

Stewie:
 Caching his breath. "Oh, (Gasp), Bovine Lummox! Uhh. (Gasp), Oh God!"

Peter:
 "I'll tell you Cleveland, he's been working out all week, and he hasn't lost a pound!"

Cleveland:
 "Peter if this desperate about Chris' weight, why don't you just suck the fat out."

Peter:
 "Look if you could find a hole on the boy, do you want to put your lips on, be my guest!"

Cleveland:
 "I'm talking about Liposuction! By brother, Brodricks' a cosmetics surgeon."

Peter:
 "Is, Is He good?"

Cleveland:
 "Well, Nell Carter twice as big before Brodrick got through with her! FYI, He used the fat he took out of her to make the two kids from good burger!"

Brodrick:
 "This is a very safe procedure, son, you wont feel a thing! I'm like a Green Beret, you know, I sneak inside you, and a skulk around, like its Vietnam or something, an', and I'm sneaking through the bush, you know, and I get all the fat, like the fats' my buddies, stuck behind enemy lines, or something, you know, and when I got all my buddies, I sneak out again. I'm very mysterious when I'm inside you, you know, like a, uh, like the wind, you know."

Lois:
 "Oh, good boy, Stewie, Clean Plate! Although I think, you got…"

Stewie:
 "Yes, yes, yes, I got more of on me than in me, yes that never gets old Lois."

Lois:

Stewie:
 "Oh and feel free to use my fork, I shan't be needing it. Watch me! That's it, Watch this!"

Lois:
 "Oh Stewie, stop eating like a little piggy! Maybe we should cut down on your sweets, you're starting to get a little Buddha Belly! Chris where have you been."

Chris:
 "Dad took me to a doctor to get the fat vacuumed out of my belly.>

Lois:
 "What!?"

Chris:
 "I didn't do it, I'm just gonna stay on my diet and exercise!"

Lois:
 "Good for you, that was a very grown up decision! I mean what kind of lazy narcissistic irresponsible moron would even consider doing as unbelievably foolish as getting Liposuction! Who I ask you, Who?!"

Peter:
 "Hello!"

Lois:
 Mumbles

Stewie:
 "Oh my god, it's finally happened, he's become so massive he collapsed into himself, like a neutron star!"

Meg:
 "Mom! Can I get Lipo too?"

Lois:
 "Forget it Meg! Peter, you can't just suck 200 pounds of fat out of yourself, its not natural!"

Peter:
 "C'mon Lois, I feel great dropping kind of weight all at once, you remember how you felt after you had Chris?"

Lois:
 "And, they're off!"

Stewie:
 "Well then, Giddieyup!"

Peter:
 "Great to be thin!"

Brian:
 "Yup."

Peter:
 "You know, uh, there's something I always wanted to do, Brian, but I could never do it cause I was so heavy. But you know; now, now that I don't weight so much, I think I can! Could ya, Could you help me do it Brian?"

Brian:
 "Sure, Peter I'd be honored."

Peter:
 "Well, I was wondering if I could put a little saddle on your back and ride you like a horsy?"

Peter:
 "Oh, oh, Okay! No I understand, it's too much, its okay."

Brian:
 "You know I like Hillary Clinton I don't care what any one says..."

Brian:
 "Ahh Peter, What it is it?"

Peter:
 "Yahh. Yahh. C'mon old paint"

Brian:
 "Ow, there are bones in you ass! C'mon, C'mon."

Peter:
 "I see you, he he he he."

Meg:
 "…but mom, it could change my life."

Lois:
 "Meg, for the last time, your getting plastic surgery."

Meg:
 "Why not? It's totally safe, a lot of famous people have done it!"

Eskimos:
 "Make me proud."

Eskimos:
 "Bring pride to our village."

Eskimos:
 "Have fun, enjoy your self."

Eskimos:
 "Send fire wood!"

Peter:
 "She's right Lois, plastic surgery is great! I was thinking of having Brodrick take a look at my nose."

Lois:
 "It doesn't matter if your nose is a little bulbubsy, or your eyes are too close together, or your chest is flabby. You are who you are!"

Peter:
 "I think I know what you're getting at."

Some Guy:
 "Knock, knock." <Sounds like peter>

 "Oh this is crazy, you walk in here with your chisel jaw, and your, oh my! Uh, I liked you the way you were! Your not even real anymore, you, Peter did you get a new buttox?"

Peter:
 "I had to, my old one had a crack in it! He, he, he, he."

Lois:
 "Well, I couldn't be more angry with you, oh!" <Drooling like "ah".>

Lois:
 "You, you really let this family down, we should be embracing the things god gave us! Not telling our kids that a person is not as good someone else, because of the way they look."

Peter:
 "Ah, holy crap."

Barnabey:
 "Look there's a baby in that refuse bin!"

Fidious:
 "Not to close barnabey, if you touch it the mother won't take it back!"

Fidious:
 "Aleoup!"

Warren:
 "Excuse me sir, what is a hansom man, like you, waiting in line?"

Peter:
 "I need an adult, I need an adult!"

Warren:
 (Chuckles) "Warren Fredricks, Quahog Beautiful People's Club. C'mon in front!"

Peter:
 "But, all, all those people were in front of me!"

Warren:
 "You haven't been beautiful very long have you? Gorgeous guys like us don't have to wait in line, haven't you noticed, people will do anything for a beautiful person!"

Peter:
 "Yeah, you know, come to think of it!"

Peter:
 "Well, As a rule I would say no, but okay come in."

Peter:
 "So, uh, this is what this is like for a school project or, ah, aghhhhhh!"

BagLady:
 "Raoul Please take this hansom gentlemen's bags to his car."

Peter:
 "Thank you."

Peter:
 "Hey, when your beautiful, door magically open for you."

Warren:
 "Actually, it opened because you stepped on that black rubber square. Of course if that wasn't there, it would have opened anyway, because your beautiful!"

Peter:
 "Wow!"

Peter:
 "Hey, there's a lot of good looking people here."

Warren:
 "Of Course, this is the Quahog Beautiful People's Club, and you're our newest member. Here's your introductory basket, its got some scented lotions, Ferrari Sun Glasses, and of course, some pills to make your bowel movements smell like bakery fresh cinnamon rolls."

Stewie:
 "Ah, Damn-It!"

Brian:
 "Oh what happened, Orson fall down?"

Stewie:
 "Shut up, I, I don't want to hear it!"

Brian:
 "Well, serves you right, you spent all that time trying to make Chris jealous, and now you have an eating disorder!"

Stewie:
 "Just, Help me up."

Brian:
 "You know I would, but my doctor advised me against heavy lifting!"

Stewie:
 "Oh, Har, Di, Har, Har."

Stewie:
 "What, What the devil are you doing?"

Stewie:
 "Stop it, Stop it, I'm getting dizzy!"

Stewie:
 "Ah, Blast!"

Lois:
 "Peter, did you paste a new picture of your self, on our wedding portrait?"

Peter:
 "Yeah, I think it looks better."

Lois:
 "You pasted it over me!"

Lois:
 (Gasp) "Have you lost your mind?"

Peter:
 "Well, somebody's jealous!"

Lois:
 "Peter, have you forgotten about Chris? He need's you to help him exercise."

Brian:
 "Yeah, he finally figured out how to catch the Twinkie!"

Chris:
 "Ha, ha, I'm turning you into Pooh!"

Peter:
 "Well, I'm going to the beautiful people's club. I guess I can him with me. Hell, seeing us all in one place, might give something to shoot for."

Lois:
 "The Beautiful People's club, ha, how, how come I've never heard of that?"

Peter:
 "Lois, I can't say anymore. I'm probably already in trouble for mentioning to, a, uh, well, we, call you Normies. Okay bye!

Brian:
 "Are you going to take that?"

Brian:
 "LOIS!"

Lois:
 "What, oh Brian, I was, was, just, seeing, if the, driveway"

Brian:
 "That wasn't even a sentence! You were hoggling peter like horny school girl!"

Lois:
 "Oh, I can't help it! I know, I know, he's become a superficial, ego maniacal, jerk, but, I've never been more attracted to him! Oh, does that make me a bad person?"

Brian:
 "Yes, Yes it does make you a bad person!"

Warren:
 "Peter good to see you, come with me I've got a lot of tall statuesque people I want you to meet. What's that?"

Peter:
 "That's my son Chris!"

Warren:
 "He can't come in, (Scoffs), he's fat!"

Peter:
 "Well, let me tell you something buddy, if my son can't come in, then I'll just come in!"

Peter:
 "See ya at home."

Chris:
 "But dad?"

Peter:
 "Trust me Chris, sometimes its better not to fit in!"

Peter:
 "You're all stupid, see their gonna be looking for army guys!"

Chris:
 "Don't look at me! I'm hideous!"

Lois:
 "Peter, how could you treat Chris that way, you know he's self conscious about his weight!"

Peter:
 "What are you mad at me for? After all he gets his fat from your jeans. Which by the way I'm wearing!"

Lois:
 "Oh, I hate what you've become! Why don't you back to that doctor and have him suck the fat out of your head!"

Peter:
 "Maybe I will! And then I'll put it on my feet, and skate on Paul bunion giant skillet, to cook his flapjacks!"

Lois:
 "That doesn't make any sense!"

Peter:
 "It doesn't have to, I'm beautiful!"

Chris:
 "You're not welcome here, go away!"

Meg:
 "Wow, Chris, did you lose weight?"

Chris:
 "Uh maybe, I've been working out."

Meg:
 "Well, you look wicked skinny, I'm like jealous!"

Chris:
 "Thanks Meg, I'm jealous of your mustache!"

Meg:
 "I don't have a mustache, do I?"

Lois:
 "oh hunny, its fine, it makes you look distinguished."

Meg:
 "But mom!"

Lois:
 "Now Meg I think all my children are beautiful."

Stewie:
 "Damn you, ice cream, come to my mouth. How dare you disobey me!"

Stewie:
 "What are you looking at, you infantile, stupid, that's right, damn you and such. You can go (yawning) burn in hell."

Peter:
 "She is so jealous, of course I'm beautiful, I mean look at me."

Peter:
 "Oh, how strange must watch road, can't look away, too beautiful!"

Doctor:
 "Well mister griffin the bandages are ready to come off, but I think I should tell you, it's a miracle that your alive at all, we did all we can, but medical science has come just so far."

Kids:

Lois:
 "Oh, Peter you look like you!"

Peter:
 "I can't believe your all standing by my side after what a jerk I was, especially to you! I'm sorry Chris."

Chris:
 "That's okay dad!"

Lois:
 "Well Peter I guess you learned a pretty valuable lesson."

Peter:
 "Nope!"

Scene:
 Exterior Shot of The Griffins house. Peter, Brian, Meg, and Chris are watching T.V).

Unseen Announcer:
 We know return to Little House On the Prarie. (Exterior shot of Prarie house shown as we move inside to see a mother reading to two kids in the background and a girl reading Brail with a guy over her shoulder).

Guy:
 Oh, that's wonderful Mary, you're doing great with your braille.

Mary:
 (Putting book down on the table) I couldn't have done it without you Paul.

Paul:
 (Gets out of chair) Why don't you go to bed and get some sleep, honey. (Paul walks ahead of her as Mary takes book and exits right. Paul mentions for the others to shush as he walks past Mary and uses his foot to move a wooden stool into her way of walking. She falls and trips over it).

Paul:
 Honey, (Helps her up) you remember where the stool was. (he walks ahead of her as she continues walking in a diffrent direction. The two kids and mother are holding in laughter. Paul picks up a broom with a pan on the end attached to it and holds it in front of Mary. She walks into it and hurts her head). Oh Mary, Mary, you're in the kitchen sweetheart, you're all disoriented. Let me help you. (Spins her around as the mother and kids smile) The ladder's right here. (Mother and kids hold in laughter again).

Mary:
 (Heading up ladder) Thanks Paul. (He kisses her as she walks up the ladder, which he moves over to the window at the top of the barn. She falls out the window and crashes into something outside. The others are laughing at her. Cut back to Peter and family).

Peter:
 (Fairly serious) Geez, life was a lot tougher back then.

Lois:
 Listen up everybody. It's time for spring cleaning.

 Meg and Chris:
 (At the same time) Spring Cleaning!? Oh not again! (Notices they're all talking in unison) That was weird. Boy, that was weird too.

Lois:
 If we all pitch in we'll be done in no time.

Peter:
 Lois, you known I swore I'd never clean again. Not after Boundy dropped me as their spokesman (Flashback to Peter in a yellow painted kitchen, dropping liquid on a table counter while a woman holds up the Bounty product). Wait a second, Rosie, I've just pourn this glass of warm yellow liquid on the counter and you're telling me that Bounty can pick it up in 5 seconds?

Rosie:
 (Notices liquid) What is this?

Peter:
 (Looks at watch) Four seconds.

Rosie:
 Is that-

Peter:
 Three seconds.

Rosie:
 It smells like-

Peter:
 (Points to liquid) Clean my pee! (Flash back to the Griffin's house. Meg sits up on the floor).

Meg:
 Mom, I can't clean, I've got stuff to do.

Lois:
 Sweetheart, we know you don't have any stuff to do. (Moves on hand palm side up in the air) Now I don't want to hear any more excuses from anyone.

 Chris:
 (In unison again) Ah crap. (Notices they're in unsion again) We did it again! (Wait a few seconds and look at each other) Ruth Bader-Ginsberg! (Eyes squinch up) Ooooohhhh!

Lois:
 Ahh, look Meg, it's your little baby booties (pulls them out of chest), oh and your little bronze hat (pulls that out of chest as well) and your tail (pulls tail out. Meg's eyes go wide).

Meg:
 My What!? (Turns around to Lois)

Lois:
 Nothing. (Puts tail back in chest and shuts it. Shot of Peter, Chris and Cleavland near a fire hydrant. Chris is holding a wrench and standing next to Cleveland and Peter is holding a piece of paper out).

Peter:
 Okay, Lois's list says clean the windows, clear the gutters, and wash the siding (Moves hands to waist) Now for most folks (moves his right hand up) that's three chores (points at guys) but to Peter Griffin and his big hose it's one. (attaches a hose that was previously off camera to the hydrant)

Cleveland:
 Oh, you're not working hard Peter. (Peter moves with the hose right in front of the hydrant preparing to turn it on) You're working (?) smart. (Moves to the street pavement right before the sidewalk in front of his house and calls back).

Peter:
 Hey Chris, give me the juice. (Chris uses wrench to turn screw on hydrant around. A gush of water comes out of the hose which Peter moves to the top window of his house. The water breaks the window and Peter moves the hose right knocking some of the covering on his house. Shot of Brian using a vaccum to clean another room. He moves on top of a table, which is immediatly blasted by the gush of water. Brian is knocked off camera. You can now see Peter still spraying the water with his hose outside as Chris turns the water off by turning the wrench the other way. The water steadily dies down and Peter starts smiling).

Lois:
 (From inside the house calling out a broken window) Peter there's water and glass and it's a diaster in here.

Peter:
 (Still holding hose) Well Lois, why don't you put down your ginger ale and redbook and get to work? (Looks at her sternly) La-zy. (Walks off screen to the left).

Lois:
 You're not helping. Look, don't come near the house. Go do something else (Walks out off camera. Shot of Joe and his son Kevin near their truck. Joe moves his finger to a bag on the driveway).

Joe:
 Son, this duffel bag is only half zipped. (Kevin moves to zip it as Peter, Cleveland and Chris walk on screen).

Peter:
 Hey Joe, where you going?

Joe:
 I'm going camping for the weekend (points to Kevin still zipping up bag) with Johnny Cut corners . (Stops pointing) You guys wanna come along?

Cleveland:
 Hmm, it would be nice to get out of the house. This is the time of the month when Loretta is visited by her Aunt Flo. Loretta likes to personify her mencies in humorous ways. (Shot of Quagmire outside of his house looking at his mail near the mailbox).

Joe:
 (Calling out to him) Hey Quagmire, you up for some camping? (Quagmire's head turns to them and he smiles). Quagmire: Heh, sorry bud. (moves right hand with the mail in it to his side and the other one on his chest) The only tent I'm pitchin' this weekend is... (smile dissapears and he looks uneasy) Well, you see where I'm going with this. (Moves his arms in a fluid downward motion) Oh!

Chris:
 (Looking at Peter) I want to go to Dad. (Looks kind of scared) It will get me away from the evil monkey that lives in my closet. (Cleveland and Peter start laughing at him).

Peter:
 (still laughing) Monkey in the closet… (goes back to laughing with Cleveland as Chris looks worried. Pan to outside his room where a scary looking monkey comes near the window and points at him menacingly and jumps off the window pedestal. Chris looks down depressed. Peter is talking to Joe and Cleveland)

Peter:
 Oh, this is going to be great. Last time I did any male bonding is when me and Cleveland (points to him) went to China Town. (Flashback to Chinatown where a store sign says Chinese Finger Cuffs and then pans down to Peter and Cleveland stuck by finger cuffs by their... penises. The store manager looks at them).

Peter:
 Look (looks at him) forget how it happened, can you just get us out of this?

Stewie:
 I say, Rupert, (looks at him) this paste is quite delicious. It's almost worth the bowel obstruction. (Licks finger and puts down paste bottle. Brian enters the room through a door on the left and looks angrily around the room and then at Stewie).

Brian:
 (Questionly) Are those my books? What the Hell are you doing?

Stewie:
 Paper machíe. (tears out one of the papers) I use them to make the houseboat from Surfside 6. (pan to a repiclia of said house boat) You remember: (starts to sing and move his hands back and forth) Surfside 6! (high pitched voice with finger to his mouth) Who lives there? (regular voice and hands moving again) Surfside 6! (High pitched voice and finger to mouth again) Young bachelors? (Normal voice and hands moving back and forth again) In Miami Beach! (Spreads his hands and arms open horizontally and tilts head upward. Brian points at him).

Brian:
 (Angry) Those are my first editions (Lois enters the room) You little punk! (Brian moves to him and Stewie moves toward Lois who picks him up).

Stewie:
 Momma, doggie's scary!

Lois:
 Brian, have you lost you're mind? He's just a baby. (pats Stewie and turns right) He doesn't know what he's doing (walks off with Stewie who looks at Brian).

Brian:
 This isn't over.

Stewie:
 (Smug) Oh, if you're looking for your doschodoectie I used it used it to make the Fort from F troop. (Lois contiunes to walk into living room with Stewie and looks at him)

Lois:
 Look what I found, Stewie. (holds up letter) An appoinment card. (puts him down on sofa) You've got a checkup. (Stewie holds the card and looks at it)

Stewie:
 Oh, marvelous. A quick weighing (points out) a stick in your tounge and a nice lollypop to cap it all off. (folds letter a bit and looks at Lois) Oh, and remind me to ask the doctor when my other testicle is going to descend. (Shot of the woods as we pan to Peter Joe and Cleveland. Joe and Cleveland are pitching a tent to the ground and Peter's drinking a beer and sitting on a tree stump. Cleveland Junior comes in with a stick).

Cleveland Junior:
 Bang! (Points at Peter) I'm Daniel Boon! I'm a man (Jumps up and down) I'm a big man! (Points stick in other direction) Bang Bang! (Breaks stick in two and looks at it. Drops one half of the stick in his right and and twirls the stick in his left hand). Now I'm Pat Boone. Gonna have a Christmas special with Daniel Willams. (Laughs and runs around in a circle once and then offscreen)

Peter:
 (Breaths in air and exhales) Ah, so beautiful. It's almost as if this world was created espically for me. (Pan to a T.V monitor with him on it with two monitors to the side and the sign A-10112 on top. A hand is touching the monitor with Peter on it as it slowly moves off, and shows two guys, one with a beard and one with a hat. Both of them have microphone head speakers on).

Beard Guy:
 You think he's on to us Christov?

Christov:
 (Now shown with the moon behind them) No, he's an idiot. (Shot of Kevin walking back to camp holding a shovel).

Kevin:
 Dad, I dug the latrine 50 feet out.

Joe:
 (Not impressed) Oh, that's great Kevin, you want a cookie every time you do something right? Get some firewood.

Kevin:
 (makes army salute to Joe) Yes sir! (Walks off camera. Joe turns to Peter smiling).

Joe:
 He's gonna grow up to be quite a man. (Flashforward to Kevin grown up with some attractive blonde woman in bed with him. Women is looking quite pleased while Kevin is looking fairly bored).

Women:
 (Looks up at him) Mmmm, that was incredible Kevin.

Kevin:
 (Looks at her) I'm not here to impress you. (Women starts to look sad as we pan over to Joe looking at them) Am I dad?

Joe:
 Did I say you could rest yet!? (Flash back to present as Peter and Joe look slightly up smiling. Cleveland Junior runs up with some firewood in both hands).

Cleveland Junior:
 I'm Abe Lincoln. I just chopped some wood. (laughs and wood falls to the floor).

Joe:
 (Sternly looks at him) Good for you son. (Cleveland Junior walks off camera and Joe looks at Peter) Hey, where's Chris? I asked him to fill the canteens an hour ago.

Chris:
 (Off camera) Hey dad, look. (Peter and Chris turn to see Chris moving on camera, shirtless and lying on his back) I covered my back with honey and now the ants are taking me home. (laughs as ants drag him off camera).

Peter:
 (Laughs as well and points at Chris) He does the same thing at home with Velveeta and cockroaches. If you turn the light on really fast (Peter raises left hand and moves it over quickly) they slam him right into the fridge. (Shot of outside Dr's Office. The name on the door says Elmer Hartman on it. We see Lois putting down Stewie on one of the waiting room seats, and then sitting down herself. Stewie eyes a magazine to the right of him and picks it up).

Stewie:
 Oh great, Miera Bella. (Pauses and looks at it again) December's Miera Bella. (Tosses the magazine back on the table it was on. Looks at another baby and parent to the left of the magazine. The baby is naked). What's you're story? Get lost on the way to the mourge? Heh, no seriously is that yours? If it is, then bravo. (Shot of Peter, Joe, Cleveland, and Cleveland junior. Peter is holding a tackle box while Cleveland Junior is looking at his dad and Joe is holding a fishing pole).

Cleveland:
 You remember that short lived sitcom, Fish? (Joe puts away the fishing pole in his backpack) They should have put that on before Chips. (The four move out of camera and walk to the river where Chris is sitting on a log with a pencil and paper in his hand) The marketing pratically writes itself.

Joe:
 (Looking at Chris) Let's go Chris. You're dinner isn't going to catch itself.

Chris:
 I don't wanna go (continues drawing) I had a bad experience with a fish once .(Flashback to Chris's room. Just as he enters it he looks to his fish bowl and see's his fish is gone. He looks under the fishfood and see's a watertrail, that goes all the way to the window, which is partily broken) Oh my god, my fish is gone! (Looks to his piggybank and see's nothing there as well) And he robbed me! (Flashforward to the present)

Peter:
 Okay, see you Chris.

Joe:
 Peter, this is none of my business, but you're turning you're boy into a slacker.

Peter:
 How dare you call my parenting into questioning! If you were a woman I'd slug you.

Joe:
 I'm just saying you should teach him some responsibility.

Peter:
 Alright. (Looks over at Chris) Hey Chris, you are responsible (walks over to him) for guarding the camp while were fishing.

Chris:
 Got it dad. You can count on me to- (falls asleep in mid sentence).

Peter:
 (Looks at others and then taps Chris to wake him up) Chris, pay attention. I want you to (also falls asleep mid sentence, and so does Chris again. Shot of Doctor Hunter's office where Stewie has stripped naked and Dr. Hunter is examining Stewie with his stethoscope).

 Hunter:
 Alright, take a deep breath Stewie. (Moves strethroscope to Stewie's stomach. Stewie laughs and pushes it away).

Stewie:
 Cold! Cold! (Stops laughing) Okay, okay, I'm fine, I'm fine. (Dr Hunter puts strethropscope back on Stewie's stomach. Stewie breaths through his nose once and looks at the doctor) Ah! Tell me Dr Hartman do all the children fall in love with you? (Dr. Hunter looks at him and Stewie starts laughing again) That's cold, that's cold. (Dr. Hunter picks him up and puts him on the scale).

Hunter:
 Hmmm, 29 pounds. (takes out pen and writes something down) That's big for your age.

Stewie:
 (Looks at him sternly) Well, forgive me for not being one of those aneroxic babies from the diaper commericals. (Dr Hunter picks him up and puts him back on the table as the nurse comes in carting a metal rolling table with a package of wooden tounge depressors on it).

Dr Hunter:
 Alright little guy, time for you're immunizations.

Nurse:
 (Talking to Lois) You might want to hold him.

Stewie:
 (Looks at Lois) Hold me for what? (Looks shocked as the nurse hands the Doctor a needle. Lois comes over and touches his arms) What the deuce?

Lois:
 (Looks at him) Oh, I'm sorry sweetie. (Stewie struggles out of her grip and runs on the table the nurse brought in, takes one of the tounge depressors and holds her by the neck with the tounger depressor in a sliting throat position).

Stewie:
 Back off! Don't come any closer or I'll cut her! (Looks at the tounge depressor he's holding) I'll... I'll... give her a series of splinters... that could um... you know... become infected! (Lois walks up holding a blue kitty puppet in her left hand).

Lois:
 Look Stewie, look at the dancing kitty. (Continue to walk towards Stewie).

Stewie:
 Oh ho ho, no I'll not be taken in by one of your (Lois stops walking. Stewie's attitude changes and he becomes content with the kitty) Oh my, that's delighful, isn't it, what's your name, (Dr. Hunter sneaks up behind Stewie with the needle) you little- (sticks him with it) Ahh! Ahh God! (Shot of the sun in the sky setting as we pan down to see Peter, Joe, and Kevin. Peter is drinking in one boat and Joe and Kevin are in another).

Peter:
 (Looking outward) They call this the magic hour. The day's not quite gone, but the night's not quite here, and somewhere Scott Baio is plowing a woman he dosen't love. (Kevin's line begins to snag and he pulls on it).

Kevin:
 I got one, dad! (Pulls line up fully and we see the fish has escaped).

Peter:
 (Chuckles a bit) Heh heh, looks like that's the one that got away.

Joe:
 (Pulls out a gun) The hell it is. (Holds gun out and looks at Kevin). You get in there (hands gun to Kevin) and kick that fish's ass! (Kevin get's up and jumps out of the boat. Joe crosses his arm and looks down at the water. Then aside he says) God, I love him. (Shot of Cleveland Junior running by, along with Joe being wheeled by Kevin and Cleveland and Peter).

Cleveland:
 I can't believe how terrible the fishing was.

Peter:
 Yeah all we got was this tire, a boot, a tin can and this book of cliches (holds up book).

Joe:
 Well, thank God we came prepared. We brought enough food to last us- (The guys reach camp and are shocked to see it a total mess with the food being taken out of the cooler. Chris is standing next to the turned down cooler on the right and Cleveland Junior on the left).

Peter:
 Holy crap! (Raises arms slightly up) Chris what the hell!? I put you in charge of the food.

Chris:
 (Runs over to Peter with sketchbook) The raccoons were here (opens up book and we see a drawing of the food) see? (In flipbook fashion, Chris turns the pages as drawn raccoons appear in the book) Oh, we're a bunch of sneaky little animals. (drawn raccons knock over food) We're going to wreck this food and eat it (do so) because we're naughty (raccoons surround the tent. Chris comes out) And then there's a guy. Let's get him in trouble with his dad. (Chris laughs as drawn Chris says look at the raccoons)

Joe:
 Somehow I'm less then surprised.

Chris:
 (Looks down at ground) I'm sorry dad. I messed up the entire trip.

Peter:
 Ah it's not you're fault Chris. I failed you as a father. From now on Joe will be you're father. (Joe shakes his head no) Cleveland? (Cleveland also shakes his head no. We pan to a elk on the right).

Elk:
 I'll teach the boy. Come my son, I'll show you the ways of the herd- (sound of gunfire heard as a hunter shoots the elk and him and his two buddies carry him offscreen)

Peter:
 (Looks at dead elk, then looks at ground) Ah crap.

Scene:
 At the Griffin's house at night, Peter and Lois's bed. We see some form in the bed as Lois enters in her nightgown and robe)

Lois:
 Peter, why are you sitting with the sheets over you're head?(pulls off sheets to reveal a collection of skeleton heads. Lois screams and Peter enters from the left) Peter, what's wrong?

Peter:
 (Looks at her) Is it that obvious?

Lois:
 (Takes one of the skulls and puts it in the closest) Well you always do the skull gag when you're depressed. (picks up another one and holds it) Talk to me.

Peter:
 Well, it's just I'm trying to teach Chris how to be a man, you know. First I tried teaching him how to eat an oreo. (Holds his hand out. We flashback to Chris and Peter in the kitchen with a plate full of oreos between them).

Peter:
 (picks up an oreo) The way to eat an oreo is to twist it (twists the oreo) pull it apart (does so) and lick it (licks the left half of the oreo once). Now you. (Chris picks up the oreo and smacks it against his head, falling unconcious. Flash to the present again where Peter is sitting on the bed) Then I'd try teaching him how to get out of paying a check.

Waiter:
 Oh, I'm terrribly sorry sir. Of course you're soup is grathus. (Waiter walks out off camera. Pan over to Chris on the other side). Peter looks at him).

Peter:
 Now your turn. (Chris takes a seemingly naked dead guy from under the table and places his face on the soup. Chris points to the waiter).

Chris:
 Waiter, there's a dead guy in my-(the seemingly dead guy moves his face out the soup and is looking around afraid. He starts screaming. Chris takes the wine bottle and keeps bopping the guy over the head with it. Peter looks shocked and crawls off camera to the right. Flash back to the present where Peter is standing up and Lois is siting on the bed)

Lois:
 Peter, you can't force feed maturity. He needs to learn it on his own. (Gets up and takes off her night robe) Why don't you get her a job or something?

Peter:
 Woah! (Lois throws the robe to the bed) Freeze Frame! (Lois is frozen in her position and Peter shrugs his shoulders slightly) That's it! (Walks to where the camera would be if this were live action) I can teach Chris responsibility by getting him a job. (Points to Lois) Isn't she great? (Walks back to her) Now you see why I married her. (Faces back towards the camera and makes the leave motion with his right hand). Go away now. I'm gonna do stuff to her. (Exterior shot of Griffin's house at morning time. Brian is sitting on the couch and Lois enter's the shot from the right carrying three books).

Lois:
 I'm sorry Stewie ruined your books. Here, (puts the books down and sits on armrest) I brought you some of Peter's. (Brian takes the first book and looks at the title). Brian: (Reading) Mr. T by Mr. T (puts that book to the left and picks up next book and reads title). T and Me by George Prepard. (Puts that book to pile on the left and picks up the last book and reads the title). For The Last Time, I'm not Mr. T by Bing Rayems. (Clenches fist and shudders. Stewie is now seen in front of the couch looking wobbly and tired).

Lois:
 (Get's up) Oh Stewie are you ok? (Walks over to him).

Stewie:
 Must we make small talk everytime we pass? (Lois feels his forehead)

Lois:
 Ooh, you're burning up. Must be a reaction to the shots. I'll get you some baby asprin (walks off camera).

Stewie:
 (Get's up and looks in the direction she was walking in). What the devil are you talking about? You said the shots were suppose to make me healthly. (Brian looks over, smiles, and begins to laugh).

Brian:
 (Points to him) You actually believe Lois had them inject you with something to make you healthy? I, I mean you were already healthy right?

Stewie:
 Oh god, you're right! I was as pink as a pistol! (Brings hands toward mouth and realizes what he just said) Pink as a pistol? (Moves hands down) Good Lord, I can't even form a cojent (?) (moves hands to face) simile anymore! (Turns to Brian) What was in those needles?

Brian:
 I've already said too much. (Jumps off couch and walks over to Stewie, then past him off camera as we pan to Stewie)

Stewie:
 I should have known. Her treachery knows no limits (takes a step forward) I... I …(begns to stumble while he's walking) Getting dizzy… (stumbles a bit more, brings his head up) Fight it, Stewie… (brings it down. He brings his hand up shaking). You'll not go gentle in that good night… (tilts head forward again and raises hand up) to quote Bob Dylan. (falls down backwards and we pause here. He quickly sits up for a second). No, no Dylan Thomas. (and falls back down. Shot of Quahog golf club driving range as we move to the hitting area and Peter, Joe, Kevin and Cleveland enter).

Peter:
 Boys, I'm a miracle worker. I have used all my parenting skills to change my son from a lazy slacker (points to him on the field picking up balls) to a working man. (Chris gets hit quickly by a lot of balls).

Joe:
 Nice going, Peter.

Peter:
 Yeah, up yours Joe.

Joe:
 What?

Peter:
 Thanks. (Waves to Chris) Hey Chris!

Chris:
 (Waves back) Hey dad! I'm working, I'm workin- (gets hit by golfball right in the chin) ow! (Holds his chin)

Peter:
 (holds left hand cupped to face) Careful Chris, you don't get Dental for 60 days. ( A short man with acne comes on screen).

Short Man:
 (Points to Peter) You that Griffin's boy's father? (uses hand to point to himself) I'm Patty Tanager, the Caddy Manager. Yeah, it rhymes, big woop, wanna fight about it? Listen (extends arms a bit) you're son is the best ball shaggle we ever had. I sold twice as many buckets today because everybody wants to hit the fat kid. (Pan over to a business guy in a red coat talking to someone on his cell phone).

Business Guy:
 Lyn, cancel my afternoon meetings. I-I gotta hit more balls at this fat kid. (Pan over to the guys as Joe looks to Peter).

Joe:
 Peter, you mind if Kevin and I uh-

Peter:
 Nailed Chris? He'd be thrilled. (Pan over to Cleveland Junior, who is on one of the shooting areas and hits a golf ball pretty far.)

Tanager:
 Hey, (points to Junior) this kid here just knocked the ball 300 yards! (people are crowding around Junior as he hits another one far. The people applaud and he jumps up and down)

Cleveland Junior:
 I'm Tiger Woods! I'm Tiger Woods! Whee! (Hits another ball pretty far. Pan back to Peter and Tanager).

Peter:
 Geez Cleveland, your kid's a natural. With a little help he could be a pro.

Cleveland:
 Oh Peter, I can't make Cleveland Junior sit still for anything. Sometimes (pulls his hands out) I wonder if he's got the ephiylepsly. But then I go and see what's on the T.V.

Peter:
 Well, maybe you're not a good a father as me, heh? I mean, (points backwards) look at what I did with Chris. I'm even better then that dad on Lost in Space. (Flashback to Lost in Space set. Dad, kid robot, couple and girl and mother figure are seen in a rocky alien terrain).

LOS Dad:
 We need to gather more information (walks away a bit and stops and but his hands on his hips) on this new planet. (Walks over to couple) Don, you take my 16 year old blonde daughter out in the chariot for the rest of the day. (walks over to the two other females) Penny, you stay here with me. (Walks over to boy and robot). And Will, you and the robot go out into the uncharted wilderness and take this mincing (pan out to reveal older man standing next to robot) boy hungry pedophile with you. (Flash back to present).

Cleveland:
 Cleveland Junior is beyond your skills. He won't respond to you.

Peter:
 Oh yeah? (motions to Cleveland Junior) Hey, hey, come here Cleveland Junior, hey, come to Peter. Cleveland: (also motions to Junior) Over here Cleveland Junior. (at the same time) come on come over here come to papa! (Junior walks over to Peter)

Peter:
 Huh huh? Come on you'll see. I'm gonna turn this kid into the greatest golfer ever.

Cleveland:
 Fine. (Walks off screen)

Tanager:
 How'd you get him to come to you?

Peter:
 (Holds up bottle) With this.

Peter:
 Love.

Tanager:
 Jealousy.

Peter:
 Touch.

Tanager:
 Forever.

Peter:
 Intense.

Tanager:
 Passion.

Both:
 (Whispering it) Obessison. Calven Klien. (Exterior shot of Griffin's house. We have a shot of Stewie in his bed, Lois looking worried standing next to him, and Brian reading a book on a chair on the left of Stewie's crib).

Lois:
 (Hands him cup of water) Drink this honey, it will bring your fever down. (He drinks a bit of it). I'm going to run you a cool bath. (walks off screen. Stewie waits until she's out of his line of vision and spits out the water).

Stewie:
 She's one of them, I'm sure of it. (Turns to Brian) Now tell me what they injected me with. (Brian is still reading book without looking up).

Brian:
 Huh, did you know Mr T. always wanted to be a broadway dancer?

Stewie:
 (curls fist up and puts them in the air) Answer me damn it! (Looks at him again) What have they done to me? (Brian looks away from the book and at Stewie).

Brian:
 Look (Get's off chair and holds book to the side) it could be any number of things. Gene manipulation, sterizillation. (Stewie is shocked)

Stewie:
 Not my seed!

Brian:
 (Looks at him closely) But from the look on you're pupils, I'd say it's some kind of mind control syrum. (pauses for a second then walks away smiling). Or not. (Stewie goes to the mirror in his crib and looks at himself).

Stewie:
 Mind Control? (Looks away) But I feel so lucive. (Mirror Stewie looks at him).

Mirror Stewie:
 Yes, you look spot on to me.

Stewie:
 Oh, why thank you. I try to work out.

Mirror Stewie:
 Oh, but who has the time (makes his hand a fist and moves it across a bit) besides trophy wives? (Stewie laughs at this).

Stewie:
 (Looking away from mirror) Yes that's rich. (Suddenley realizes who he's talking to (himself), shuts the mirror, and throws it at his cradle spinning toy ( a bunch of airplanes) that Stewie watch spin around and around and then turn into birds. A shocked Stewie sees the birds flock all across the room, and land right beside him on his doors and tables. The birds head then become those of Mr. T. )

 T Bird:
 Didn't want to be a mean guy. Wanted to be a dancer (T- Bird raises wing, which signals the other birds to raise theirs, and soon they begin to dance around Stewie, who looks away and then grab onto the rail of his crib).

Stewie:
 Go away! (Makes shoong motion and falls off the crib and lands into some sort of ocean. He sinks and then resurfaces as the ocean begins to grow dark and the sky turns a purple magenta style of color. A giant fin appears in the water, which is revealed to be a Giant Lois Nose, that Stewie finds himself on, as it surfaces above the ocean and onto a black screen). YOU!

Giant Lois:
 I am taking your brain. (looks at him sideways) You are now my slave.

Stewie:
 Nooooooooo! (Falls off the nose and in to the sky, which is now purple magenta again, and falls into the ocean again. Regular Lois and Meg appear).

Meg:
 Why is freaking out like that?

Lois:
 Oh, he's having a little hallucination from the fever (A shot of Stewie in the tub, struggling against the water is shown). Just like when you were 3 and you accidently ate those adult brownies I was saving for the Doobie Brothers concert. (Shot of Golf Course again, as we see Chris taunt the hitters by making faces at them, then turning around as the balls hit, being protected by a giant pillow wrapped around his back. Laughs at them again as we see Cleveland Junior (with golf club) and Peter, on the course).

Cleveland Junior:
 I'm gonna be on a cereal box! (Jumps up and down) Honeycomb pig! (turns around) Yeah Yeah Yeah! (turns around again) It's not small. (Turns around again) No No No!

Peter:
 (Puts hand on Junior's arm) Alright, now pay attention, junior. Now you wanna keep your shoulders straight (demonstrates this) and you're knees bent (demonstrates this as well). And, uh, (close up on the two) just once, uh, for me, would, would you call me Mr. Drummond?

Tanager:
 Hey, Griffin down here! (Chris looks at him as he opens it all the way) Yeah it's a secret tunnel like in Hogan's Heroes, no big woop (makes fists) wanna fight about it? (takes check out of shirt) Anyway here's your first week's pay.

Chris:
 (Takes the money and holds it in the air) All right Chris! (Runs up to Peter and Junior who are boarding a golf cart) Dad! Dad, look-

Peter:
 (Waves to him) That's great Chris, but I'm trying to be a good father here. (looks at junior) I'm real proud of you champ, let's get a milkshake.

Cleveland Junior:
 You got it Mr. Drummond. (The two drive off as Chris waves at them, looking sad. A shot of the exterior of Quagmire's house, as a young blonde female wearing a mail outfit comes to the door and rings it. Quagmire answers in nothng but his boxers.)

Mail Girl:
 Package for Glen Quagmire. (Quagmire turns his head slowly and looks at her)

Quagmire:
 Oh, uh excuse me. (Goes back inside and closes door. Opens door wearing nothing). I've got a package for you too. All Right! (Mail Girl takes mace out of her pocket and sprays it at him, but it dosen't effect him) Nice try, but I've built up an immunity. (Quagmire puts a robe on as the girl exits and drives off in the express car she came in. He runs past Chris, who is sitting on the sidewalk, looking sad. Quagmire notices him.) Hey, what's wrong kid?

Chris:
 My dad doesn't care about me anymore.

Quagmire:
 Oh, well. (takes one hand out of robe pocket and kind of points at Chris) Hey, at least you had a dad. When I was growing up, it was just me and my mom. (Flashback of baby Quagmire and his mom. Baby Quagmire is crying).

s Mom:
 Oh, look's like somebody's hungry. (Lifts up shirt and prepares to breast feed him. Baby Quagmire looks at this).

Baby Quagmire:
 All right. (Sucks on the breasts a bit before we flash back to the present, where Chris is in Quagmire's house and Quagmire has changed his clothes into a white pants , white shirt, tan jacket get up).

Chris:
 I just wanted him to be proud of me. (Quagmire enters from the back room) I even got a job.

Quagmire:
 Well there's your problem. Jobs are for suckers. You just need to know how to have a good time. (Grabs him by the arm) Come on. (Cut to Quagmire and Chris in his car (his bumper license is Bushman) driving until they see a blonde woman on the left side of the street. Quagmire pulls over and looks at Chris). Go ahead kid, try it out.

Chris:
 Uh, excuse me you dropped something. (looks to see if she dropped something) My jaw. (She looks disgusted at him) Heh heh, heh oh right. (Quagmire drives off)

Quagmire:
 Heh, nice going. (he doesn't notice they're driving into a metal pole, and they end up smacking into it and activating the air bags: which are two blowup dolls that put their thong right by your face). Heh, all right.

Chris:
 (At same time) All right.

Quagmire:
 Oh! (A trio squad of females applaud his strike and he bows and blows a kiss to them. One of the girls (the short black haired one) ties up her bowling shoes and walks onto the alley, putting her regular shoes in her bag. Quagmire takes the bag and takes out the shoe (a pink pump) and sniffs it). Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhohooh! (Passes it to Chris, who sniffs it).

Chris:
 Oh. (Shot of them driving along a path) I don't think I like feet as much as you do.

Quagmire:
 (Notices something) Hey, everybody likes feet. Come on the party's just starting.

Beach People:
 (Singing and dancing on surf boards) I'm gonna grab my girl and head to the beach (The word Hic appears on screen) Hic-a-doo-la! (as do a doo and la) We're gonna all hang ten (shot focuses on female thong) and maybe then Hic-a-doo-la (The words appear on the screen again).

Guys:
 (While holding surfboards with three girls on them) Cause I'm a Hic-a-doo-la guy.

Girls:
 And I'm a Hic-a-doo-la girl.

Guys and Girls:
 And together it is a Hic-a-doo-la world. Hic-a-doo-la! (Words appear on screen) (Shot of Chris and Quagmire dancing on surfboard's with a female).

Chris:
 Mr. Quagmire, what does Hic-a-doo-la mean? (Everyone stops and looks at Chris)

Everyone:
 What does Hic-a-doo-la mean?

Beach Guy One:
 Well, Hic-a-doo la's the special feeling you get from holding hands with you're best gal.

Beach Girl One:
 It's cheering real loud for the home team!

Beach Guy Two:
 It's hitting the perfect wave!

Adult Beach Goer:
 (Who looks like he's going to go sailing) It's obeying all the rules (The group of kids look at him)

Group Of Kids:
 No Way! (The camerea goes back and forth with a crazy sound affect. The Group of kids grab him and run with him to the ocean (in one shot they seem to be going backwards, but then go forwards again, then back again, then forward, then back, then finally forward) and throw the guy into the sea. He spits up some water and looks at the kids. Shot over to Brian and Chris, each with a beach girl.)

Quagmire:
 Hey, are we in Tieminamn, (Bobs his head back and forth) 'cause I see a square.

Peter:
 Ah, great shot, Cleveland Junior.

Junior:
 Thanks Mr Drummond.

Peter:
 Listen, uh, for today, can you call me Mr. Popadopolis?

Junior:
 You got it (Sinks in another ball).

Peter:
 (Folds his hands a bit) And would ya hate me if I called you Webster?

Junior:
 (Looks at him angrily) That's the line!

Peter:
 Oh, sorry. (Tom Tucker comes from off screen right).

Tom Tucker:
 Hi, Tom Tucker, local news anchor and on my days off, golf enthuaist. You know the club's having a man-boy golf tournament and you two should enter.

Peter:
 A tournament huh? (Scratches his chin) That gives me an idea (Motions for Tom) Come on, I'll explain in the car. (Peter and Tom run to Peter's car. They shut the door and Peter opens his hand) This is the perfect way to show my friends what a great father figure I've been to Cleveland Junior. I'll do it! (They exit the car. A shot of a strip club with the sign Fuzzy Clam and a door man as we see young ladies riding the poles and Chris and Quagmire just entering).

Chris:
 Where should we sit?

Quagmire:
 Uh, that's not up to me kid. (Points at his pants) I follow the old divining rod.

Stripper One:
 How old are you? (goes to touch Chris's cheek)

Chris:
 Old enough to know you're a whore. (She pulls him off to the right. Meanwhile, another stripper (blonde this time) is by Quagmire, wearing a coat which she quickly takes off.)

Quagmire:
 Woah! (As he says this, money falls out of his pockets. She then turns and removes her skirt) Woah hah hah! (More money falls out as she shakes it for him) Woah hah hah hah hah hah! (Meanwhile, stripper one is on one of the poles, her butt to Chris)

Stripper One:
 Come on, (smacks her butt) talk to me, sweetie. (bends over with her head between her legs) You look a little down. (then pulls her head back up)

Chris:
 I always thought I'd go to my first nudie bar with my dad, but he doesn't have time for me.

Stripper One:
 Well, Sweetie (faces other way) part of growing up is learning adults aren't perfect. (closeup of face as she starts to take her top off and swings it a bit). Come on, your dad deserves another chance.

Chris:
 Wow! You are smart (Back at Quagmire, he's staring at Stripper Two and pulls out his wallet) Heh heh, all right. (realizes nothing's there) No, no it's not alright. I'm out of cash. Hey, do you take bank cards?

Quagmire:
 Can I get stamps too? (She slaps him. Shot of The Man-Boy Tournament, as Tom is in the foreground and Peter in crew are in the background).

Tom:
 We're here at the 17th hole where Peter Griffin and Cleveland Junior are 5 strokes ahead, making victory all but a certainty. (Is shown peeing behind a bush and walking off. Junior sinks another hole, and the people slightly cheer).

Peter:
 I told ya I could mold your son into champion. He's gonna be my greatest victory ever, except for the time I defeated my evil twin. (Flashback to top of city building, where Lois is holding a gun in front of two Peters.)

Peter:
 (Pats Cleveland Junior) One more hole and that man-boy trophy is ours. Here you go little buddy. (Tosses him the golfball, which he knees back and forth like a soccer player).

Junior:
 Hey, look at me, I'm Pelle, I'm Pelle! (laughs and runs away from the tournament) Goal! (Laughs some more and is now out of sight).

Peter:
 What the hell's he doing? (The others laugh at him).

Cleveland:
 He's gone. Maybe you better stick to looking after you're own son. (they laugh again and walk out to the right. Peter gives a sad face. Cut to at night and Peter is hitting balls at the pratice spot. He looks right and sees Chris enter, carrying a basket of balls. Peter moves one over as Chris takes a shot. Peter scoots over another spot and turns around, hitting the balls at the parking lot now, breaking a car window and setting of an alarm. Chris smiles and turns around too, and hits another ball, this time at a lady. Peter moves over a spot).

Guy:
 (Offscreen) Oh my god!

Brian:
 I'm in a rut. Nothing thrills me anymore. I mean, I can't even think of a reason to get off the bed in the morning.

 Kaplan:
 Really?

Brian:
 You want to know how pathetic my life is? I've seen that Behind the Music with Leif Garrett 18 times.

Friend:
 Hey uh, hey, Leif. It's been a while.

Leif:
 Too long, man. I'm so sorry about everything, man. I'm so...

Friend:
 You ready for a bombshell? You saved my life that night.

Leif:
 But-but I was driving.

Friend:
 I was on a road to destruction, man. The accident may have crippled me, but I'm alive, aren't I?

Leif:
 Can we turn off the cameras, dude?

Brian:
 It's like, it's like I'm, I don't know, trapped in my own life.

 Kaplan:
 Well, Brian, you may be too inwardly focused. Try thinking about the needs of others for a change. Why don't you do some volunteer work?

Brian:
 That makes sense. Volunteer work. Thanks, Bruce.

 Kaplan:
 You still have 13 more minutes.

Brian:
 Oh. Do I? Hmm. I notice you got a new receptionist. Nice little body on her, huh?

 Kaplan:
 That's my daughter.

Brian:
 Well, we could probably call this an early day, huh?

 Weed:
 Attention, everyone. Due to several complaints and two deaths related to worker fatigue, I have decided to throw a company picnic this Saturday.

Peter:
 Hey, Derek, how are you getting to the picnic?

Derek:
 I don't know. I don't have a ride.

Peter:
 Hey, John, you got a two-seater, don't you? Hey, Derek, maybe you go with John? Huh?

Derek:
 For the last time, I'm not gay!

John:
 Thanks anyway, Peter.

Peter:
 Hey, we'll get him.

Brian:
 Here. Right this way. Watch your step. Okay, they're in the woods. The camera keeps on moving. I think they're looking for some witch. I don't know. I wasn't listening. Nothing's happening. Nothing's happening. Something about a map. Nothing's happening. It's over. A lot of people in the audience look pissed.

Meg:
 Now, remember, Chris we have to work together, so that our steps... [screams]

Peter:
 Aw, this is my favorite event, "Catch the Greased Up Deaf guy."

 Weed:
 Go!

Deaf guy:
 You're never gonna catch me! You're wasting your time! Forget about it! Go do something else! See you all next year!

Brian:
 King me.

Elderly woman:
 I don't want to play anymore. The pain. I can't live like this, Brian. I need you to pull the plug.

Brian:
 I-I can't.

Elderly woman:
 Be my angel and set me free. Please? [Brian goes for the plug] Oh, my God! You were really gonna do it! Nurse, this dog is trying to kill me! Nurse!

Brian:
 You are twisted, lady! You hear me? You are screwed up in the head!

 Weed:
 The winner of our final contest will receive a very special prize. A week's paid vacation!

Peter:
 Did you hear that? Oh, God, please, let it be farting. Please let it be a fart contest.

 Weed:
 These are tranquilizer darts. I have enough here to take down Robert Downey Jr. Robert Downey-yes, well, the last one left standing wins. Let the game begin!

Lois:
 Go, Peter!

Stewie:
 Look at him! He runs like a Welshman. Doesn't he? Doesn't he run like a Welshman?

Joe:
 Hey there, Brian.

Brian:
 Hi, Joe. Hey, Bonnie making chicken marsala tonight?

Joe:
 No. She made that three nights ago. Wow, that's some nose you got!

Brian:
 Yeah. One time it almost got me a spokesman deal.

Toucan Sam:
 Follow your nose. Follow your nose. Follow your nose.

Brian:
 [snickers] I'm sorry. No, that was good. I just didn't think you were gonna go so cartoony with it.

Toucan Sam:
 Well, how would you read it?

Brian:
 I don't know. I was thinking of doing it, you know, good, like an actor. But, you know, your way's good, too.

Joe:
 You know, we could use a nose like that down at the precinct.

Johnson:
 I guess it's just down to you and me, Peter. One of us is gonna win that paid vacation.

Peter:
 I don't want to feed Grandma bacon while she's in the bathtub.

Johnson:
 Peter, are you okay?

Johnson:
 Mr. Weed, I think Peter needs a doc-oof!

 Weed:
 We have a winner!

Peter:
 Here, kitty, kitty.

Brian:
 No drugs. She's good. He's clean.

Joe:
 It looks like that's it, except for the flight crew.

Quagmire:
 Hey, Brian. What's with the Johnny Law routine?

Joe:
 Say hello to our newest narc. He's a natural.

Quagmire:
 Oh, yeah? How good are you?

Brian:
 You're back from Manila. You had lumpia for dinner. Then you made love to two Filipino women...and a man.

Quagmire:
 You mean three Filipino women! ...No!

Brian:
 Wait a second. Got something.

Joe:
 This could be the real deal, boys! Let's do it!

Joe:
 Don't move, dirt bag!

Brian:
 It's coke! Yes! All right, we've got him! This is great. Ah, this is the rush I've been looking for.

Joe:
 Good work, Brian. You still got a little...

Brian:
 Oh, oh. Thanks.

Lois:
 So, Peter. Where shall we go for your week off?

Peter:
 I was thinking we could all go to purgatory, like we did last year.

Lois:
 This isn't bad. It's not that good. But it's not that bad.

Brian:
 It's so-so.

Peter:
 More or less.

Peter:
 Hey, Brian. If cops are pigs, does that make you a Snausage?

Brian:
 Clever, Peter. Did you stay up all night writing that?

Peter:
 I got to bed around 2:00, 2:30.

Brian:
 Do you know what Joe said the street value of that cocaine would've been?

Lois:
 Let's see. Four and a half kilos uncut Nicaraguan...$1.7 mil, that area?

Brian:
 Uh, yeah. That's right.

Meg:
 You guys! Brian's famous!

Lois:
 You're a hero!

Peter:
 Way to go, pal!

Brian:
 Oh, come on. Stop it, you guys. It's nothing, really. Lois. Your toast is ready.

Lois:
 Oh, my.

Brian:
 Meg's using a new conditioner.

Meg:
 He's right!

Peter:
 How do you like that?

Meg:
 That's amazing.

Brian:
 And it's time to change Stewie.

Stewie:
 That's preposterous. I haven't...oh, there it is. All right.

Brian:
 Stop the car! Over there. Everybody freeze! This is a bust!

Joe:
 Brian, this is a Sunday School class.

Brian:
 The hell it is! Pure Bogota bullion. This is a drug ring.

Joe:
 But these are just kids.

Brian:
 Oh, yeah? What's your name?

Ricky:
 Ricky.

Brian:
 They're not kids-they're midgets! Filthy, drug-peddling midgets!

Joe:
 Oh, my God! Look out, Brian!

Joe:
 Nice work, rookie.

Brian:
 Huh, thanks. But the real hero here is God for blessing me with this nose...and a few other equally amazing appendages.

Joe:
 Well, I'd better take this cocaine down to Evidence.

Brian:
 Hey, I'll do that. I'll catch up with you guys at the pub.

Lois:
 So it's settled. We're taking a cruise to the Bahamas!

Peter:
 Ah, this is gonna be great. Cruises are the best.

Lois:
 And look. It says we have our choice of cabins, port or starboard. Ha! Listen to me. I sound like an old salt.

Stewie:
 [Stewie laughs sarcastically] Yes, though I must say, I've always dreamed of a life at sea.

[Comic operetta music] Stewie:
 â™ª I'm the greatest captain of the Queen's navy â™ª

Sailors:
 â™ª And your record will stand as proof â™ª

Stewie:
 â™ª Be it galley or a freighter, I'm an expert navigator â™ª

Sailors:
 â™ª And you're also a world-class poof â™ª

Stewie:
 â™ª My manner, quite effete, is mistaken on the street â™ª â™ª For a sailor who can pirouette on cue â™ª â™ª Well, despite your point of view, I can thrill a girl or two... â™ª â™ª But I'd rather get it on with you â™ª

Brian:
 Sorry to be tardy to the party.

Meg:
 Wow, Brian. Have you lost weight? You gotta tell me your secret.

Brian:
 Here's a hint, put down the fork! Face!

Lois:
 So how was your day?

Brian:
 My day? Un-freakin'-believable! First, we nailed this bastard who hid his stuff in his daughter's doll! Her doll, for God's sake! Where's the line anymore? Well, I got news for you. It's not even on the radar screen! The days of decency and virtue are gone, honey! Bam! Freakin' evaporated, like a dingy, stinkin' mud puddle. One day you see your reflection in it and the next day, it's a damn oil spot on your cracked driveway, staring back at you, mocking you-blah blah blah-knowing the perverted truth that rots in the pit of your soul. That's how my freakin' day was.

Peter:
 You know what I haven't had in a while? Big League Chew.

Brian:
 So take it from me, McGriffin the Drug Dog, if you really want to get high, it's as easy as being yourself. Well, kids, I'm gonna pass things off now to...Gerald, the Happy and Abstinent Police Clown.

Gerald:
 Hey, kids! Do you know why I'm happy? Because I'm free of S-T-Ds!

Brian:
 Got milk? [Manic laughter]

Peter:
 Now, Chris, before you go on a cruise, you gotta build up a base tan.

Chris:
 But, Dad, I heard that if you use tanning beds, you can get something called "melanoma."

Peter:
 Oh, that's just fancy talk for "sexified." Now climb in. Hey, what kind of tanning booth is this?

Man:
 Can't you read? Those aren't tanning booths. That whole row is time machines!

Peter:
 Oh, crap! Where the hell is he?

Chris:
 Hey, Dad, I'm in the Bible days. And there's a whole stadium of people clapping for me. Oh, look. My very own lion!

Peter:
 Oh, my God! Huh. Must've got the wrong hat.

Rocky:
 And now, here's something we hope you'll really like.

Joe:
 Brian, there's no smoking in the terminal.

Brian:
 Hey, hey, there's worse things than nicotine, pal! And I'm gonna find 'em.

Horowicz:
 <Irish accent> Ah, patience, lad. It took dear St. Patrick more than a day to clear the Emerald Isle of snakes.

Brian:
 Can the Irish crap, will you, Horowicz?

Horowicz:
 <American accent> Okay.

Brian:
 Open it!

Man:
 Let me go! Help! Help!

Brian:
 All right. Where's the stash? I'll do a freakin' body-cavity search, I swear!

Joe:
 Sir, we apologize. Griffin, there's no easy way to say this. I think you have a drug problem.

Brian:
 A drug problem? What's this really about? Jealousy? Am I stealing your thunder, Joe, is that it?

Joe:
 Give me your badge.

Brian:
 Fine! By the way, Horowicz, you should show Joe your impression of him.

Joe:
 Ha ha ha ha! Well, I do say that.

Lois:
 Oh, 'The Old Man and the Sea.' I see you're getting in the mood for our cruise.

Peter:
 Yeah. Stupid fisherman. Sitting out there in a boat yammering to himself. He doesn't even know I'm watching him.

Stewie:
 Splendid. Fido McCoke-Fiend is home.

Brian:
 Everybody, this is Tina.

Lois:
 What happened to you?

Brian:
 How about a little less questions, and a little more shut the hell up?

Stewie:
 You know, just because you can't feel your teeth, doesn't mean the girl can't feel your insults.

Lois:
 Hello, I'm Lois Griffin. Welcome to our home.

Tina:
 So, what? She's like your mom or something?

Lois:
 Tina, can I get you a warm washcloth to wipe the dried blood from under your nose?

Brian:
 Here, baby, I'll show you the channel Lois doesn't know about.

Lois:
 Brian will you-Chris, look away! Meg, take Stewie upstairs!

Stewie:
 Wait, wait! That man seems to have suffered a rather serious snakebite!

Lois:
 Brian, would you please ask your new friend to leave now?

Brian:
 Oh, sorry. Things getting a little too real for the Stepford wife? And look at you two. Quasimodo and Lumpy. I leave more personality in tightly coiled piles on the lawn.

Stewie:
 Do me! Do me next!

Brian:
 Come on, baby girl. Let's go to the park.

Brian:
 Doc. What the hell are you doing here?

 Kaplan:
 Your family has something they'd like to say to you.

Meg:
 "Brian, I know I don't speak up much and it's really hard for me to talk about my feelings, but..."

 Kaplan:
 Why don't we start with someone more interesting? Peter?

Peter:
 "Brian, ever since your addiction, you've been a jerk. I miss the good old days when you were my sidekick."

Peter:
 So she hated my tie until I told her it was made out of 100 percent Buttafuoco fiber.

Peter:
 Hey, Brian. How about a little tie music?

Brian:
 [as Paul Shaffer] â™ª Peter's tie, Peter's tie, that's because Peter's the guy â™ª All right. That's it. A little tie music.

Peter:
Yeah!

Brian:
 Look, you guys got it all wrong. I-I-I'm so sorry, everyone! God. I need help!

Stewie:
 Well, I guess now we know what kind of dog he is. A melan-collie. Nothing? Wait. No. I should've said: "Chi-wah-wah." I don't have to f*cking impress you.

Peter:
 Look, I'm not insensitive, Lois. But I just don't see why we gotta cancel our cruise just 'cause the dog's a cokehead.

Lois:
 We're not going on vacation while Brian's in rehab. We'll just have to wait 'till next year.

Peter:
 Aw, man!

Brian:
 Peter, I'll make it up to you. I have a cousin who works at Club Med.

Peter:
 Holy crap! Look at this place. This is where God would come if he had to stop doing blow.

Meg:
 They have tennis courts!

Stewie:
 And a full spa!

Chris:
 Wow! No wonder people do drugs!

Lois:
 Good luck, Brian. I just know you're gonna get clean.

Peter:
 Heck. Shouldn't be too hard to get clean with all these mineral baths and Jacuzzis.

Stewie:
 Oh, I see. The fat man makes a pun, and everyone wets themselves. I give you gold, and I get squat. I'll be in the car.

Doctor:
 That was a very productive first day, Brian. Our goal here is to find your X-factor, the element in your life that made you turn to drugs in the first place.

Brian:
 Well, just having some time away to sort things out is gonna do wonders. Thanks, Doctor.

Brian:
 What are you doing here?

Peter:
 I'm on vacation! Oh, and if anyone asks, I'm also on smack.

Brian:
 Peter, this is a detox clinic. You can't vacation here.

Peter:
 Why not? This place is way better than a cruise. You should've seen it. I whipped a speed freak's ass at horseshoes today.

Brian:
 Peter, this isn't a vacation for me. For God's sake, I'm trying to get healthy!

Peter:
 Yeah, okay, okay. All right. Hey, softball this afternoon. A bunch of us addicts are taking on the pregnant teenagers from across the lake.

Woman:
 Okay, come on, everyone. Exercise is an important part of recovery. Just work with the resistance of the water. Ten more reps. Okay, and one, and two, and three...

Peter:
 Yeah! I'm also addicted to boobies!

Peter:
 I'll trade you this for your cupcake. What? It was just Carpet Fresh. I'm on your side.

Doctor:
 I've been observing your behavior, and I don't think you're a addict. I think you're an idiot.

Peter:
 Well, I don't pay you to think, Hot Lips. In fact, I don't pay you at all. Count it!

Doctor:
 I'll be keeping my eye on you. What's your name?

Peter:
 My name? <spots pea on plate>"Pea...<see girl crying>...tear...<sees the mythological griffin fly by>...Griffin." Yeah, yeah, Peter Griffin. Oh, crap.

Peter:
 Hey, Brian, I was looking for you. Hey, you want to go mess with the pregnant teens across the lake?

Brian:
 I can't. Group therapy, 2:00.

Peter:
 Oh, man, I peeked in on one of those. It was more boring than when I was a security guard for George Harrison.

Peter:
 â™ª Charles in Charge of our days and our nightsâ™ª â™ªCharles in charge of our wrongs and our rights and I sing I want Charles in Charge-â™ª Hey! Hey! Quiet down, up there! You wacky Beatle.

Brian:
 Well, I have been making a lot of progress lately. I guess missing a session wouldn't be the end of the world.

Peter:
 There you go!

Peter:
 Hey, what do you think they put in the bug juice?

Brian:
 Bugs.

Peter:
 No, they don't! Come on! Shut up!

Doctor:
 Well, I hope you're proud of yourselves. 14 premature births!

Brian:
 Sorry, Doc. I don't usually let Peter talk me into this kind of stuff.

Doctor:
 Wait a minute. Brian, you have a pre-existing relationship with this degenerate?

Peter:
 A degenerate, am I? Well, you are a fastizio. See? I can make up words, too, sister.

Doctor:
 Well, I think we found your X-factor.

Brian:
 What? Do you mean Peter?

Doctor:
 His behavior is clearly a negative influence on you. With your intelligence and sensitivity, obviously...

Brian:
 Whoa, hey! I made my own mistakes, all right? This man took me into his home, and he treated me like family. He's my best friend.

Doctor:
 Yes. And look where you've ended up.

Brian:
 You know what? I think my therapy here is complete. I came here to get clean, and I did. So good-bye.

Peter:
 Brian, it's moments like this that make me sad you're gonna die 50 years before I do.

Lois:
 â™ª He was all coked up, and we were choked upâ™ª â™ªBut now we're happy Brian's home, Cha-cha-cha!â™ª

Joe:
 I am serious, Lois. You could be in show business!

Quagmire:
 Hey, Meg. 18 yet?

Meg:
 No.

Quagmire:
 Hey, Chris, how are you?

Chris:
 Well, I'm glad I...

Joe:
 Brian, I feel a little guilty. If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have been exposed to that junk.

Brian:
 Joe, if I've learned anything from my experience it's that we're all responsible for our own destiny. And that's why I'm leaving.

Peter:
 Leaving? You can't leave.

Brian:
 I have to, Peter. For me. I love you all.

Lois:
 Somebody say something.

Stewie:
 Brian, wait!

Brian:
 Hold on a second. [Stewie spits in Brian's face] Airport, please.

Narrator:
 Previously on Family Guy.

Lois:
 Oh, my God! Tell your father not to start the car!

Stewie:
 You want my badge number? Here! Here's my freakin' badge number!

Lois:
 I can't lose this case!

Peter:
 Lois, the case is already over!

Chris:
 [Crying] Who did this to you?

Lois:
 In all my years of research, I've never seen a virus reproduce this quickly.

Lois:
 Everyone I've told about the file is dead.

Meg:
 What do you mean, "Cut the blue wire"? They're all blue wires!

Meg:
 Face it. He's never coming out of that coma.

Lois:
 Brian's gone to Los Angeles to find himself!

Lois:
 Peter, don't throw out Brian's things. It's not like he's gonna be in Los Angeles forever. He just needs to find himself.

Peter:
 He's not coming back, Lois. You saw him. He just walked out on us. Oh, boy, did we have some good times!

Peter:
 Here it comes, buddy! Oh, God! Oh, God! [screaming] What are the odds?

Lois:
 Well, if he does come back, I want everything to be just how he left it.

Stewie:
 Easy! Massage the scalp! You're washing a baby's hair, not scrubbing vomit off your Christmas dress, you holiday drunk!

Meg:
 You guys! We got a letter from Brian!

Stewie:
 Tell him I'm not here.

Lois:
 Let me see.

Lois:
 I'm sorry, sweetie. There. All better?

Stewie:
 You know, you are some piece of work, lady. If you...well, actually, yes, it is.

Lois:
 <reads aloud> "Greetings from California. I've been very busy. Am having a great time trying to make it as a writer in LA. It's just as easy as everyone thinks it is. I've been working the room at a lot of Hollywood parties." Oooh.

Lois:
 Bobby, loved you in Raging Bull. Hey, Jodie, how's the baby? All right. Hey, I need more cheese puffs, Manny. Looks like Oprah's off the wagon again. And skip the toothpicks-she'll just hurt herself.

Waiter:
 Hey, Bri. Did you hear about Jason? Paramount bought his script.

Brian:
 They bought "Death Spares Not the Tiger"?

Waiter:
 100 grand. Pretty good, huh?

Brian:
 Jeez! He's been in LA how long? Unbelievable. You know, he actually called the main character "John Everyman"? Come on. Well, good for him. [Breathes deeply]

Brian:
 Keanu Reeves, wow! I don't usually gush. You'll have to forgive me. But when I was writing "Coast Guard"-that's what I do, I'm a writer-anyway, when I was writing "Coast Guard", I couldn't think of anyone other than...

Brian:
 There's a woodpecker on your head.

Keanu Reeves:
 Yeah, he comes and goes.

Announcer:
 Now back to Kids Say the Darndest Things.

Bill Cosby:
 It's okay. Take your time. Then what happened?

Girl:
 He-he said he would kill me if I ever said anything.

Bill Cosby:
 Do you remember what he looked like?

Girl:
 Yeah. He had a scar on his arm. And he had a big, stupid doo-doo head!

Bill Cosby:
 "A big, stupid doo-doo head!"

Lois:
 Honestly! The things these children come up with.

Announcer:
 If you have a child you'd like to exploit for a trip to Los Angeles why not have them try out for our show? Next auditions will be in New York, Chicago, and Quahog, Rhode Island.

Chris:
 Maybe Stewie could get on that show.

Stewie:
 You must be 'shrooming.

Meg:
 Yeah! We can get a free trip to LA and see Brian.

Peter:
 I haven't been to California since I lived with my other family.

Peter:
 Guys, I just got invited to a party at Sharon Tate's house! You guys can come but you got to promise not to embarrass me.

Stewie:
 Talk, damn you! I know you've been plotting to foil my plans of world domination. Who are you working for? The Libyans? The French? Very well, if torture won't work, perhaps a little tenderness will. Mmm, I like your taste in women. Yes, I think she and I are going to have a good time together. Yes, you like this, don't you? Oh, God! Look at me, having sex with a pig. I've become my father!

Lois:
 Come on, Stewie. Let's get your sailor suit. You got to look cute if you're auditioning for national television.

Stewie:
 Lois, I told you there's no way...national television, you say? Coast to coast? That could be the ideal place to unleash my mass-hypnosis device on the unsuspecting public.

Lois:
 Oh, I always loved this little sailor suit. Or we could do nice corduroys and a sweater.

Stewie:
 Or you can make yourself useful and wipe my button. Circular motion, one finger. And don't you look at me!

Brian:
 Oh, my God, that's Michael Eisner. I'll take it from here, Julio. Here you go, Mr. Eisner. It's been Brian-ized. You might notice that new-script smell. Every car I hand-wash comes with a smile, an air freshener and a copy of my can't-miss coming-of-age teen comedy set in Wisconsin.

Michael Eisner:
 What's your name?

Michael Eisner:
 Let's see. There we go, Brian. See you at Disneyland. Bring money.

Lois:
 Look. It's Tom Tucker from the news, and that must be his son. Oh, my!

Stewie:
 I feel bad staring without having paid for a ticket. I mean really, how am I supposed to follow that act? Bite the head off a chicken?

Jake Tucker:
 Dad, they're staring at me!

Tom Tucker:
 They're just jealous.

Man:
 [shuddering] You're next.

Tom Tucker:
 Wait a minute. Wait, we were next! Hey! Hey, don't walk away from me! Hey! [sighing] You know what we're gonna do? We're gonna get the video camera out and we'll make our own show.

Jake Tucker:
 I don't wanna!

Tom Tucker:
 Yes, you do! You do, because it's normal!

Man:
 Tell us, Stewie, what job does a mommy do?

Stewie:
 Interesting question. More to the point, how does one define "job" without branding oneself with useless labels? [sips coffee] I'm sorry, I'm afraid I answered your question with another question.

Man:
 Um, how old do you think Daddy is?

Stewie:
 42. [Stuttering] Oh, I mean, Daddy's old! I think he's 7!

Men:
 [Laughing]

Stewie:
 Yes, that's it. Yes, that's what you want to hear, isn't it? Yes, jump through the hoop. "Daddy's feet smell!" Jackasses.

Man:
 Mr. and Mrs. Griffin, he's adorable. Congratulations. Stewie's gonna be on the show.

Peter:
 Did you hear that, Lois? We're going to Hollywood! Where the people are sexy and clever and they always say something funny right before the commercial break. [awkward silence]

Man:
 Oh, great. I always end up sitting next to a damn baby.

Stewie:
 What? What did you just say?

Lois:
 Stewie, stop fussing.

Stewie:
 Not now, Lois. Hey, big man, turn around. If you've got something to say, say it to my face! Oh, you can't hear me now? All right, that's it. I was going to watch the movie, but forget it. For the next five hours, you're my bitch. [Crying] My ears are popping, and there's no way to console me! I'm hungry and possibly teething! Maybe I'm wet. Who knows? I'm a baby. [Continues crying]

Man:
 <answering machine> <Jack Nicholson voice> This is a message for Brian. This is Jack Nicholson. Ah, listen, I read your script, and it just, you know, jumped right off the page. I think it's something I'd be excited to be a part of. So, call my... [laughing on machine] <regular voice> Listen, I'm just jacking you, man. Me and my buddy Phil just found your script at Starbucks.

Phil:
 Tell him it sucks!

Man:
 Yeah, it sucks! Give it up, loser! And don't put your number on the cover, you stupid. [Laughing]

Phil:
 I'm hungry.

Brian:
 Jasper's residence.

Peter:
 Who the hell is Jasper? Where's Brian?

Brian:
 Peter? It's me. Jasper's my cousin. I'm using his place while he's working at Club Med. Are you on a cell phone?

Peter:
 Yeah. We're in LA!

Brian:
 What? What a terrific surprise!

Peter:
 Brian, can we see you for dinner? You're not too famous to get together with your old family, are you?

Brian:
 I was invited to the premiere of the new...Val Kilmer picture, but I'd much rather take you guys out to dinner. How about Musso and Frank's, 8:00?

Peter:
 Okay, see you later, Mr. Bigshot. [swallows cell phone] Oh, crap, I didn't push "end." This is gonna cost me a fortune.

Jasper:
 Brian! Okay, I'm back. Tell me everything. I'm sitting, I'm hearing. That's Ricardo. Ricardo, Brian. He doesn't speak any English. Can I? Catching up. Okay, me first. I'm in love. Ooh, too much dressing. He's from the Philippines. I know, I know, I'm a rice queen. So, how's the writing thingy going?

Brian:
 Terrible. I can't even get my foot in the door.

Jasper:
 Oh, okay. I have somebody you have to meet. He's a producer. He's great.

Brian:
 Really? Thanks. That'd be great.

Jasper:
 So, do you like Sex and the City?

Brian:
 Yeah. It's an all right show.

Jasper:
 I wasn't talking about the show. I'm nasty! <foghorn noise> Someone send me out to sea!

Meg:
 It says that this is the actual gutter where the policeman fell over laughing after Eddie Murphy told him he was just giving the transvestite a ride home.

Peter:
 I think that's me. Hello?

Quagmire:
 Hey, Peter, it's Quagmire.

Peter:
 Oh, hey, Quagmire.

Quagmire:
 Guess what? Last night I had sex with a black chick.

Peter:
 I got to go. Sorry.

Black Woman:
 What? All he said was "black chick."

Peter:
 Yeah, I know. But your boyfriend looks like one of your typical angry black guys, and I didn't want to offend him. Hey, we cool, G? Yeah? All right!

Brian:
 I was thinking Halle Berry would be perfect as the camp counselor all the kids want to "get with."

Porn director:
 Jasper was right. You're very talented. You know, I'm having a brainstorm here. Have you ever thought about directing?

Brian:
 Just every waking hour!

Porn director:
 I got this movie. I'm not gonna lie-it's a low-budget movie, but the script is solid. My director dropped out. And I need somebody who's smart, ambitious and not addicted to meth.

Brian:
 I am smart and ambitious!

Porn director:
 [Laughing] Seriously.

Brian:
 No, no. I'm clean.

Brian:
 You know, Musso and Frank's is famous. See the bar over there? Great writers like Hemingway and Faulkner drank there.

Peter:
 Where did that guy who wrote Porky's drink? Oh, man! When that fat broad grabbed that kid's crank through the hole...ah! Where do they get their ideas? Where do they get them? You're the writer. You tell me.

Brian:
 Ah, boy! This is great. All that searching, that emptiness I felt back home, gone. I think I finally found my life's calling, you know?

Lois:
 How wonderful! You know, Brian, I've always found your writing to be a little hackneyed and stilted, but I guess that's why I'm not working out here in Hollywood, huh? Oh, congratulations on all your success.

Brian:
 Uh, thank you. You know what might be a thrill for you guys?

Chris:
 Ooo! Ooo! Eating a pebble!

Brian:
 Yes, but I was talking about stopping by the set to see me in action.

Lois:
 Brian, could we really?

Brian:
 You do know somebody in the business.

Stewie:
 Yes, well, I'm in the business, too. I'm going to be on television.

Brian:
 Great.

Stewie:
 Yes, and when I make my appearance I promise you'll talk about it at the water cooler the next day.

Brian:
 Yeah, well, good luck with that.

Stewie:
 "Yeah, well, good luck with that." Yutz.

Woman:
 I'm trying to reach Peter Griffin.

Peter:
 You're in him.

Woman:
 Mr. Griffin, are you happy with your long-distance service?

Peter:
 Yes, and I'm sick and tired of you people always calling during dinner. I demand to speak to your supervisor.

Woman:
 Hold, please.

Lois:
 Peter, I love this song. Open your mouth.

Porn director:
 Brian, right on time. I like that. Come in. So, ready? Ready to shoot your first scene?

Brian:
 I sure am. Where's the set?

Porn director:
 Second door on your left.

Brian:
 So, this is some kind of shampoo commercial, right?

Porn actress:
 Do I have to sleep with the dog in this one?

Stagehand:
 Hey, can someone fluff Paul? He's got like a windsock thing going on.

Brian:
 So, this is some kind of shampoo commercial, right? Look, Zack, I'm sorry. There's just no way I can do this. I mean, I've been around, you know. I've licked my share of peanut butter. But I just-I think you need to find yourself a new director.

Porn director:
 Are you sure?

Brian:
 I just can't do this.

Porn director:
 Come on, is this any more degrading than washing cars? At least here you can be creative.

Brian:
 Look, I want to make this perfectly clear. There is absolutely no way I would possibly consider doing something like this. [porn actress drops robe] Unless I saw a script first.

Porn director:
 Of course.

Brian:
 You know, this isn't bad.

Porn director:
 It's kind of like Bang the Drum Slowly, except the drum's a chick.

Lois:
 Peter, slow down. Brian said he was gonna be on the set all day. "On the set." Listen to me. Two days in Hollywood, and I sound like a contract player.

Peter:
 Oh, crap! The LAPD!

Lois:
 Come on, Peter, I want to save some tape for the Hollywood sign.

Peter:
 Okay. Thanks a lot, you guys.

Police Officer:
 Our pleasure. Have a nice vacation, sir.

Jenna Jameson JENNA:
 Yes! Yes! Yes! [Heavy breathing]

Brian:
 Cut. Uh, okay. Nice take, Jenna. But let's try giving the lines a little subtext this time. Your husband's always away on business, and you feel increasingly isolated and unloved. So you begin to think maybe you should go back to graduate school and finish your dissertation. And that's when you notice the cable man has taken his pants off.

Peter:
 Wow! A real movie set. Hey, this house looks kind of familiar.

Chris:
 I'll bet Samuel L. Jackson is here. He's in everything. There's Brian!

Brian:
 Samuel, when you lay her down in front of the fireplace I want you to enter from...oh, my God! Hey, you guys!

Meg:
 Hey, Brian? Can I be in the movie?

Porn Producer:
 Well, actually, one of the Jacuzzi girls didn't show up. How long can you hold your breath underwater, sweetie?

Meg:
 Real long. One time at Hatch Pond...

Brian:
 No! Absolutely not! This is a closed set! You gotta leave! Get these people out of here, now!

Peter:
 Oh, what, now that you're a big director, we embarrass you?

Brian:
 No, no! I mean, yes.

Stewie:
 Does anyone else smell Astroglide?

up artist:
 You're gonna look so handsome.

Stewie:
 Look at these crow's feet. My God! You stay up past 7:30, and you pay for it in the morning.

Peter:
 Who the hell does Brian think he is?

Lois:
 Well, maybe he thought we'd get in the way. It wouldn't be the first time you've disrupted a performance.

Peter:
 Oh, jeez! Oh, God! Oh, God! I didn't see it! It jumped right out in front of my car! Oh, I am so sorry!

Lois:
 I think we just have to face it, Peter. Brian's a big-time Hollywood director, and we're just simple, small-town people.

Stewie:
 Um, all right, one more. One more. Rob Lowe.

up artist:
 Straight.

up artist:
 Yes.

Stewie:
 Come on. Stop!

up artist:
 Ho-hum.

Stewie:
 Pull over.

up artist:
 Absolutely.

Stewie:
 Really?

Stewie:
 Oh, well, he hides it well.

up lady:
 Yeah, he wishes.

Bill Cosby:
 "Stewie." That's a funny name, "Stewie." It's like "stew," only with an "eeee" at the end. I meant, it's funny, Stewie. You see, I had an uncle named Stewie, and he used to sell bicycles.

Stewie:
 I'm sorry, aren't you supposed to be asking me a question?

Bill Cosby:
 Stewie, what do you think candy is made out of?

Stewie:
 Sunshine and farts! What the hell kind of question is that?

Bill Cosby:
 I love candy! When I was a little boy, we would play stickball!

Stewie:
 Oh, no. I'll wait. Oh, you finished? I'm sorry. It's my fault, really. I thought the name of the show was 'Kids Say the Darndest Things' not 'Old Black Comedians Never Shut the Hell Up.' Ask me what I want to be when I grow up.

Bill Cosby:
 We also used to play buck-buck.

Stewie:
 Enough of your blather. [dons mind control goggles] Good evening, world. From this moment on, I will be your...

Bill Cosby:
 [Chuckling] What have you got there? You gonna go skiing now?

Stewie:
 Give them back to me! They're of no use to you!

Bill Cosby:
 I'm going down the mountain.

Audience:
 [Laughing]

Stewie:
 No! Don't listen to him! That's not funny! That's just saying what happens when you go skiing!

Bill Cosby:
 Here I go, down the slope. I'm going zip zop...

Stewie:
 Stop it! Stop applauding him! He's not even using real words anymore!

Bill Cosby:
 We'll be back with a little girl from Atlanta who skips rope with her sister's pigtails. [Making ridiculous noises]

Stewie:
 No! My segment's not over!

Bill Cosby:
 Come on, little fellow. You like to jump rope, don't you?

Stewie:
 I-like-jump rope.

Bill Cosby:
 All right. So, you're gonna just sit here and enjoy it.

Stewie:
 I'm gonna sit here and enjoy it. And I like pudding. And Ghost Dad was the best movie I've seen since Leonard Part 6.

Audience:
 [Audience applauding]

Jasper:
 Good news! Good news!

Brian:
 What, more people I love think I'm an arrogant jerk?

Jasper:
 You're more than that Mr. "Nominated for an Adult Movie Award for Best Director."

Brian:
 A Woody? I'm up for a Woody?

Jasper:
 C'mon, call your family. I'll bet they'll be really proud of you.

Brian:
 No, I'd rather they think I'm a jerk than a smut peddler.

Jasper:
 Brian, they're your family. They'll love you even if you made a couple of crappy movies. I mean, Blythe Danner still loves Gwyneth Paltrow. Ooh, score one for me!

Melissa Rivers:
 Welcome back to E!'s Adult Video Awards preshow. It's a good crowd here tonight, Mom.

Joan Rivers:
 It sure is, Melissa. All the studs and sluts are arriving. Brian! Brian!

Brian:
 Uh, hey.

Joan Rivers:
 You're nominated for three of the seven films you directed yesterday: Add Momma to the Train, The Purple Head of Cairo and, uh-what was the third one?

Brian:
 You've Got Male Genitalia.

Joan Rivers:
 You know, I was asked to star in a porno once. Yeah, but I couldn't. 'Cause, you know, most of my body is less than 18 years old. [Laughing] I used to guest host The Tonight Show.

Brian:
 Oh, yeah. What was that, like, 30 years ago? Your mike isn't plugged in. You're not even on television right now, are you?

Joan Rivers:
 In my mind! [Groaning]

Ron Jeremy:
 The next award is for Best Original Score in an adult film. And the nominees are Ron Jones...[funky music playing]...Walter Murphy...[similar funky music]...and John Williams.[Orchestral music playing]

Lois:
 Well, you've come a long way from hiding from the vacuum cleaner.

Brian:
 Lois!

Peter:
 Hey, buddy. Hey, how are you, Alfred Hitch"cock"? You like that one, Dick Hertz? I'm sorry. I'm already drunk.

Brian:
 How did you guys know?

Lois:
 Jasper called. Brian, why didn't you tell us?

Brian:
 I thought you'd be ashamed of me.

Peter:
 You kiddin'? I ought to knock you out for not bringing me here sooner. Look at the pair on that one, Lois. Bigger than your head.

Brian:
 So, you guys aren't offended by this?

Lois:
 Well, I can't say I approve, but we love you. If this is what makes you happy, we support you.

Brian:
 My God! I thought I needed to get away from you guys to find what was missing in my life but the only thing I'm missing is my family. How could I ever have become involved in this filthy, degrading business?

Ron Jeremy:
 ...And the award goes to Brian Griffin!

Audience:
 [Cheers]

Brian:
 Wow! My God! This is unexpected. I want to thank my incredible production team, who've been with me from 'Shaving Private Ryan' all the way to 'Welcome to My Face.'

Lois:
 He lives with us back in Quahog.

Porn Producer:
 You got a nice wiggle, baby. You want to be in a movie, huh? A little girl-girl action, maybe?

Peter:
 Good luck, buddy. I've been barking up that tree for 17 years.

Lois:
 Well, that was a wonderful trip! And everyone has something to remember it by.

Peter:
 You're gonna love it at our house, Jenna Jameson.

Lois:
 That's funny. I don't remember buying Stewie these toys. Oh, my God! It all makes sense now. My baby is some kind of diabolical genius bent on world domination!

Stewie:
 [slow clapping] Bravo, Lois. The last horse finally crosses the finish line.

Lois:
 Stewie! All these months I should've been paying attention to what you've been saying. You're an evil child. Why? Why did I have to go and smoke pot when I was pregnant with you?

Stewie:
 Cheer up, Mother. You should be proud. You've given birth to the future emperor of the world. Pity you won't be around to enjoy it. Cheerio!

Lois:
 [Screams]

Peter:
 Lois. Lois! What's the matter?

Lois:
 I just had the strangest dream. Something about Stewie and Cheerios. It's gone.

Peter:
 Well, come on, get up. It's opening day for the Sox. Hey, Chris, Meg, we're going to Fenway!

Lois:
 Peter, you can't pull the kids out of school for a baseball game.

Peter:
 Aw, there's nothing these kids learn in school they can't learn on the street.

Gang Member:
 It's 3:00. Where the hell is Louie?

Gang Member:
 Depends if he stops to see his ho.

Chris:
 Look what I made for the game. [holds up sign reading John 3:16]

Meg:
 What does that mean, anyway?

Brian:
 <reading from Bible> "And the Lord said, 'Go, Sox."'

Meg:
 Dad, don't you have to work today?

Peter:
 It's nothing a little phone call can't take care of.

 Weed:
 Hello?

Peter:
 Mr. Weed? I can't come to work today. I was in a terrible plane crash. My entire family was killed, and I am a vegetable. I'll see you tomorrow. <hangs up> Huh? Huh?

Brian:
 Oh, please, Peter. Your excuses are lamer than FDR's legs.

All:
 [Gasping]

Brian:
 Too soon?

Mom:
 Here it comes, Jeremy!

Jeremy:
 I got it! I got it!

Peter:
 Yes! Yeah! All right! I'm the man! Yeah! Hold on to this, Stewie. It'll be a souvenir of your first major-league game with your dad.

Stewie:
 My God. I shall cherish this forever. I say, Opie, I'll trade you this baseball for your souvenir bat.

Boy:
 Sure!

Stewie:
 What did you learn?

Peter:
 This is great. We haven't done anything together like this since we saw Mike Tyson get beat.

Moderator:
 The word, again, is "onomatopoeia."

Mike Tyson:
 Uh..."C."

Moderator:
 I'm sorry. That's incorrect.

Mike Tyson:
 Oh, dang!

Lois:
 I'm so glad you talked us all into playing hooky.

Peter:
 Me, too. Hey, maybe we can get on TV if we take our shirts off and run onto the field.

Lois:
 Peter, I'm not taking my shirt off.

Peter:
 [pulls up Lois' shirt] There. Now they're old news.

Peter:
 Go, Sox! [tumbles down steps] [Screaming] Hmmm.[Snorting hot dog] [Snorting mustard]

 Weed:
 Peter?

Peter:
 Oh, uh, hi, Mr. Weed.

 Weed:
 Well, tt seems you've made a full recovery.

Peter:
 Oh, yeah. That plane crash I told you about, it turned out to be gas.

 Weed:
 Aha! Liar! Tomorrow, my office, 9:30.

Peter:
 I'm tired of Mr. Weed treating me like a common doormat. I want him to treat me like one of those deluxe one from Pottery Barn with the fancy straw.

Brian:
 I don't care for Pottery Barn. Peter, if you want Mr. Weed to respect you, you're gonna have to earn it.

Peter:
 Hmm, "earn it." [Snorting drink]

 Weed:
 Why have you forsaken me?

Peter:
 Uh, Mr. Weed? I heard you ran into my identical twin brother at the ball game yesterday. And if you don't buy that, I'm sorry I was at the ball game yesterday.

 Weed:
 Peter, I just received terrible news. This company has been taken over by a conglomerate. After 23 years of faithful service, I've been terminated!

Peter:
 Wow, the business world sure is funny.

Wally:
 Hey, Dilbert, what do you call it when a guy in middle management moves all the way to upper management?

Dilbert:
 I don't know. What do you call it?

Wally:
 A promotion.

Dilbert:
 Oh, thanks. Here's a memo.

Peter:
 Well ometimes the business world's funny.

Executive:
 And so, on behalf of the El Dorado Cigarette Company I'd like to welcome you to our family. I think you'll be very happy with the changes we've made.

Peter:
 Aw, this is sweet! Why are you putting a window in the middle of the factory?

Construction worker:
 So Aunt Bee has a place to let her pies cool.

Aunt Bee:
 Hello, boys. Today's pie is cherry. It'll be ready just in time for lunch.

Peter:
 Wow, these guys sure know how to run a company.

Executive:
 Look how happy those morons are. They'll never realize we're using those toys to get children addicted to our company's cigarettes.

All:
 [Laughing maniacally]

Executive:
 [Whistles] Good boy, Connor. Pull.

Chris:
 Can't we eat? I'm so hungry I could ride a horse. I don't get it. Well, I could ride it to the store, I guess.

Lois:
 I told you we're not starting without your father. Dinner just isn't dinner without him.

Stewie:
 Well, perhaps I could help simulate the experience. [throws face into food] [makes ridiculous noises]

Peter:
 Hey, family. Anyone in the mood for lobste-oh, God! One of them has my pupil! [Screaming]

Brian:
 Peter, how the hell can you afford lobster on your salary?

Peter:
 I got a raise.

Peter:
 Yeah. The new owners gave everyone raises. Even Kenneth, the bad-ass mail clerk with the heart of gold.

Peter:
 Hi, Kenneth. Hey, did I get any mail?

Kenneth:
 No! But if you come any closer, I'll slice you!

Peter:
 Okay! Okay! Man, what a bad-ass!

Man:
 Yeah? That bad-ass just gave half his paycheck to orphans. Orphans with diseases!

Peter:
 And check out the new toys we're making.

Meg:
 "Baby Smokes-A-Lot"?

Lot:
 [smokes][Baby giggling] Tastes like happy.

Chris:
 Cool! That's imitatable!

Brian:
 What the hell? El Dorado Cigarettes? That's who bought your company?

Lois:
 Oh, my God! They're trying to corrupt our children!

Brian:
 Well, what do you expect? Those bastards turned a whole generation of Americans into smokers with their damned subliminal advertising.

Ma:
 Timmy, where's Lassie?

Timmy:
 She's out in the orchard, Ma. Peaches are coming in mighty early this year.

Jerry:
 Smoke!

Ma:
 You know what they say, Timmy. "Early peaches, long summer."

Lassie:
 [Barking]

Timmy:
 What's that, Lassie?

Jerry:
 Are you smoking yet?

Lois:
 Peter, if kids see this doll, they're gonna think smoking's okay. You have to talk to your new bosses first thing in the morning.

Peter:
 Don't you worry, Lois. I'll set them straight. Just like I did with Chris.

Chris:
 Dad, what's the blowhole for?

Peter:
 Gentlemen, we need to talk. My wife says you're trying to get kids to smoke.

Executive:
 That's just not true.

Peter:
 What about this toy?

Executive:
 Peter, it's just a doll with a cigarette. I mean Barbie has a Dream Car, but you don't see every 8-year-old driving. They're just fun toys.

Executive:
 Not now, Jerry. Trust me, Peter. The last thing we want is to get kids to start smoking.

Peter:
 What about that graph on the wall that says: "The first thing we want is to get kids to start smoking"?

Executive:
 That? Oh, that's just something my son made me in art class.

Peter:
 Then what about that poster that says: "The graph was not made in art class. We really do want kids to start smoking"?

Executive:
 Look, we're a caring company. I mean, would you really be the president of a company that didn't care about kids?

Peter:
 No. But I'm not the president.

Executive:
 Yes, you are, if you want to be.

Men:
 [Agreeing]

Peter:
 Oh, wow. Imagine, me, president.

Peter:
 I'll do it!

Peter:
 [sings "Hail to the Chief" off-key]

Lois:
 So how did it go?

Peter:
 I'm not finished yet. [more "Hail to the Chief"] Aren't you gonna ask me how it went?

Lois:
 Yes! Did you talk to the company executives?

Peter:
 [more "Hail to the Chief"]

Lois:
 Peter, answer me!

Peter:
 Yeah, I did! They made me president.

Meg:
 Of the whole company?

Peter:
 You should've seen the way they were treating me. I never got that kind of respect before.

Peter:
 Great workout, Bobby.

Boy:
 Up yours, sack breath!

Peter:
 That's "Mister Griffin."

Lois:
 But, Peter, why would they make you president?

Peter:
 Maybe it's because I can recite all 50 states in a quarter of a second. [Yelps]

Peter:
 Jeez, Lois, I thought you'd be proud of me. After all these years, the company thinks I'm worth something. Wait till you see all the perks we're gonna get.

Meg:
 Um, hi. Can I help you?

Ugly Girl:
 Some company hired me to stand next to you so you'd look better by comparison.

Meg:
 That's ridiculous. I don't need...

Boy:
 Meg, did you get less ugly?

Meg:
 Yeah!

Lois:
 Everything looks the same.

Peter:
 Oh, it looks the same, but actually El Dorado Cigarettes has coated the entire inside of the house with a microfilm of Teflon, so it's easy to clean.

Lois:
 Oh!

Peter:
 Maybe I shouldn't have had them do the floors.

Stewie:
 I'm "Nudes on Ice"!

Lois:
 This is so exciting. Your father's first day as president.

Peter:
 Good morning, First Family. Ooh, Lois, what's in this coffee?

Lois:
 Isn't it wonderful? The company sent Martha Stewart to help me with the housework. I take back all the bad things I said about them. The coffee is delicious, Martha.

Martha Stewart:
 A little chicory perks up the taste of roasted coffee beans. It's a good thing.

Brian:
 Well, I think it's a crappy thing! In fact, this is my last cigarette, ever. You make me sick, letting yourselves be bought off with a few lousy perks.

Stewie:
 Oh, I beg to differ.

Valet:
 Oh, you don't need to park here, Mr. Griffin. You have an executive parking space now.

Peter:
 But that looks exactly like my old space.

Valet:
 Yeah, but this one comes with your own company suck-up.

up:
 Morning, Mr. Griffin. Nice day.

Peter:
 It's a little cloudy.

up:
 It's absolutely cloudy, one of the worst days I've seen in years. So, good news about the Yankees.

Peter:
 I hate the Yankees.

up:
 Pack of cheatters, that's what they are. I love your tie.

Peter:
 I hate this tie.

up:
 It's awful, it's gaudy, it's gotta go.

Peter:
 And I hate myself.

up:
 I hate you, too. You make me sick, you fat sack of crap.

Peter:
 But I'm the president.

up:
 The best there is.

Peter:
 But you just said you hated me.

up:
 But not you, the president, the you who said you hated you who...love, hate, Yankees, clouds...[head explodes]

Valet:
 I'll have that fixed for you tomorrow, sir.

Executive:
 Here's your new digs. Now, get to work, sport. We're counting on you.

Peter:
 Wow. My own office. Well, I guess I'd better get busy. [Pencil sharpening][sighs][sticks finger in pencil sharpener] Ah! [looks furtively around and unzips pants][prolonged screams]

Executive:
 Gentlemen, we have a problem. There's an anti-smoking bill before Congress that could put us out of business.

Executive:
 I don't understand it. We've tried everything to get through to these politicians. Harvard lawyers, lobbyists, wisecracking leprechauns.

Leprechaun:
 Excuse me. Do you have a dollar? I'm a little short. [Laughs]

Executives:
 Yeah. Yeah. Good thought.

Executive:
 But where are we going to find someone within the company who's that stupid?

Executives:
 Yeah, yeah. That's exactly what we need.

Executive:
 You bet we did. Gentlemen, our new tobacco lobbyist is That Guy!

Singers:
 ? Diamonds, daisies, snowflakes, That Guy ? ? Chestnuts, rainbows, springtime is That Guy ? ? He's tinsel on a tree ? ? He's everything that every guy should be ? ? Sable, popcorn, white wine, That Guy ? ? Gingham, bluebirds, Broadway is That Guy ? ? He's mine alone, but luckily for you ? ? if you find a guy to love ? ? only one guy to love then he'll be That Guy, too ? That Guy!

Peter:
 So, uh, what's this big assignment you got for me, Chairman of the Broad?

Executive:
 [Laughs] "Chairman of the Broad." When did you become such a stitch?

Peter:
 Don't you remember? You gave me writers. "Sir, I don't want to say you're rich, but when you walk into a bank, all the tellers go, 'Whoopee!"' That wasn't funny. I thought you guys said you were Jewish.

Writer:
 He's only half-Jewish.

Peter:
 You're fired.

Executive:
 Here's the thing, Griffin. Some troublemakers in Congress are trying to shut us down. We need someone important, like you, to go down to Washington and help those bastards see what kind of fun-Ioving people the tobacco industry's really made of.

Peter:
 Washington? Ah, sweet. I'm your man. But I gotta warn you-I made enemies on the Hill.

Peter:
 And that's when Clarence Thomas forced me into his chambers and showed me lewd pictures.

Senator:
 Mr. Griffin, we have indisputable evidence that not only have you never been in the same room as Clarence Thomas, you've never been in the same state. How do you respond to that?

Peter:
 Baba Booey! Baba Booey! Howard Stern's penis! Baba Booey! Baba Booey! Baba Booey!

Meg:
 How long will Dad be in Washington?

Lois:
 As long as it takes. He's a very important man now. You know, he's the spokesman for his entire industry.

Lois:
 Thank you, Martha. Brian, could you pass me the TV Guide?

Brian:
 Piss off!

Brian:
 I'm sorry. It just feels like forever since I've had a smoke. I'm just a bit testy. Stop staring at my tail!

Peter:
 Hello, Mr. Harrison? Yeah, I see those government guys you were telling me about. I'll show them a good time and bring them around to our side. Excuse me. Al Gore, George W. Bush?

Al Gore:
 Yes?

 Bush:
 Yes?

Peter:
 Ah, great. And what's your friend's name?

Al Gore:
 Dick Armey.

Peter:
 [Laughs] No, seriously. What's his name?

Peter:
 [Laughs]

Al Gore:
 [Laughs] Oh, I just got it.

Peter:
 Hey, Armey. What's your wife's name? "Vagina Coast Guard"? Nah, I'm kidding, you guys. Hey, get in the car. We're going to a skin bar.

All:
 Great. Yeah. Sounds good.

Senator:
 Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I don't know what happened!

Peter:
 Whoa, it's okay, it's okay, Senator. This girl didn't have a family. It'll be like she never existed. Now grab a hold of yourself. All right. Now, listen. You may have killed her when you shoved those dollar bills down her throat. You may have killed her when you hit her with the stool. I don't know. I'm not a doctor. But I'll tell you what didn't kill her. Smoking!

Al Gore:
 You have our support, Griffin.

Lois:
 Look, kids. Here's your father in People magazine with Jim Carrey. And they're both "Smokin'!" I loved that in Mask. "Smokin'!" "Smokin'!" "Smokin'!"

Brian:
 Damn it! Do I have to listen to this drivel 24 hours a day? But I guess anything's better than looking at your smelly face!

Meg:
 Mom!

Lois:
 Honey, your face smells fine. You know he doesn't mean it. It's just the lack of nicotine.

Chris:
 Hey, Mom, the school janitor said that Dad's working for the bad guys. And he said it through a hole in his throat.

Lois:
 Well, That doesn't make him right.

Chris:
 If I had a hole in my throat, I'd put pennies in it!

Lois:
 Listen, your father's doing great work, and life's never been better.

Stewie:
 Yes, I, too, applaud the oaf for finally showing some initiative. God knows he was years overdue.

Lois:
 [Gasps]

Stewie:
 You know who I saw at the market today? Patty Croft. Oh, and she has gotten fat!

Lois:
 Oh, my God! Stewie, no! Oh, God. What have I done? I knew smoking was bad, but I still sold my soul. And for what? Martha Stewart? Come on, kids. We gotta put a stop to this. Now!

Martha Stewart:
 [Sighs] Finally. [Farting]

Bill:
 ? They call me Bill, yes, they call me Bill ? ? And I'm standing here on Capitol... ? [screams]

Lois:
 There you are! Peter, I caught Stewie smoking. That cigarette company is evil. We can't be a part of this anymore.

Peter:
 Lois, this is the best job I ever had! Hey, since I became president, profits have been higher than Alyssa Milano. [Laughs]

Alyssa Milano:
 What kind of cheap shot...Joel!

Joel:
 I'm suing. I'm suing. I'm on it.

Aide:
 Mr. Griffin, time for your speech.

Lois:
 But, Peter, what about your son?

Peter:
 So Stewie had a puff. He's old enough to make his own decisions. For God's sakes, Lois, he's 1. Cut the umbilical cord!

Peter:
 Ladies and gentlemen of Congress, I am here today to talk about smoking.

Lois:
 Please, Peter, do the right thing.

Peter:
 I know a lot of you are already on my side. And for you naysayers, I have two strong words for you: come on! Come on!

Congressmen:
 Okay, sure. All right. Done.

Peter:
 Thank you, ladies and...

Stewie:
 [Stewie coughing] Baby needs to suck ash! Baby needs to suck ash! Not "ass," you pervert. Save it for the interns.

Peter:
 Is that a baby? Oh, my God! That's Stewie! Lois was right! Children under 4 shouldn't smoke! Look, I don't care about this stupid job anymore. Cigarettes are bad!

Congressman:
 Mr. Griffin is right! Smoking is a horrible vice! It shortens life expectancy and pollutes our air. And according to recent polls, air is good.

Congressman Frank:
 Gentlemen, I propose we send a message to tobacco companies everywhere by fining the El Dorado Cigarette Company infinity billion dollars!

Congressmen:
 Aye! Aye!

Executive:
 But that'll bankrupt us!

Peter:
 Oh, you mean the way you've morally bankrupted America?

Congressmen:
 [Laughing]

Peter:
 Thanks for that zinger, boys. Now, give me a snappy line to go out on.

Writer:
 Actually, our lunch is here.

Peter:
 [Stuttering] Well, that's my mama! [Laughing nervously]

Horace:
 Here you go, boys. (Passes the group some beers.)

Peter:
 Thanks, Horace. So I told my boss I'm not staying in that stupid toy factory. I'm gonna go places. (Jabs his finger onto the table.)

Cleveland:
 Oh, that's cool. (Quagmire bobs his head)

Cleveland:
 Oh, that's fly. (Quagmire bobs his head)

Horace:
 Here you go, boys.

Cleveland:
 Oh, you are living la vida loca. (Quagmire bobs his head.)

Joe:
 Well, it's late. I better head home.

Horace:
 What do you mean "home"? You guys live here.

Quagmire:
 Yeah. Here's to the Drunken Clam, boys. Where they don't ask for proof of age,and neither do I. (All sip their beer)

Cleveland:
 Quagmire, you forgot to say "oh."

Quagmire:
 (looking around) Are you sure? I think--think I did. All right. Well, just to be safe, oh! (Does his signature thrust. Sudden cut to the bar's TV.)

Diane Simmons:
 We interrupt this program to bring you a special bulletin on the approach of hurricane Norman.

Tom Tucker:
 Here with an update is Greg, the weather mime.

Tom Tucker:
 Okay, i-it's gonna be cold, very cold, and--and there's gonna be wind, and- (Shows Greg wiggling his fingers and bringing his hands down. (Implying rain.) Cut back to Tom.)-people's parents will throw fecal matter down on them from the rooftops! How awful! (Shows Greg glaring at Tom with clenched fists.) Oh, no. I'm sorry, that's--that's rain. Yes. It'll rain.

Lois:
 Remember,the number-one cause of injury during a hurricane is broken glass. So stay away from the windows. (Glares at Peter.) And Peter, put those away.

Peter:
 Aw, come on, Lois. Just one more song. (Begins playing music with glasses)

Chris:
 Mom, I'm afraid if I fall asleep, the hurricane's gonna sneak up on me and give me a vasectomy.

Peter:
 Relax, Chris. Nothing bad ever happens when you're asleep. In fact, sometimes good things can happen.

Peter:
 Oh, Jeni. Jeni. (Lois opens her eyes.) Oh, yeah, Jeni, don't stop. (Lois sits up in bed and glares at Peter.) Oh, Richard Jeni, your HBO comedy specials have brought pleasure to millions. (Lois smiles, lies down and closes her eyes.) And what a sweet ass. (Lois snaps her eyes open.)

Priest:
 Right this way, everyone.

Woman:
 Bless you for helping us, Father.

Priest:
 It's God's wish, my dear. (Woman walks inside. The Priest takes off his mask to reveal that he's actually Quagmire.) (snickers) All right!

Diane Simmons:
 Well, hurricane Norman is beginning to pound Quahog. We now go live to Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa for a look at how locals are dealing with the imminent disaster. Tricia? (Cut to a scene of Tricia Takanawa standing outside. Fierce winds are blowing.)

Tricia Takanawa:
 Diane, I am here in- (Gets hit by a car that is being blown by the wind. Cut back to the news.)

Diane Simmons:
 Thank you, Tricia. Stay tuned for further- (Gets hit by Greg the Weather Mime, who is being blown by the wind.)

Griffin Family:
 Ahh! Oh, what a mess!

Meg:
 Look at that! (Points to a tree with a plank through it.)

Brian:
 Wow!

Peter:
 For the love of God, do something!

Family:
 Oh, my God! Daddy! Daddy!

Peter:
 Oh, God! Oh, God! Gotcha! (Pulls the plank off to reveal it's one of those arrow-through-the-head dealies. Family laughs.) See, kids, natural disasters have their lighter sides, too. You just have to be creative.

Chris:
 Yeah, like my dead-rat marionette theater. (is shown holding two dead rats attached to strings, like puppets. Chris begins to make a "conversation" between the two rats.)

Stewie:
 Right, that's brilliant!

Cleveland:
 Oh, my, look at all the damage.

Peter:
 Oh, thank God the open air debris garden is still intact. (Shows the open air debris garden. Which is actually a bunch of trash.)

Cleveland:
 Peter, look! (Points) The Clam! (Tires screeching as Peter brakes, Cleveland gets slammed into the windshield. They rush out of the car to see the wreckage of the Clam.)

Peter:
 Ahh! This is horrible! (Quagmire gets all teary around this point.)

Horace:
 (is carrying a suitcase) You think this is horrible, try losing a testicle in a knife fight with your mother!

Joe:
 What about your bar?!

Horace:
 It's not my bar anymore. I sold the place. Let someone else worry about hurricanes.

Peter:
 Who'd buy a wrecked bar?

Horace:
 The bar's not wrecked. (A bulldozer clears away the wreckage to reveal a new bar called "The Clam's Head Pub.")

Together:
 All right!

Peter:
 Oh, thank you, God.

God:
 Don't mention it. (rides off on a white horse. Quagmire, Peter, Joe, and Cleveland rush into the new Clam.)

Peter:
 Wait a minute. Something's different. (orchestral music playing. Pans around the room to show British men dressed in suits, and bowlers, and all that jazz.)

British bartender:
 Evening, gents. How about a nice, warm lager?

British Man:
 And help yourself to a packet of crisps.

Peter:
 Holy crap! It's a gay bar! (Cleveland stares at Peter)

Joe:
 They turned the Drunken Clam into a British pub!

Peter:
 Oh, well, at least they still got sports on TV. (Walks over to the TV.)

Announcer:
 The new bowler for Somerset is our Spinner Heath who has a cover point long on square leg deep extra cover on two short legs.

British Guy:
 Oh, it's cricket. Marvelous game, really. You see, the bowler hurls the ball towards the batter, who tries to play away a fine leg. He endeavors to score by dashing between the creases, provided the wicket keeper hasn't whipped his bails off, of course.

Peter:
Anybody get that?

Peter:
 Well, someone tell this cigarette to shut up. (Quagmire rushes in from the bathroom, holding a book.)

Quagmire:
 Hey, guys! Th-there's no more girlie magazines in the can! All they got is this--this David Copperfield! (Displays the book.)

Peter:
 W-w-wait, any pictures of his girlfriend? (Quagmire flips frantically through the pages.)

Quagmire:
 No! No pictures at all!

Cleveland:
 I think we should go.

British Guy:
 I say, Caruthers.

Caruthers:
 Hmm.

British Guy:
 Do you know what's very, very, funny? (pause) A man dressed in women's clothing.

Caruthers:
 Hmm, yes, quite. Ripping good laugh.

British Guy:
 Yes.

[Scene:
 The inside of the Griffin house. Peter bursts through the door.]

Peter:
 Lois, the Drunken Clam's been taken over by a bunch of lousy, limey, tea-sucking British bastards!

Nigel:
 Hello, Nigel Pinchley here. I was just introducing myself to your wife, who I must say is an absolutely gorgeous bit of crumpet. (Nigel and Lois start laughing. Nigel looks over Lois. )

Peter:
 Holy crap! You're one of them!

Lois:
 Peter! Nigel and his daughter are our new neighbors.

Nigel:
 Yes, and I'm afraid I'm the "limey bastard" who has purchased your bar. Bit of an awkward moment, really.

Peter:
 Awkward moment? I'll give you an awkward moment. One time during sex, I called Lois "Frank." Your move, Sherlock. (Nigel stares at Lois, and Lois looks shocked. And embarressed.)

Lois:
 Peter! (To Nigel) Excuse us. (Ushers Peter out of the room.) Why are you acting like this? Nigel's charming. All British men are.

Peter:
 Yeah, right. That's what they said about Benjamin Disraeli. (Cut to a scene of Benjamin Disraeli sitting at a desk)

Benjamin Disraeli:
 You don't even know who I am. (Cut back to Lois and Peter)

Lois:
 The British are a lovely people. Not physically, of course, but inside. And Nigel has a very sweet little daughter.

Scene:
 Outside the Griffin House. Stewie is sitting at a small table. A girl approaches.)

Eliza:
 (cockney accent) Aw, look at the little baby!

Stewie:
 Ahh! What the devil is that ghastly noise?

Eliza:
 It's me! Eliza Pinchley. You want a flower, little baby? (offers a flower to Stewie)

Stewie:
 Excuse me. What I think you mean to say is,"Would I like a flower?" Heavens! You don't so much speak the language as chew on it and spit it out!

Eliza:
 Go on. What's wrong with the way I talk?

Stewie:
 [shuddering] Everything. Look, here's a shiny sixpence if you keep your mouth shut and go away. (Tosses the coin on the ground. Eliza turns and bends down to pick it up. Stewie glances at her butt.) Eh!

Lois:
 Honey, I know the Drunken Clam was your bar. But maybe you and your friends can find somewhere else to act like idiots.

Peter:
 Yeah, I guess you're right. You know why I married you, Lois? It's not just the rack, or the caboose. It's that big, sexy brain of yours. (Begins licking Lois's head. Both are laughing.)

Peter:
 All right, this place isn't bad.

Joe:
 Oh yeah. Good music, real sports on the tube.

Quagmire:
 I've never seen so many chicks in one place. Hey, hey. Check out those two hotties.(snickering) They're so lonely, they're practicing kissing each other.

Cleveland:
 I don't think they're practicing.

All:
 (Dissapointed) Oh. (Happier) Oh! (Uh, delighted?) Ah! (Realization setting in.)Oh. (All turn to leave, except Quagmire. He walks over to the two hotties mentioned earlier. And he bobs his head a bit.)

Quagmire:
 So, you ladies ever been penetrated? (He gets forcefully thrown out of the club. Ow.)

Quagmire:
 Yup.

Peter:
 Yup.

Joe:
 Yup.

Woman:
 Hope the loo is working.

Quagmire:
 Ah, this sucks. Nice choice for a hangout, Peter. There's not even anywhere to sit down!

Joe:
 Is that some kinda crack?

Peter:
 What do you mean crack, are you saying I got a fat ass?

Cleveland:
 Fellas, fellas, what's become of us? We never squabbled before we lost the Clam.

Quagmire:
 Yeah, you're right! It's those lousy fog breathers!

Peter:
 Damn British! First they took our bar, now they're taking our friendship! What's next, apple pie, fast cars, and action films?

Schwarzenegger:
 (voiceover) It was a glorious summer in Oxford when I met Freddy Cavendish, a most remarkable young man, whose friendship would change my life forever.

Sylvester Stallone:
 (Leans back in the boat) You are the anchor that gives my spirit license to soar.

Joe:
 Our forefathers wouldn't have taken it on the chin like this.

Peter:
 You're damn right. I say we fight the British and drive them back to whatever country they came from!

Cleveland:
 We gonna get 'em.

Lois:
 Stewie, look. It's an invitation to little Eliza's birthday party!

Stewie:
 You mean that horrid girl who talks like a scullery maid? I didn't realize she'd been born. I assumed she'd simply congealed in a gutter somewhere. (Lois chuckles.)

Lois:
 Ooh, i'm gonna r.s.v.p. right now! (Walks off)

Stewie:
 Oh, splendid. An entire afternoon of her "ers," and "ars," and "'alf a pound of ha'penny rice." God, why can't the English teach their children how to speak?

Brian:
 (Looks up from reading.) Why don't you teach her? Unless you don't think you're up to it.

Stewie:
 (Mockingly) Oh, yes, this is the part where I'm supposed to say, "Oh, I am so up to it". (Begins laughing, then abruptly stops and points accusingly at Brian.) Well, I am! I accept your challenge! At the celebration of her birthday, I shall pass that guttersnipe off as a lady! What are the stakes of this wager?

Brian:
 Why don't you shut up for about a week?

Stewie:
 Very well. And if I win?

Brian:
 Well, I--I wasn't betting. (Gets up from chair.)Why don't you just shut up for about a week? (Walks off)

Stewie:
 You're on!

Peter:
 Minutemen, present arms! (They each hold up a beer) Load weapons! (They all begin shaking their beers and chanting)

All:
 Boom-shaka-laka-laka! Boom-shaka-laka-laka! Boom-shaka-laka-laka!

Peter:
 Fire! (They open their beers and let it splash all over the English customers.)

Various British:
 Oh, I say! Throw the blackguards out!

Nigel:
 Gentlemen, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave!

Cleveland:
 Don't tread on me!

Peter:
 Yeah, back off! We kicked your ass in World War II, and we can do it again!

Nigel:
 Very well, then. If you refuse to go peaceably, I'm afraid we'll have to useour superior linguistic skills to convince you to leave.

Peter:
 Oh, yeah? Just try it!

All:
 Bye, now.

Cleveland:
Thanks.

Joe:
 Sorry to bother you.

Quagmire:
 I never saw it that way before. Wait, how the hell did they do that?

Peter:
Well, we're not gonna let this stop us. I've never been defeated, except once.

Peter:
 Eric?

Eric:
 Peter!

Peter:
 Oh, my God, I haven't seen you since high school. God! What are you doing these days?

Eric:
 I'm the red guy.

Peter:
 Oh my God.

Eric:
 What are you doing?

Peter:
 I'm the green guy.

Eric:
 No kidding?

Eric:
 Hey, is that Stacy Beecham?

Peter:
 Where?

Peter:
 Now, don't worry. These guys are trained to stay perfectly still. Check it out. Hey, Margaret Thatcher...what the hell? I thought you English guys never moved.

Sentry:
 No. That's just our women. [both laughing] Bloody hell! My lunch was in that hat! Egg and chips with jam booties!

Joe:
 Welcome to the Quahog Beer Party!

Cleveland:
 I do feel a little guilty about pollutin'.

Quagmire:
 I felt guilty once, but she woke up halfway through.

Cleveland:
 Peter, what are you doing?

Peter:
 Hey, it may taste like a warm cup of tobacco chewers' spit but it's still beer, damn it.

Quagmire:
 Good point. Bottoms up!

Peter:
 Take that, you lousy Brits!

Lois:
 Peter, we waited up all night. Where were you?

Peter:
 Where was I? Where were you?

Lois:
 Out drinking. But I was back by 2:00.

Tom Tucker:
 Our top story: the Clam's Head Pub has burned to the ground. Our own Tricia Takanawa is on the scene.

Tricia Takanawa:
 Is Quahog in the grip of a serial arsonist? Police say no, but our producer says yes. Here's an artist's depiction of what the arsonist might look like. [sketch of a giant, fire-breathing insect] Anyone with information about this suspect should contact Quahog police immediately. One thing is certain-the pain here is palpable. For many, this charred portrait of Elizabeth II gives poignant new meaning to the phrase, "Hey, check out that flaming queen."

Tom Tucker:
 In a late-breaking development, the police have a new suspect. We now go live to Hispanic reporter, Maria... [Stuttering]

Diane Simmons:
 Jimenez.

Tom Tucker:
 I know what it is.

Maria Jimenez:
 Well, Tom, at this moment we're approaching the suspect's house.

Peter:
 Ah, this is better than Cops. You know there's a fat drunk guy in there.

Peter:
 There he is.

Peter:
 Hang on, hang on, I want to see what they do with this jackass.

Lois:
 Oh, my God! Peter, you didn't!

Peter:
 Hey, fatty's wife is a babe!

Maria Jimenez:
 Well, Tom, it appears the real arsonist is in custody thanks to an anonymous tip to the authorities.

Giant Bug:
 Good. Good.

Peter:
 The fat guy's struggling. Hit him, you stupid pigs, hit him! Use the billy...

Judge:
 This Quahog Minutemen flag was found at the wreckage of the Clam's Head. You are clearly guilty of arson, so you are free to go... straight to jail! Now you got burned! No bail!

Lois:
 Peter, tell me you didn't do this.

Peter:
 Lois, I didn't do it! You know you can trust me, right? Come on, let's sit down and talk about this.

Lois:
 I want to believe you, but...

Peter:
 Gotcha! But seriously, you can trust me.

Nigel:
 Oh, Lois, I'm so sorry this terrible tragedy has befallen you.

Lois:
 Thank you, Nigel. You're very kind.

Nigel:
 Can I touch your bum once?

Nigel:
 Now I expect to see you at Eliza's birthday, and I won't take no for an answer unless the question is, "Do you not like me?" Get it? Double negative, you know? Very good. Yes.

Peter:
 Thank you!

Peter:
 Gosh, everybody's so nice here. I mean, they're gonna be disappointed when they find out I'm not gay, but wow!

Joe:
 Oh, my God. See that guy? That's the most vicious killer I ever put away. His name's Steve Bellows. He's so mean, he once shot a man for snoring.

Quagmire:
 Where have I heard that before?

Joe:
 It's all in this simulated leather-bound edition of Time-Life's "Killers of Quahog."

Peter:
 Wow. They're all here. John the Biter, the Berserk Hobo, the Golden Autumn Day Strangler.

Cleveland:
 Maybe Steve won't remember you.

Steve Bellows:
 Well, well, Officer Swanson. You and your friends are dead! You're all dead!

Peter:
 Oh, good. He thinks we're zombies. He'll leave us alone.

Stewie:
 No, no, no! If you're ever going to be a lady, you must learn to speak like one. Now try it again. "The life of the wife is ended by the knife."

Eliza:
 "The loif of the w..."

Stewie:
 No, no, no. Not "loif," "life!" "Life!"

Eliza:
 That's wha' I said! "Loif!"

Stewie:
 Now listen to me, you tin-eared piece of baggage, we've got five days left, and I'll not lose my wager. Now repeat after me. "Hello, Mother. Have you hidden my hatchet?"

Eliza:
 'Allo, Mother. 'Ave you 'idden my 'atchet?"

Stewie:
 God, no! It's an "H" sound, you moron! H! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

Eliza:
 Ooh, your breath smells like kitty litter!

Stewie:
 I was curious!

Bonnie:
 Our husbands couldn't have done this.

Loretta:
 Yeah. Cleveland can't even light the damn hibachi on the Fourth of July!

Insurance Agent:
 Excuse me. Do you know where I can find Nigel Pinchley? I'm from Quahog Insurance, and I have a check for him.

Loretta:
 $5 million?

Insurance Agent:
 Yeah, lucky fella took out a huge policy the day before the fire.

Lois:
 Doesn't that strike you as a little suspicious?

Insurance Agent:
 No, not really. In fact, it seems to happen all the time.

Quagmire:
 Oh, no! Here comes Steve!

Steve Bellows:
 I haven't forgot about you boys! Saturday night at midnight, you're dead! All of you are dead!

Peter:
 Midnight on Saturday? Thank God! We can still be in the talent show! From the top, boys. Five, six, seven, eight!

Stewie:
 Once again, here is how it should sound. "How do you do?" And here is how you sound: [Can moos] Now try it again.

Eliza:
 "How do you do?"

Stewie:
 What did you say?

Eliza:
 "The life of the wife is ended by the knife."

Stewie:
 I think she's got it! I think she's got it!

Eliza:
 ? "The life of the wife is ended by the knife" ?

Stewie:
 By George, she's got it! By George, she's got it! Now, what ends her wretched life?

Eliza:
 ? The knife! The knife! ?

Stewie:
 And where's that bloody knife?

Eliza:
 ? In the wife! In the wife! ?

Both:
 ? The life of the wife is ended by the knife ?

Stewie:
 Bravo, Eliza!

Nigel:
 Hello. So nice to see you.

Lois:
 There he is. All right, we need to search the house for evidence. But one of us is gonna have to distract Nigel. Oh, no, no, no, I couldn't. Well, what about Loretta? Nigel looks like he's down with the swirl.

Nigel:
 Oh, there you are, Lois. Shall I give you the grand tour and show you my private quarters?

Lois:
 - I'd love to.

Nigel:
 I must say, you look absolutely...[Muttering] Oh, don't be shy, my lambie-lamb. This is my study where I... study things that arouse my interest.

Lois:
 [Thinking] Good, the girls are in place. [aloud] Oh, Nigel, since Peter's been gone, I've been searching for someone new. You know, someone with a sense of danger and adventure.

Nigel:
 I once played a game of cricket without shin guards.

Lois:
 Oh, I love a reckless man!

Nigel:
 One time, I went up to this bloke's flat, rang the bell, and ran like Sebastian Coe!

Lois:
 More! Tell me more!

Nigel:
 I burned down my pub for the insurance money and framed your husband!

Lois:
 I knew it! And what's more, I have witnesses! Bonnie! Loretta? Demond Wilson from Sanford and Son? What are you doing here?

Demond Wilson:
 I know. I'm surprised I'm alive, too.

Nigel:
 Sorry, love. Better luck next time.

Insurance Agent:
 Mr. Pinchley, I heard everything! What you've done is a textbook example of insurance "fraud"!

Nigel:
 Oh, bloody hell! What the devil were you doing in the closet anyway?

Insurance Agent:
 I came with Demond.

Butler:
 Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Eliza Pinchley.

Stewie:
 Psst! You-Dogbert! Down here! Get a front-row seat for this one.

Eliza:
 How kind of you all to come.

Stewie:
 Magnificent! I say, old sport, why don't you pull your face from your own loins and bury it into some humble pie?

Eliza:
 Oh, bloody 'ell! I've gone and wet meself!

Stewie:
 Don't give me that smug look! Fine! Well, you have extra-sensitive hearing. Hear this.

Brian:
 I'm telling.

Stewie:
 No! I said "vacuum"!

Quagmire:
 Hurry, Peter! Steve's gonna be here in five minutes!

Peter:
 Aw, crap! We're dead!

Quagmire:
 I guess this is the end, boys.

Joe:
 Looks like our next stop is a corner booth in a bar in Heaven!

Lois:
 Peter, Nigel confessed! You're free!

Peter:
 You hear that, guys? We're free!

All:
 All right! Yeah! Freedom!

Steve Bellows:
 Get ready to die! Oh. Huh. Wonder what this feels like. [stabs self] [Shouts] That hurts! My God, is that what I've been doing to people? I belong here.

Peter:
 Ah, Horace, I never thought I'd see you and the Clam again.

Horace:
 Ah, Florida stunk. An alligator mounted me when I wasn't looking and laid eggs in my lower intestine. But you're all thirsty. I'll bore you another time.

Peter:
 Here's to our wives. They may not be as hot as the women you see on TV, or as entertaining...but, um.... You know, I don't know where I'm going with this, but thanks anyway.

Lois:
 I guess that lousy Nigel learned his lesson. Whatever he gets is too good for him.

Eliza:
 Dear Stewie, I want you to know I blame my father's death and my incarceration in this hell hole entirely on your awful mother. If it takes the rest of my life, I shall see that she suffers a slow and painful death. Eliza.

Stewie:
 [Laughing] Excellent. Here, have a look.

Giant Bug:
 Good, good.

Diane Simmons:
 A tragic accident today in the north Providence area. A family of four lost their lives when their minivan swerved off the road and into a ravine, exploding on impact.

Tom Tucker:
 [Snickering]

Diane Simmons:
 Do you find this funny, Tom?

Tom Tucker:
 No, no, no. I was remembering, I accidentally put my shirt on inside out this morning. It's fine now, though. So, so, what were you saying? A fashion show?

Meg:
 Chris, turn the TV off. We gotta find an anniversary gift for Mom and Dad.

Chris:
 Don't look! We're shopping! We're shopping!

Lois:
 Oh, kids, you don't need to do anything special for our anniversary. Just your father.

Meg:
 I hope he doesn't wait and get your gift at the last minute again.

Lois:
 My goodness! A human thumb. Where did you ever find this?

Peter:
 It was on eBay. [vomiting] Oh, God! Call an ambulance!

Lois:
 This year, instead of exchanging gifts, I told him it would be nice if we could just spend a romantic day together.

Stewie:
 Oh, dear! I think we all know what that means. [Imitating springs] Gross.

Cleveland:
 Hey, fellas! Guess what? I got us a tee time tomorrow at Barrington Country Club.

Cleveland:
 Barrington? Wow!

Peter:
 I'm in.

Brian:
 Uh, Peter, tomorrow's your anniversary.

Peter:
 Aw, crap! If Lois finds out I'm ditching her to play golf, she'll hit me with a frying pan...which is why I'm gonna drink this frying-pan antidote. All right, hit me with this. Didn't work.

Lois:
 What the hell? <reading aloud> "Lois, it's an anniversary scavenger hunt. "Your first clue is at the Quahog Mini-Mart. Love, Peter." Oh, how fun!

Man:
 All right, gentlemen, before you tee off, here are your complimentary monogrammed bag towels, a sleeve of balls, and this mobile ball cleaner.

Caddie:
 Clean as a whistle, sir.

Peter:
 I'm not gonna get short by touching your spit, am I?

Caddie:
 You'd be the first, champ.

Peter:
 Well, it's about time.

Cleveland:
 Sorry, fellas. I'm not gonna be able to play. Loretta's mother is in town, and we have to go buy new sheets for the dog bed.

Loretta:
 Cleveland!

Cleveland:
 I mean, the pullout sofa bed.

Peter:
 Cleveland, this is Barrington. You could be the first black guy ever to play this course. People are gonna be impressed.

Loretta:
 Come on, Cleveland.

Brian:
 Maybe we should play another time.

Peter:
 Screw that. I busted my ass keeping Lois busy so I could be here. Now, let's grip it and rip it.

Golfer:
 The Fed will be lowering rates, get your money out of T-bills and put it all into <hit by ball> waffles! Tasty waffles with lots of syrup!

Broker:
 Waffles! Buy waffles!

Brokers:
Waffles! [All shouting]

Lois:
 Okay, kids. Keep your eyes peeled for a clue.

Stewie:
 Now what Jughead has done here, and it's really quite ingenious actually, is paint pupils on his eyelids, so he can sleep through class without Miss Grundy being any the wiser.

Chris:
 He's sleeping.

Meg:
 Mom, I found Dad's first clue.

Lois:
 I can't believe your father organized this. Usually he can't even handle simple tasks.

Lois:
 Peter, why is there a diaper in the lamp socket?

Stewie:
 Lois, he's done it again! Wait a minute. [Exclaims]

Brian:
 Let's pack it in. There's too much water out here.

Quagmire:
 Yeah. Let's hit the bar, huh?

Peter:
 Come on. There's worse things in life than rain. Like uh, like spiders.

Spider:
 He's behind the door!

Lois:
 [Coughing] Peter, he's bothering everyone. Say something.

Peter:
 Say something? I'll kick his ass. Someone ought to kick his ass.

Spider:
 Don't go in there!

Peter:
 All right. Give me a Kleenex.

Spider:
 I knew he was bad. I knew...ah!

Caddie:
 Out of me way! They're after me Lucky Charms!

Quagmire:
 I paid him $10 to say it. Classic.

Brian:
 We'll be in the clubhouse.

Peter:
 Go on, run away! More golf course for me! That was close. That looks dangerous. Somebody's gonna get hurt. [straining] It'll be fine.

BOTH:
 You again?

Peter:
 Death, please, don't take me now.

Death:
 DEATH: Relax. You're not dying. You're just having a near-death experience.

Peter:
 Thank God!

Death:
 Yeah, thank God. Thank God I get to hang out with a fascinating gent like yourself!

Peter:
 So, when am I gonna die?

Death:
 About two years after your wife divorces you.

Peter:
 What the hell are you talking about? Lois would never leave me. She's been crazy about me since the night we met.

Peter:
 My God, that's me! Look how thin I was!

Lois:
 My, this is certainly a beautiful night. I love looking at stars.

Peter:
 Say no more.

Lois:
 Peter, wait. I...

Peter:
 "Very interesting. But stupid."

Lois:
 Oh, my God! I love Arte Johnson!

Peter:
 Why don't you give him a kiss?

Lois:
 Peter, get away from me.

Lois:
 Stop it.

Peter:
 Give Arte Johnson a kiss.

Trucker:
 Oh, my God!

Lois:
 Peter, I hear music.

Peter:
 Yeah. Me, too. From now on, this'll be our song.

Lois:
 I've never met a guy like you. You're so full of life.

Lois:
 It's like I can really be myself with you. I'm so happy.

Peter:
 Man! She was beautiful.

Death:
 Say, this looks awfully familiar. Wait a second! I remember this! That's me! Look at all that hair. I can't believe I thought that looked good. I must have been high.

Peter:
 I love you, Lois Pewterschmidt.

Lois:
 I love you, Peter Griffin.

Peter:
 Look at that. Huh, huh? There's no way she's gonna leave me. Now put me back in my freakin' body, all right?

Death:
 I can't put you back until you have a revelation. You know, one of those things that changes your life.

Peter:
 To hell with this. I'm going home.

Death:
 What are you doing? You can't get in that way.

Peter:
 I'm sure as hell not going in the back door.

Death:
 Crap! I don't have time for this. Listen, I'm late for an appointment. If you don't want to follow procedure, fine. Stay here in limbo.

Peter:
 No. Wait. I don't want to be in limbo!

Lois:
 Okay. It says the next note will be right under my nose.

Announcer:
 And they're off! And quick out in front, Silver Dasher, followed by My Nose!

Lois:
 Aha! Hold my purse!

Chris:
 What's Mom doing?

Stewie:
 I'll tell you what she's doing, she's screwing up my six-two quinella. Damn it!

Announcer:
 My Nose in front, followed by Sea Biscuit, followed by Some Crazy Lady followed by Middle-Aged Housewife followed by Wait, Who's That? followed by Silver Dasher. And now it appears there's a woman chasing the dogs.

Lois:
 Let's go, kids!

Stewie:
 Blackie, tell the boys in Kansas City the bet's off.

Bettor:
 Too late, Stewie. The fix is in, and the noodles are boiling in the pot. Boiling, I tell you!

Stewie:
 Aaargh!

Peter:
 Wait a minute. I got it, I got it. I figured out my revelation: God loves a working man.

Death:
 No!

Peter:
 The Shadow is in reality Lamont Cranston, wealthy young man about town.

Death:
 No! Oh, crap! I'm late. I'm in big, big trouble!

Peter:
 Jeez, you're pretty shook up about that appointment of yours! You're Death. What are you afraid of?

 Death:
 Where the hell have you been? When I said lunch, I said noon, not noon-ish.

Death:
 Sorry, Ma.

 Death:
 Sorry? Is "sorry" gonna reheat the casserole? So, who's your friend?

Death:
 It's a work thing, Ma. Near-death experience.

 Death:
 Where are you going?

Death:
 I gotta take a leak.

 Death:
 Well, don't forget to zip up your fly. If you don't zip up your fly, a seagull will get you!

Death:
 God, she's a pain in the ass! I wish Dad was still dead.

Peter:
 I'll tell you, Lois' dad was a pain in the ass when I met him.

Peter:
 Hi. Can I take my tie off yet?

Lois:
 Peter, you look so wonderful. Are you nervous about meeting Daddy?

Peter:
 You'll know when I'm nervous.

Carter:
 Lois?

Peter:
 Now. Lois, take the rap for this. I only get one chance to make a first impression.

Lois:
 Hi, Daddy. That was me. And this is Peter.

Peter:
 Hey, Mr. Pewterschmidt. What are you feeding this gal? Peter Griffin. Can I take this freakin' tie off?

Carter:
 It's a pleasure. My daughter is quite taken with you.

Peter:
 And I'm taken with her. I mean, look at this. Show us front and back there, Lois. Don't think I don't know where that comes from. That's some world-class juice you got brewing in the old flesh balloon down there, Carter. Oh, yeah.

Lois:
 I'm gonna go get my purse.

Peter:
 All right. Hey, based on what you've seen with your wife what can we expect in terms of droopage here? We talking a slight slope or the full fried-eggs-hanging-on-a-nail thing?

Carter:
 Peter, what do you think of this bronze statue?

Peter:
 It's nice.

Carter:
 It's early Etruscan.

Peter:
 Get out of here!

Carter:
 No, seriously.

Peter:
 That's great.

Captain:
 Hey, look. A manatee!

Chef:
 We can use it for soup.

Quagmire:
 Ensign Glen Quagmire. Welcome aboard. You picked a great day to get rescued. We were just about to sing a song about mopping.

Sailors:
 ? We're mopping the deck, which is Navy for 'floor' ? ? And when we're done mopping, we'll mop it some more ? ? 'Swab' means 'mop,' 'deck' means 'floor'...?

 Death:
 Could you tell me when you're leaving to go back in time. I was talking to a robe on the coat rack for 20 minutes before I realized you weren't in it.

Death:
 Ma, for God's sake, leave me alone! I'm working!

Peter:
 Wow, brilliantly choreographed.

Quagmire:
 Well, that's your tax dollars at work. Hey, why don't you join us and see the world?

Peter:
 Sorry, pal. I've seen the world, and its name is Lois.

 Death:
 How romantic! Why can't you find a nice girl?

Death:
 Ma, she's gonna dump him.

 Death:
 Well, at least he got that far. You know who he took to the prom? His cousin!

Peter:
 That's weak.

 Death:
 Yeah.

Death:
 All right, all right, that's it! I'm sick of both of you. Come on, Peter.

 Death:
 Death, put your jacket on, or you'll get frostbite!

Death:
 I don't have skin!

 Death:
 'Cause you didn't eat your beans!

Death:
 Come on. Get back in your big, fat body. Why should I help a guy save his marriage when I can't even get a girl?

Peter:
 Whoa, wait! What are you saying?

Death:
 The revelation, jackass! It could have helped you save your marriage. But too late. And by the way, when the lightning hit you, you soiled yourself. Enjoy.

Peter:
 Wait. I can't lose Lois! Please, I'll do anything. What if I helped you get a girl?

Death:
 Really? You think you could do that?

Peter:
 Sure. All we gotta do is get you a little fixed up. Get you a haircut, give you a good clean...[Screams]...shave, maybe some cologne. The chicks'll be all over you.

Death:
 Gee! You really think so?

Peter:
 Absolutely. [Vomits]

Death:
 You got any SPF-50? I bleach like a gym sock.

Peter:
 Look, Death, will you relax? I told ya, the beach is a perfect place to pick up chicks. Now I want you to go over there, and ask those girls if you can play.

Death:
 Hey, can I join you?

Death:
 Josh.

Death:
 No. I live with my mom.

Man:
 Heads up!

Meg:
 How do we get up there? Dad put grease on the pole.

Chris:
 Don't worry, Meg. We've been studying fulcrums in school. You simply have to counter-balance the weight where the lever pivots. Like so.

Meg:
 Stewie, honey, want to play rocket ship?

Lois:
 Blast off! Go on, Stewie. Get the note for Mommy.

Stewie:
 How dare you use me for your own personal selfish...oh. Pull slower. I must remember to do this again when no one's around.

Death:
 What the hell was I thinking? You don't know anything about picking up chicks.

Peter:
 Are you kidding? I learned from the best.

Quagmire:
 Come on, buddy. We're dropping anchor in Jamaica!

Peter:
 Great! We're getting closer to Rhode Island.

Quagmire:
 Rhode Island? Forget that. I'm taking you out for some shore leave. Does this look like a "Q" to you?

Quagmire:
 How about now?

Peter:
 Sorry, Quagmire. Your crotch just looks like Lois to me.

Quagmire:
 Well, let's ask her then. Hey, Lois, should Peter sit around and mope all night? Or should Peter go out with his buddy and have some fun? All right!

Quagmire:
 Okay, that one's a feminist type. She's into he-men. And that one's mad for jazz. Watch this. "The plight of women in this hemisphere is deplorable!" "I can bench-press 800 pounds!" "You, me and Coltrane till dawn!" There you go, Peter. One for you, two for me.

Peter:
 You guys go on without me. [Sighs]

Death:
 Why didn't you go with them?

Peter:
 You don't know what love's like.

Death:
 Oh, yeah? Her name's Amy. She works at a pet store. I met her when her dad hung himself. But I was too shy to ask her out.

Peter:
 What's with that moustache?

Death:
 Let me see that. Sorry. That's Edward James Olmos. Here. This is her.

Peter:
 Hey, nice ass.

Death:
 Sorry. No. That's Edward James Olmos' ass. I guess I don't have a photo. But trust me, she's cute.

Peter:
 Well, let's go get her.

Death:
 I need that picture of Olmos' ass back

Peter:
 Oh, yeah, right.

Meg:
 Mom, hurry! I can't stand the smell!

Lois:
 I found the note! "Go back to the Mini-Mart"? Well, this isn't very creative. Let's go, kids.

Chris:
 Mom, you remember that goldfish we flushed down the toilet? He wasn't dead.

Death:
 There she is. That's her.

Peter:
 All right, now go on, like we practiced.

Amy:
 Hey, you.

Death:
 Hi. I was just, [animals going crazy] in the neighborhood and so I thought that you.... This is a bad time. Maybe I'll just come back. Who'm I kidding? I'll never get her.

Peter:
 Not with that attitude. Come on! Robert Reed got Florence Henderson, and he was one of thema toe-tapping Burgermeisters. You've gotta find a way to make it happen.

Quagmire:
 So long, Peter. I hope you find your girl.

Peter:
 Thanks, Quagmire. Hope you live next door to me someday.

Quagmire:
 Hey, does this look like a "Q" to you?

Cleveland:
 So, where is it you need to go, my new honky friend?

Peter:
 Rhode Island. That's not too far, is it?

Cleveland:
 Nothing's too far away from Maxine, the cheatin' queen. Women. That's not fair. I'm just speaking out of hurt. That truck's coming up on us awful fast.

Peter:
 Holy crap! Do you see what I see?

Cleveland:
 I'm afraid I do!

Death:
 So, you went through all this trouble to see your girl?

Peter:
 I sure did. And I'm just a fat idiot. What's your excuse, you big chicken?

Death:
 Chicken? You take that back!

Peter:
 Yeah? Make me!

Death:
 I don't make monkeys, I train 'em.

Peter:
 Holy crap! I'm sorry. Did that hurt?

Death:
 No. But this will!

Peter:
 You bastard!

Amy:
 What the hell is going on out here?

Death:
 Actually, I, uh...

Peter:
 He wanted to ask you something.

Death:
 Amy, you want to go somewhere and grab a coffee?

Amy:
 Sure. I get off at 2:00.

Death:
 Great! Great. I'll meet you here.

Peter:
 You did it! All right! Hey, who knows? You might even, you know...

Death:
 I'm not following you.

Peter:
 Intercourse.

Death:
 Ah.

Lois:
 What are you doing here?

Cleveland:
 Loretta's mom wanted a snack so we had to pick her up some Kibbles 'n' Bits.

Cleveland:
 I mean Cheezits.

Lois:
 Did Peter give you a clue for me?

Loretta:
 Peter? He's down at Barrington with Brian and Quagmire.

Lois:
 He's golfing on our anniversary?

Cleveland:
 Oh, boy! You just put Peter in the doghouse. Which is where your mother...

Loretta:
 Don't say it!

Cleveland:
 Your mother smells.

Death:
 See, this is why I hate clothes shopping. I have no ass. I'm minus an ass.

Peter:
 You're trying too hard, Death. She won't care what you're wearing. She's just gonna be glad to see you. That's how it was with Lois.

Peter:
 [Screams] Oh, God! Oh, God! [struggling] Hi, Mr. Pewterschmidt.

Carter:
 What the hell are you doing here?

Peter:
 It's a long story with some terrific performances and a wonderful scene at a carnival, but I'll cut to the ending. I want to marry Lois!

Carter:
 Out of the question! Now, listen, Griffin. I want you to take this, and stay away from my daughter forever!

Peter:
 $1 million?

Carter:
 $1 million.

Peter:
 No deal! Lois may be worth a million to you, but to me, she's worthless. I love her, Mr. Pewterschmidt.

Peter:
 Holy crap! Back then, I gave up $1 million just to be with Lois. Now I won't even miss a lousy golf game to spend our anniversary together. No wonder she's gonna dump me.

Death:
 Or is she?

Peter:
 Wait a minute. That's my revelation. I gotta pay more attention to my wife!

Death:
 Eureka! Now, come on back to the golf course. I've got a date.

Peter:
 Death, wait. Before we go, I need you to do me one more favor.

Death:
 <spectral voice> Peter! Peter Frampton!

Peter Frampton:
 Oh, no! God, please, no! I'm too young to die! Are you sure you're not supposed to be at Keith Richards' house?

Death:
 All right. If you want to live, come with me <back to normal voice> and bring your guitar, and bring that thing that makes it go... [Makes wah-wah sound]

Valet:
 Wait!

Lois:
 Damn! How could he lie to me on our anniversary?

Lois:
 Peter! Our song!

Peter:
 Happy anniversary, Lois.

Peter:
 This is the most romantic gift you've ever given me. How did you ever put all of this together?

Death:
 Well, I had a little help from a very special friend.

Amy:
 I like animals.

Death:
 Uh-huh.

Amy:
 Because they're like people. Just little furry people.

Death:
 Yeah. Hey, you ever go on the Internet? They got some cool stuff there on that Internet.

Amy:
 Oh, yeah, I bought these shoes from a company on the Internet because they don't test on animals.

Death:
 [sighs]

Amy:
 You know, animals never have war. War is an invention of mankind.

Death:
 What the hell are you talking about? Animals fight all the time!

Amy:
 Not with nuclear arms. You can't hug your children with nuclear arms.

Death:
 Check, please.

oe:
 Baby! Twelve in a row!

Peter:
 You must've had a great body before it went all funhouse mirror on you.

Lois:
 I can't believe how terrific you look.

Bonnie:
 Thanks. I've been taking tae-jitsu classes. You should come with me sometime.

Lois:
 I'd love to.

Bonnie:
 Oh, the baby's kicking. Want to feel?

Peter:
 Sure. Ow! Oh, You are freakin' dead, kid!

Meg:
 I love this time of year.

Brian:
 Me, too. The summer tourists are gone, and we finally have the town to ourselves before those idiots from New York show up to watch the leaves change and take over the whole place.

Brian:
 Leafers!

Peter:
 Holy crap! We gotta get outta here!

Bonnie:
 What about the boat?

Joe:
 Leave it!

Lois:
 Hurry, Peter! They're almost here!

Chris:
 We're too late!

Man:
 Yo, Matty. Check out those colors. Yellow like a taxi, orange like the ball at the Knicks game and red like the sauce on my Mamma Mia's cu cazz.

Matty:
 Yeah, and brown like the guys I don't pick up in my cab.

Man:
 Beautiful!

ALL:
 Aaahhh!

Diane Simmons:
 Good evening. Tonight's top story: Quahog is infested with loud, hairy creatures, also known as "New Yorkers."

Tom Tucker:
 They migrate north every autumn to see the foliage. I think I speak for all of us when I say New York and everyone from there can fornicate themselves with an iron stick.

Lois:
 We're gonna be late for church.

Peter:
 Move it! Damn leafers.

Meg:
 Chris, quit it! Mom, Chris put his foot on my side again!

Chris:
 I can't help it. I have these long dancer's legs.

Meg:
 Move it!

Stewie:
 Meg, stop whining! Chris, stay on your side! Lois, for God's sake, get off your ass and do some parenting!

Lois:
 If you kids don't knock it off, we're not going to McDonald's after church.

Both:
 Mom!

Peter:
 Don't worry, we're going. But you don't get the supersize.

Chris:
 Oh!

Peter:
 Okay, you can supersize, but no apple pie.

Meg:
 Come on!

Peter:
 Okay, you get an apple pie, but you can't blow on it.

Lois:
 Peter, don't contradict me in front of the kids!

Peter:
 Siblings fighting is as natural as a white man's dialogue in a Spike Lee movie.

Black Man:
 Wassup? Can I get two slices of pepperoni?

White Man:
 [Incoherent growling]

Lois:
 Who are all these people?

Peter:
 Damn New Yorkers! They took all the good seats.

Elderly Woman:
 Aren't you precious? [Screams]

Stewie:
 Some of my novelty items were provided by Jack's Joke Shop of South Attleboro, Massachusetts. Remember, "If it ain't funny, it ain't worth jack."

Priest:
 I'd like to welcome all our out-of-town parishioners. My cousin, Father Sapienza, is in from New York to see the leaves. And I'd like to invite him to do the opening prayer.

Father Sapienza:
 Yo! God is good, eh? And he expects us to be good. And if you're not, he's gonna come down and bust your freaking skull. Amen.

Man:
 Who do you think you're talking to? Your God ain't tougher than me!

Man:
 You wanna go, tough guy? I'll snap you in half like an almond biscotti from Valero's on 51st Street. Best in the city!

Peter:
 Fellas, this is God's house, and the Patriots kick off in about 45 minutes. Can we move this along?

Man:
 Patriots suck!

Peter:
 Blasphemy!

Man:
 It burns!

Scientist:
 Holy water? Where's that acid I ordered?

Stewie:
 Hey, Guido, watch this. I've got to lay off the coffee! Ha-cha-cha! That's Jack's, Exit 14 off 295.

Trainer:
 Tae-jitsu is about power for your body and your mind. Don't be afraid to free the beast inside you. Left kick, right kick, punch combo, stomp!

Trainer:
 Beautiful. Again. Left kick.

Trainer:
 You're doing great for your first lesson.

Lois:
 I'm really cutting loose. Just like Julie Andrews in that movie where she showed her breasts.

Boy:
 Oh, Mary. You'll never leave us, will you? Yes, those are lovely. But it doesn't quite answer our question.

Man:
 Jets rule!

Peter:
 Hey, watch where you're going, will you? Hey, Horace, put the Pats game on the TV, and get me a few beers, huh?

Horace:
 Sorry, Peter. Someone stole the remotes...and the kegs. And I'm not sure, but I think I've been shot. Yep.

Man:
 Hey, pal, watch my seat. I gotta bleed the lizard.

Cleveland:
 Public urination is just wrong. Except during the Million Man March when protesters burned our Porta-Potties. Then I used my stream of justice to put out the hate.

Quagmire:
 I don't know, fellas, I think there's potential in this crowd. Hey, honey, why don't you turn around and show me the Lower East Side?

Transvestite:
 Sure.

Quagmire:
 Whoa, transvestite! Back off! Wait a second. Pre-op or post-op?

Transvestite:
 Pre-op.

Quagmire:
 Whoa, transvestite! Back off! You're right. This place blows. We gotta send these straphangers back where they came from.

Peter:
 Don't worry. I got an idea. An idea so smart my head would explode if I even began to know what I was talking about.

Peter:
 [Angry growl] I am a man-eating tree. Go back to New York, or I will eat you! Just like I ate insane New York anchorman Dan Rather. And look who I had for dessert. Asexual former mayor Ed Koch. Leave my land, or I will smite you with my powerful limb.

Man:
 What are you, nuts? Gimme that branch. Get off of me!

Peter:
 Why you...

Lois:
 Oh, my God! Stop fighting!

Peter:
 Holy crap!

Chris:
 Mom, you could be a world champion, and no one could hit you below the belt because girls don't have anything down there. Can you teach me to kick ass?

Lois:
 Oh, no. I do not condone violence. And I am not gonna be responsible for bringing fist fighting into our schools.

Brian:
 Gee, Lois. Can you hear me all the way back there in the '50s?

Stewie:
 Well, that was lame.

Lois:
 Poor Peter. I emasculated him in front of all those people. I think he's really upset.

Peter:
 Gather around, everybody. $10 is all it takes! Step right up and fight my wife! Come one, come all. She floats like a butterfly and stings like when I pee.

Lois:
 Peter, I am not a sideshow attraction, at least not anymore.

Lois:
 Me likey bouncy. Me likey bouncy.

Lois:
 I want you to get rid of all this right now because I am never fighting again. Ever!

Peter:
 Come on, Chris. We'll have to go to Plan B.

Chris:
 [growling] Oh, no! Ah! Oh, God! Oh, my God! Help me! Help me, for God's sake! He's gonna kill me! Help!

Peter:
 Don't worry. It's a trained bear. He's in no real danger.

Lois:
 He's teaching a class. I can't bother him now.

Peter:
 Sure you can. Hey! Hey, Ralph Macchio! My wife here needs to talk to you. There you go, honey.

Trainer:
 What is it, Lois?

Lois:
 I-I don't think I should do tae-jitsu anymore. I'm afraid I'm gonna hurt someone.

Trainer:
 But, Lois, you're my star pupil. I want you in my advanced class.

Lois:
 Advanced class? No, no, no, no. I'm trying to quit.

Trainer:
 Fine, quit. But get used to people walking all over you.

Peter:
 Wait, hold on there. Nobody walks all over my wife, because I won't let them.

Peter:
 Quiet, Lois. Men are talking. She learns things eventually, it just takes her longer. Come on, honey, we're outta here. If you hurry, I'll let you try on hats. I won't let you buy, but you can try 'em on.

Lois:
 I'll do it.

Lucy:
 [Sobbing]

Lois:
 Stewie, you want to swing?

Stewie:
 Yes. Why not? I'll have a go at it. Perhaps a quick stretch first. Damn! Must've pulled something playing hoops last week.

Stewie:
 I know you're not putting that rock up from here. You ain't got no J.

Player:
 Yo, man! That's trippin'!

Stewie:
 Brother, please! You're the one who's trippin'! Go on, cry home to your mama! She waitin' for ya.

Player:
 Now don't make me put my size 13s up your narrow ass!

Stewie:
 I don't sweat you! You bring it on, bitch! Now, how you gonna act? Bring that trash in here! This is my house!

Lois:
 Excuse me. We were about to use that.

Woman:
 You snooze, you lose, lady.

Lois:
 You have two choices. Either my baby swings from this jungle gym, or you do.

Stewie:
 Whoo, Lois! Someone's wearing their ovaries on the outside!

Lois:
 She saw me walking to the swing!

Stewie:
 Yes, she saw you. Easy now.

Lois:
 Nobody walks all over me! Those days are over! Lois demands respect!

Stewie:
 [Screams] I smell a messy diaper. God! Why does that turn me on?

Chris:
 Hold it, Meg. Those two are mine.

Chris:
 That's Randy and that's Fred. Randy is the messy one. Fred's very neat. When you get them together, hoo-hoo, hold onto your sides.

Meg:
 Nice to meet you both.

Chris:
 Murderer!

Lois:
 Stop it, both of you! Starting now, you two are gonna love each other! Now stay that way.

Chris:
 It's gonna be weird to potty.

Peter:
 Sheesh, Lois, look at the garbage those damn leafers dumped on our lawn. New York Post, New York Magazine, the New York Mets.

Lois:
 Peter, I'm sick and tired of hearing you whine about the leafers! Take some action! Free the beast!

Quagmire:
 That was strangely arousing. [shouts] [Grunts] Hello, 911? It's Quagmire. Yeah. Yeah. It's in a window this time.

Brian:
 Wow, look at them run.

Peter:
 Wait a second, Brian. That gives me an idea.

Lois:
 The Drunken Clam? Why couldn't we go someplace fancy like The Olive Garden? Oh, the breadsticks. Me likey breadsticks! Me likey- <to self> You're a big girl now. Stop it!

Peter:
 Hold on, Lois. Excuse me, New Yorker. I think you're in my seat, and I had sex with your mother last night.

Lois:
 Peter, are you crazy?

Man:
 What did you say?

Peter:
 About the seat, or about my plowing your father's wife?

Lois:
 What the hell are you doing?

Peter:
 Excuse me. Is your refrigerator running? Because if it is, it probably runs like you. Very homosexually.

Man:
 What?

Lois:
 You wanna dance?

Peter:
 Jets suck! Yankees suck! Knicks suck! Krypton sucks! That's right. Go back where you came from, you bastards.

Trainer:
 We'll conclude today's graduation ceremony with a demonstration by the black belts. Okay, people, let's show them what we've learned. Kathy, get in there with Lois.

Kathy:
 I can't. I have cramps.

Lois:
 Why are you putting me up against the scrubs, Jared? Why don't you be a man and fight me yourself?

Trainer:
 Lois, the sensei is a sacred position. I could never violate the spiritual bond of the student-master relationship.

Lois:
 Oh. Then allow me.

Trainer:
 The bond is broken!

Lois:
 Then spin the wheel, Raggedy Man!

Stewie:
 Go, Lois! Pummel him with your powerful fists of female fury! And then when he's weary, emasculate him with your incessant nagging! Women! Yakety, yak, yak, yak. You know. Enjoy the fight.

Lois:
 [Cry of victory]

Peter:
 Lois, that was amazing! Congratul-

Lois:
 This is mine! This is where my babies come from!

Announcer:
 And now back to the Movie of the Week: Speed 3 - Glacier of Doom.

Man:
 If this glacier goes slower than one mile a year, we're all dead!

Woman:
 Tell me something I don't know! Get out of the way!

Peter:
 Lois, I was watching that. What you looking at?

Lois:
 The underpants, lose 'em!

Peter:
 Actually, I sort of have a headache, kinda. See, maybe tomorrow, or...

Lois:
 Take 'em off!

Peter:
 Yeah. Okay, honey.

Stewie:
 Whoa! What the hell are you doing? Those are my graham crackers!

Peter:
 Run along, Stewie. Daddy had a rough night.

Stewie:
 Why you tottering, femme-sucked dewberry. I'm going to go find something to strike you with. Excuse me.

Brian:
 Good morning. Peter, you look terrible. What happened?

Peter:
 Last night, Lois was the man!

Brian:
 Good Lord!

Peter:
 I just want you to know, Brian-I didn't cry.

Brian:
 It's okay.

Lois:
 Oh, no! Peter! Stewie, what did you do?

Brian:
 Looks like he freed the beast all over the back of Peter's head.

Lois:
 Oh, my God. This is my fault. This is my fault. I brought violence into this house! I am the worst mother in the world!

Stewie:
 Aha! I got it all on tape! Okay. This is me interviewing Ed Sullivan. What's new, Ed? [Imitating Ed Sullivan] "Well, Stewie, tonight we have a really big show." Okay. And now a word from our sponsors. "It takes a very steady hand. Don't touch the sides! Butter fingers." I was making radio shows for fun. Everybody does it. Everybody I know...shut up!

Psychologist:
 Now, Stewart, I want you to take this Mommy doll and this Daddy doll and show me how they act together.

Stewie:
 Yes. Very well. All right. "You see, Margaret, after 20-odd years of marriage, your curious indiscretions no longer phase me." "Really? And I suppose you think I enjoy hanging onto those hammocky deposits of gin sugars you call buttocks?" What was that? What did you just write there?

Psychologist:
 Give me that!

Stewie:
 "Insecurity? Gender confusion?" I'll give you something to write about! Ooh, look at me! I'm insane! I'm Martin Lawrence on a bender!

Psychologist:
 Mr. and Mrs. Griffin, does Stewart have a history of aggression?

Lois:
 No, no. Hitting Peter is the first violent thing he's ever done.

Stewie:
 Technically, the first act of violence was that time bomb I left ticking in your uterus before I came out. Happy 50th birthday, Lois.

Psychologist:
 It's obvious that your son is learning this behavior from someone.

Peter:
 I know who's responsible for Stewie's behavior. But if I told you who it was, Lois would beat the crap out of me.

Lois:
 Now, just a minute! The whole reason I started fighting is because of you! I felt weak! You never listen to me! You undermine me in front of the kids! And besides, you're not exactly Father Of The Year yourself.

Psychologist:
 Well, there seems to be a lot of anger in your household. You owe it to your son to learn how to manage these feelings.

Stewie:
 Manage what?

Lois:
 I know I went a little overboard with my tae-jitsu. But from now on, we're not gonna have any more anger in this house, okay?

Meg:
 Well, then tell Chris to quit drawing pictures of me with a pig's body.

Chris:
 Don't censor me!

Lois:
 No more anger! Okay. The psychologist wants us to try an exercise called "role reversal," where we pretend to be the person who makes us angry. I'll go first. "Don't listen to your mother, kids. She's worthless and dumb, and ignore her, and only listen to me-Peter."

Peter:
 "I'm Lois. I brake for yard sales. But I don't let Peter buy anything he likes. Like that Narragansett beer stein where the hot chick has two mugs for jugs." It was eight freakin' dollars, and we have a dozen places to put it!

Stewie:
 Oh, oh, me next, me next! "I'm the dog. I'm well-read and have a diverse stock portfolio. But I'm not above eating grass clippings and regurgitating them on the small braided rug near the door."

Brian:
 "I'm a pompous little anti-Christ who will probably abandon my plans for world domination when I grow up and fall in love with a rough trick named Jim."

Brian:
 Whoa, whoa, Peter, calm down.

Peter:
 I'm sick of Lois' anger-management techniques, Brian. They're not working.

Brian:
 What about the writing-angry-letters- and-not-sending-them exercise?

Peter:
 Aw, jeez, I wasn't supposed to send those?

Meg:
 Look. I got a letter from Dad. "Dear Meg, for the first four years of your life, I thought you were a housecat." Dad!

Stewie:
 "Dear Stewie, get out." Oh, that's nice.

Lois:
 Mine just says, "Dear Lois." And after that, it looks like someone just spit on the paper! You got something to say to me?

Peter:
 Yeah. PS... [Deep snort] Hold on a second.

Brian:
 Hold on, hold on. Relax. Everybody, relax. All right, look, I was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but we need to get our anger under control before we kill each other. No, my psychiatrist gave me these pills. They're mood elevators. I think they could help...even us out.

Lois:
 We're not taking pills. It's not natural.

Peter:
 Neither is bleaching the hair on your upper lip, Martin Mull!

Lois:
 Give us the pills!

ALL:
 Oom, bop bop.

Lois:
 That was fun. What country should we do next?

Chris:
 Monaco! Oh, wait. That's a principality.

Brian:
 You guys want to hear something really funny? Those pills I gave you were placebos. Sugar pills!

Peter:
 Wait a minute. Are you telling me I sang Ladysmith Black Mambazo for nothing?

Lois:
 Did it kill you to be multi-cultural for a minute?

Peter:
 I died a little inside, yes. You happy now?

Lois:
 Don't you use that tone of voice, you...

Peter:
 What were you going to say? "Fat ass"?

Chris:
 "Wide load"?

Meg:
 "Dough boy"?

Stewie:
 "Country virtuoso Roy Clark"?

Lois:
 How about "all of the above"?

Peter:
 How is this for a name? "Miss, Pony Express is in." "What do you got for me, Joe?" "Let me see here. It's here somewhere. Here we are. A big bag of liver spots for Lois!"

Peter:
 You just hit me.

Lois:
 That's right! You can't hit me! I'm a girl!

Peter:
 Sometimes I wonder. Kicking, Lois?

Lois:
 Hurts, doesn't it?

Peter:
 You tell me.

Chris:
 Go, Dad! Kick her ass!

Meg:
 Shut up! This is all Dad's fault!

Chris:
 I don't like to be touched!

Brian:
 [Laughing] Man, I'm glad we got that out of our systems.

Meg:
 I wonder what came over us?

Chris:
 Maybe people are naturally violent.

Lois:
 I don't believe that. I think it's all the TV we watch. There's so much violence.

Peter:
 Yeah. TV is dangerous. Why doesn't the hell doesn't the government step in and tell us what we can and can't watch? And shame on the network that puts this junk on the air!

Lois:
 Peter? Peter, maybe you shouldn't say anything bad about the network.

Peter:
 Why? What are they gonna do? Cut our budget? I'm gonna go get a beer.

Lois:
 Oh, my! This place is enormous!

Peter:
 Oh, man! They got these little plastic disc guns! I haven't seen one of these since Cleveland's wedding.

Priest:
 Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to celebrate the joining of these two young people...

Peter:
 [Peter laughing]

Priest:
 ...in the bonds of holy matrimony...

Priest:
 ...consecrated before God Almighty.

Brian:
 Hey! Stratego! I used to love this game. Oh, my God! Abe Vigoda?

Abe Vigoda:
 Go bother Steve Guttenberg. He's behind the Chinese checkers.

Steve Guttenberg:
 Abe, shut up!

Peter:
 Hey, look at me, Chris! I'm Yanni, sans the attitude.

Holden Caufield:
 My God, that's amazing! You are so talented.

Peter:
 Huh?

Holden Caufield:
 Wait a second! Something's not right here. You were just making it look like you were playing. You're a phony! Hey! This guy's a great big phony.

Peter:
 Come on, Chris.

Peter:
 There you are.

Holden Caufield:
 You're a great big phony. You know that?

Peter:
 Come on, Stewie. Your mom and I have something for you.

Stewie:
 Let me guess. You picked out another colorful box with a crank that I'm expected to turn and turn until big shock, a jack pops out. You laugh, the kids laugh, the dog laughs and I die a little inside.

Lois:
 Surprise, honey!

Stewie:
 A trikie!

Peter:
 I think he likes it!

Chris:
 When I stick this army guy with the sharp bayonet up my nose it tickles my brain. Ow! Oh, now I don't know math.

Stewie:
 Give it to me! Give it to me now, damn it!

Lois:
 Not now, Stewie. When we get home.

Holden Caufield:
 That's right! You're a big, fat phony!

Neil:
 What I'm about to show you is a fight scene from Star Trek, Season 1, Episode 18. And as a bonus I'll identify when it's Shatner and when it's his stunt double, Fred Lubbins. That's Shatner, of course. That's Lubbins. Then that's Shatner. That's Lubbins. That's Shatner. That's Lubbins. Now, that's Shatner, but when I freeze-frame you can clearly see Lubbins' coffee cup on that rock.

Meg:
 He is the biggest dork on the planet.

Girl:
 Oh, totally.

Neil:
 And so, because of his rough-and-tumble style of command, Captain Kirk is clearly superior to Jean-Luc Picard. Any questions? Meg?

Meg:
 No! Leave me alone!

 McCloud:
 Thank you, Neil, for that totally irrelevant presentation. We all know Captain Picard is the superior officer.

Girl:
 Hey, everybody! Mr. Lassenbee's getting arrested!

Students:
 [Students chattering]

Principal Shepherd:
 What in God's name? Mr. Lassenbee, what the hell's going on here?

 Lassenbee:
 Apparently, there's some law against teaching the evolutionary theory that Gil Gerard used a time machine, went back, and ejaculated into the primordial ooze.

Principal Shepherd:
 This stupid country.

Tom Tucker:
 Hello. Tom Tucker live at James Woods High School with this sensational breaking story. A teacher caught molesting children...with crackpot theories. Full story at 11:00.

Camerman:
 And out.

Meg:
 Oh, my God! That's Tom Tucker from the news!

Tom Tucker:
 Hey, kids. Remember, Mr. T says, "I pity the fool who does drugs."

Camerman:
 Better hurry up, Mr. Tucker.

Tom Tucker:
 I'm coming.

Diane Simmons:
 And reports indicate she has also consumed a record amount of seamen.

Tom Tucker:
 Well, that sounds like one powerful hurricane, Diane. In other news, school-board elections took place last evening. And with six precincts reporting, candidate Fred Johnson leads candidate...

Tom Tucker:
 Hi, Meg. You know how cute I think you are.

Tom Tucker:
 Turmoil at the White House when President Bush stuck his finger in an electrical socket.

Brian:
 Whoa! Yikes! Awkward.

Tom Tucker:
 "Cheney told me that's where leprechauns hide their gold." More at 11.

Holden Caufield:
 You know who lives in this house? A great big phony! That's right! A phony lives here! A big fat phony!

Stewie:
 I say! Look at me! I feel like a regular grease monkey!

Grease Monkey:
 Hey, remember that time I had that Mustang?

Stewie:
 Oh, yeah! You took her for a spin that time.

Grease Monkey:
 Yeah, that was awesome!

Stewie:
 Then those chowderheads on the corner busted your stones.

Grease Monkey:
 [Laughing]

Stewie:
 Hey, your sister say anything about me?

Meg:
 Oh, my God! I'm missing the news!

Peter:
 We all miss The News, Meg. But Huey Lewis needs time to create, and we have to learn to be patient.

Diane Simmons:
 And in entertainment, Mary Tyler Moore is 64 years old today.

Tom Tucker:
 Really? 64?

Diane Simmons:
 Yes.

Tom Tucker:
 Now I thought she was dead.

Diane Simmons:
 Nope. She's alive.

Tom Tucker:
 Fantastic! And now this.

Tom Tucker:
 Are you a high-school student interested in the glamorous world of unpaid internships? If so, we'd like to invite you to try out for Channel 5's Young Anchor Program.

Meg:
 Oh, wow!

Diane Simmons:
 You'll gain valuable experience, have a chance to work closely with Tom and me and best of all, produce your own on-air report.

Tom Tucker:
 So, call us now.

Both:
 Yeah!

Announcer:
 Channel Five is not responsible for anyone burned, maimed, impaled, or molested during actual internship.

Tom Tucker:
 All right, question number one. Would you consider growing a moustache?

Boy:
 I guess so.

Tom Tucker:
 Question number two. Look at my moustache. Do you think it tickles women when I kiss them?

Boy:
 I don't know.

Tom Tucker:
 Wrong. The answer is "only slightly." Only slightly. Next!

Diane Simmons:
 [Thinking] Oh, God! I can't hire any of these girls. They're all too pretty. Their breasts are too perky. Perfect! [aloud] Congratulations! You got the job.

Meg:
 Oh, my God! Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! This is beyond anything I've ever dreamed of.

Diane Simmons:
 You and your partner will start first thing tomorrow after school.

Meg:
 Great! Who's my partner?

Neil:
 Hey there, hot stuff!

Neil:
 Well, well. It appears the fates have conspired in our favor, eh, Meg?

Meg:
 Look! Stay away from me, Neil! Just because we work together doesn't mean I have to like you. Give it to me!

Neil:
 What's that?

Meg:
 Give it to me, Neil!

Meg on tape:
 Give it to me! Give it to me, Neil!

Neil:
 Yeah. That'll work just fine.

Tom Tucker:
 Hey, look who's here, Diane. It's our bright-eyed young interns. Did you two remember to wear your eager caps?

Meg:
 I sure did, Mr. Tucker!

Diane Simmons:
 Great! 'Cause you two are gonna have so much fun!

Tom Tucker:
 Don't act any cheerier, Diane. You'll give us all diabetes.

Diane Simmons:
 Bite me, Tom.

Tom Tucker:
 Come on, kids! And here's where we produce our in-studio celebrity interviews. I just did one with Dustin Hoffman. He's impossible to book, but we got him.

Tom Tucker:
 So, Dustin, it's been a while. I got to say, you look great.

Dustin Hoffman:
 [seduction scene from "The Graduate"] Are you trying to seduce me...

Voice:
 ...Mr. Tucker?

Tom Tucker:
 I am not trying to seduce you, Dustin Hoffman. You really look great.

Dustin Hoffman:
 [scene from "Rain Man"] Uh-oh! Twelve minutes to Wapner.

Tom Tucker:
 Yes, I understand your hectic schedule. Well, Dustin, we really appreciate you taking the time to be with us here in the studio. If there's anything I can do for you...

Dustin Hoffman:
 [scene from "Hook"] Bring me Peter Pan!

Tom Tucker:
 I'll keep my eye out for him. Thanks, Dustin.

Tom Tucker:
 He's this tall.

Lois:
 Can you believe it? Our little Stewie learning to ride his first tricycle.

Peter:
 Yeah, this is gonna be even more exciting than when Brian taught me about Christopher Columbus.

Peter:
 Where we going, Brian?

Brian:
 Well, Peter, we're going to visit the year 1492. That's when Columbus set sail on his famous voyage to the New World.

Peter:
 Hey, we're on a ship!

Brian:
 That's right, Peter. This is the Santa Maria, one of three ships Columbus took to find a direct route to India.

Columbus:
 Any sign of India yet, fellows?

Sailor:
 Nothin' yet, Captain.

Peter:
 India? But I thought Columbus was going to America.

Brian:
 On the contrary, Peter. Columbus discovered America entirely by mistake.

Peter:
 Wow!

Stewie:
 What the deuce do you think you're doing? Back off, fat man!

Peter:
 Hang on, Stewie!

Stewie:
 What the... Hey, let go! Get your filthy paws off! Let go! Let go, I say! Let-don't let go! Oh, this is exhilarating!

Lois:
 Go, Stewie!

Peter:
 Yea, Stewie!

Lois:
 Here, I gotta check on dinner. You keep taping Stewie. Don't miss a moment.

Peter:
 I got it. Look! It's dancing with me! It's like there's this incredibly benevolent force that wants me to know there's no reason to be afraid. Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world, it makes my heart burst.

God:
 It's just some trash blowing in the wind! Do you have any idea how complicated your circulatory system is?

Meg:
 Hi, Mr. Tucker. I brought you some Rice Krispie treats 'cause I remember you saying you liked them on the news. See, look. This one is in the shape of a heart.

Tom Tucker:
 I'm sorry, but there's a handsome man in my spoon. You'll have to come back later.

Meg:
 [Meg sighing]

Neil:
 Oh, my God! Meg's in love with Tom Tucker! Try to move in on my woman, will you, Tom Tucker? Well, no one crosses Neil Goldman and gets away with it! I added a little something to your coffee that I don't think you're gonna like. Here's your coffee, Mr. Tucker.

Tom Tucker:
 What the hell is in this?

Neil:
 Sweet'N Low! That's for trying to steal my woman!

Tom Tucker:
 Go back and bring it to me with urine in it like I asked!

Neil:
 Yes, sir.

Bully:
 Nice bike.

Stewie:
 Oh, if that's not the understatement of the century.

Bully:
 It's cool. Too cool for you!

Stewie:
 No, no. I think it's right where I'm at.

Bully:
 Out of my way!

Stewie:
 I see. I suppose you do have to ride it to truly appreciate its virtues. Well then, I'll just wait here till you get back. Where the devil is he?

Brian:
 You've obviously never met a bully.

Stewie:
 What do you mean, "bully"?

Brian:
 He wasn't taking it for a test ride. He was just taking it.

Stewie:
 You mean.... He stole my trikie! [Crying]

Meg:
 You know, Mr. Tucker, has anyone ever told you your eyes are...

Tom Tucker:
 Hang on, sweetie. I've got to call Peter Jennings and reschedule our golf game.

Peter Jennings:
 This is Peter. You know what to do.

Producer:
 Mr. Tucker? Miss Simmons? There's some nut on top of Town Hall with a high-powered rifle! The gunman has been identified as the notorious Mass-media Murderer who targets members of the press.

Tom Tucker:
 Whoa! "Mass-media Murderer"? You know, I think this would be a fine opportunity to give our interns real-world experience.

Diane Simmons:
 Hey! That means you'll get to ride in the Action 5 News chopper! I'm so jealous! Better put in for new interns. Good luck!

Gunman:
 I've got Hugh Downs up here! And I'm gonna splatter his distinguished career all over the pavement!

Hugh Downs:
 Why me? Why the media?

Gunman:
 I've got my reasons! Dan Rather thinks he can just condense a day's worth of events into a half hour.

Hugh Downs:
 Don't get me started on Rather. That arrogant jerk.

Gunman:
 Really? You know him?

Hugh Downs:
 Well, I'm Hugh Downs. I know everybody. In fact, he's right down there.

Gunman:
 Where?

Hugh Downs:
 Ha-ha! See you later, sucker! And, by the way, Rather is an okay guy in small doses.

Neil:
 Look how close we're getting, Meg!

Gunman:
 Hey! That was my lucky assassin hat!

Pilot:
 Mayday! Mayday! I'm going down!

Meg:
 Oh, my God, we're gonna die! There's so much of life I haven't experienced! I never even got the chance to be some drunk college guy's last resort!

Neil:
 My years of expensive orthodontic work will be a total waste!

Meg:
 I never even had my first kiss!

Neil:
 It's not too late, Meg.

Neil:
 I'm here for you.

Gunman:
 Time to sign off.

Hugh Downs:
 Remember me, dirt bag?

Man:
 Wow! You saved those kids' lives, Mr. Downs!

Hugh Downs:
 All in a day's work. Remember, if you ever need me, just blow this whistle or call John Stossel's cell phone. Hugh Downs away!

Lois:
 Honey, thank God you're safe! We were so worried.

Diane Simmons:
 We now go to Junior Anchor Neil Goldman with exclusive Channel 5 footage from today's exciting scene.

Neil:
 Thank you, Diane. There may have been some sort of commotion on the rooftop, but the real story was inside the mouths of Meg Griffin and Neil Goldman where a meeting of the tongues-a summit of saliva-established a new world order of love.

Meg:
 [Screams]

Neil:
 Let's watch it one more time in super slow-mo! This is where we cease to be Meg and Neil, and begin life anew as "Meil."

Meg:
 Oh, my God! He put it on TV?

Lois:
 Isn't that cute, Peter? Our daughter's first love.

Meg:
 I just want to kill myself! I'm going upstairs right now and eat a whole bowl of peanuts! I'm allergic to peanuts! You don't know anything about me!

Stewie:
 I say, constable, I'd like to report the theft of my tricycle.

Cop:
 Oh, look at the little baby. Aren't you cute? Where's your mommy?

Stewie:
 How dare you condescend to me! I demand justice!

Man:
 I'm here to turn myself in. I have a dismembered Baltic hooker bleeding through the tarp in my trunk.

Kids:
 [Laughing]

Meg:
 Where did you get that shirt?

Girl:
 Neil's giving them out.

Neil:
 Hello, lover.

Meg:
 Neil! What are you doing? I'm not your lover! I don't even like you!

Neil:
 Meg, I strongly suggest you hold my hand, lest you look like a slut.

Meg:
 Listen, you freak! Tell these people that there's nothing going on between us!

Neil:
 Oh, don't be afraid of the fire, Meg. I won't let you burn. Al? Why haven't I leaped?

Al:
 Ziggy says you can't "leap" until she loves you back.

Neil:
 Don't worry. I'll get her.

Personal trainer:
 So what were you wanting to work on? Cardio, upper body, what?

Stewie:
 Upper body, definitely. I need to get buff to get my tricycle back.

Personal trainer:
 Luckily we're running a special right now for the next 17 minutes.

Stewie:
 That's a little unusual, but okay, tell me.

Personal trainer:
 The normal plan is 78 months at $40 a month, and $200 down. Watch this. Forget the down. Watching? Good-bye $40 a month. Let's do $35.

Stewie:
 Okay, $35. Now, that's the cheapest?

Personal trainer:
 Hang on. Trace, can you bring me some of those free gym bags? Thanks.

Stewie:
 I can probably just do some pushups at home...

Personal trainer:
 Okay, well, let's start with the complete body-fat test, maybe a heart rate...

Stewie:
 You're actually not hearing me. I don't think this is for me. Thanks anyway. And for the future? You came on a little strong.

Meg:
 What's going on here?

Lois:
 Oh, we invited Neil's family over for dinner.

Mort:
 Hi!

Muriel:
 Hello!

Meg:
 You what?

Peter:
 Yeah, we wanted to get to know 'em better. You know, seeing as how the two of you will one day bless our home with the pitter-patter of sweet little grandchildren as ugly as sin.

Neil:
 You never told me your mother was such a stone-cold fox! Now I see where you get it.

Lois:
 Meg, he's so charming.

Chris:
 My name is Chris. I'm supposed to be on my best behavior tonight, and not mention poo. Oh, God! What have I done?

Peter:
 Well, let's eat.

Mort:
 I think it's very, very nice that our children had this wonderful kiss. I remember when Muriel and I had our first kiss. And it was just awful. Oh, just awful. We were both very sick, weren't we, dear?

Muriel:
 We were terribly sick. We were both 14, and it was winter, and we had terrible head colds.

Mort:
 Yes. Mine especially was very bad. I had terrible mucus coming out from inside my nose. And the other children, they were very nasty to me about that. They said bad, hurtful things to me. They called me "Tasty Cakes" and they would beat me and stick pine cones in my ass. Those were very bad times.

Lois:
 Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

Mort:
 Thank you very much.

Meg:
 Excuse me. I'm gonna go throw up.

Mort:
 Please flush the toilet twice. Once for the bulk, and again for the remainder. Thank you. Oh, she's a dear.

Bully:
 Hey, you're blocking my light, you stupid baby!

Stewie:
 You know, my hooligan friend, I've been racking my brain in a thus far fruitless attempt to resolve our recent unpleasantness. Then it dawned on me. Your cruelty merely stems from some deep-seated inner pain. So, the obvious remedy is a healthy dose of outer pain!

Tom Tucker:
 School children washing cars to raise money for charity. Is there anything more arousing? Finally, we go to Meg Griffin for a special Channel 5 Junior Anchor Segment on the moon. Meg?

Meg:
 The moon. There's a reason no one goes there. It's cold. And it's ugly. And its surface is plagued with deep craters and jagged peaks. Oh, wait! That's not the moon. It's Neil Goldman's face. Recently, many of you saw me kissing this freak of nature. But, if I didn't think I was seconds away from death, I would have never done it. I mean, who in their right mind would? Well, I went to the streets to find out. Would you kiss this guy?

Girl:
 Ugh, no.

Mort:
 God, no! What's the matter with you? Ugh!

Meg:
 It's official. Neil Goldman is unkissable. Hear that, Neil? I don't like you, and I never will! Back to you, Tom.

Tom Tucker:
 Thank you, Meg. I guess beggars can be choosers. And now this.

Stewie:
 Well, well. Isn't this a darling picture?

Bully:
 Let me go, man!

Stewie:
 Tell me, how old are you, Charlie?

Bully:
 7.

Stewie:
 7? My, my, you're practically a lady. Ironic that your fate is in the hands of an infant. Now tell me where my tricycle is!

Bully:
 I don't know. I lost it.

Stewie:
 Very well. I have other ways of obtaining the truth.

Bully:
 No! Don't!

Lois:
 Stewie? Look what I found.

Stewie:
 My trikie!

Lois:
 What's going on down here?

Stewie:
 We're playing house.

Lois:
 That boy is all tied up.

Stewie:
 Roman Polanski's house.

Tom Tucker:
 <practicing line reads> "Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker. Our top story, the President has been shot." "Tragedy strikes the nation. The President has been shot." "What's the President doing in this casket? We'll tell you right after this." Hey, Meg, nice job on that report last night.

Meg:
 Wow! Thanks, Mr. Tucker. That means so much coming from someone as handsome as yourself.

Tom Tucker:
 Say, how'd you like to pick up a handsome man's dry cleaning?

Meg:
 Well, sure. But isn't that Neil's job?

Tom Tucker:
 Little jerk hasn't been in all day.

Meg:
 He hasn't?

Producer:
 We got a breaking story! There's some geek on top of Town Hall and he's about to jump!

Meg:
 Oh, my God! Neil!

Tom Tucker:
 Is it Neil? Huh. I've been calling him Ned all week.

Meg:
 Oh, my God! Neil, please don't jump.

Neil:
 I was just a piece of eye candy that she turned into an all-day sucker.

Meg:
 Mr. Tucker! Thank God you're here! Someone's gotta do something! He'll fall!

Tom Tucker:
 I'm on it, Meg. Hey, have that cartoon sound-effect guy cue up the [whistling], then top it off with a [splat]. And if there's time before commercial, be ready with a [sentimental music].

Meg:
 Oh, my God! You don't care about him at all, do you? All you care about are your stupid ratings! You're a horrible man! Neil, I'm sorry!

Neil:
 Meg?

Horace:
 There he goes!

Tom Tucker:
 Good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff!

Meg:
 Neil!

Neil:
 Meg, you do care!

Meg:
 Don't read too much into this, Neil.

Neil:
 Well, it's hard not to when I'm lying right on top of you.

Meg:
 Look-just because you're repulsive and the most annoying person on the planet-and I'm not the only one who thinks so-that doesn't mean I want you to kill yourself.

Neil:
 Thanks, Meg. But I was never really planning to jump.

Holden Caufield:
 Wasn't gonna jump? You're a phony! Hey, everybody! This guy's a great big phony!

Mort:
 On the whole, I enjoy my job as a pharmacist. In fact, many of my customers are your mommies and daddies. Jimmy Hopkins, your mother had awful postpartum depression after you were born. And Danielle, your father had bad, very bad hemorrhoids that stung him unmerciful. Oh, they were awful. They were like stinky little balloons. And I gave him some special ointment and he hurt so bad that he had to apply it in the car with his sock. Thank you.

Boy:
 Cool! I want to be a pharmacist!

Teacher:
 Thank you, Mr. Goldman. And our final speaker is Mr. Peter Griffin.

Chris:
 [Cheering]

Peter:
 Hey, kids! Hey, you know what I do? I work at a toy factory and you know what I do there?

Boy:
 I bet you're just one of those low-level assembly-line guys who stands there all day screwing heads on dolls. "Ooh, is it on straight? I don't know." Boo!

Peter:
 Why, you little snot-nosed...

Teacher:
 Mr. Griffin! [Whispering] He plays kickball in the park after school. Get him there. [aloud] Does anyone have any questions for Mr. Griffin?

Boy:
 Yeah. Can we listen to the claims adjuster again?

Class:
 [Cheering]

Tom Tucker:
 Welcome back to Quahog 5 News. And now, here's Ollie Williams with the "Blaccuweather" Forecast. Ollie?

Ollie Williams:
 It gonna rain!

Tom Tucker:
 Thanks. And finally, we go live to Asian reporter Trisha Takanawa interviewing a guy from the upcoming Renaissance Faire.

Tricia Takanawa:
 Thanks, Tom. Sir, for those who aren't familiar with the tradition, can you tell us about the Renaissance Faire?

Man:
: Yea. But first, bride of Genghis, thou must explainest to me thy very peculiar electronic wand. Oooh!

Stewie:
 All right, Rupert, are you ready to hear our Mad Lib? [Clears throat] "Cinderella had three wicked step-watermelons, who were very smelly to her. So, her fairy god toilet turned her pumpkin into a fanny and sent her off to the poop." [laughing] Oh, my! How ruthlessly absurd!

Lois:
 Peter, how was your big presentation at Chris' class?

Peter:
 It was a huge waste of time.

Lois:
 Well, it couldn't have been that bad.

Peter:
 It was terrible. Everyone else there had some big important job and was way more successful than me.

Brian:
 Hey, come on, you have a great job.

Stewie:
 Yeah...[Stuttering]...you're doing good.

Lois:
 Peter, if you're not satisfied, then be more assertive. Invite Mr. Weed over for dinner and show him what you have to offer the company.

Peter:
 Yeah, I guess I could. I just hope it goes okay. We've had bad luck with dinner guests. Remember when Margot Kidder was here?

Lois:
 We loved you in the Superman movies. You were just wonderful.

Margot Kidder:
 [Screaming]

Peter:
 Mr. Weed, I was wondering if maybe you'd like to come over to my house for dinner Friday night. That wasn't so hard.

 Weed:
 Well, what time?

Peter:
 Uh, I don't know. 7:30, 8:00?

 Weed:
 Fabulous! What shall I bring?

Lois:
 Peter, calm down. Everything's gonna be fine.

Peter:
 I hope so. If I blow this, I'll have to go back to my old job at the Electric Company.

Man:
 D.

Peter:
 Ot.

BOTH:
 Dot.

Man:
 B.

Peter:
 Et.

Man:
 Bet.

Peter:
 Bet. I knew that. Slow it down.

Man:
 P.

Peter:
 It.

Man:
 Pit.

Peter:
 Come on, pal. It's my first day.

Man:
 F.

Peter:
 At.

Man:
 Fat.

Peter:
 Oh, that's it, buddy! [Fighting]

Lois:
 That must be him.

Peter:
 Oh God! I hope that thing doesn't happen where I get nervous and I can't control of the volume of my voice.

 Weed:
 Hello, Peter. How are you?

Peter:
 [Yelling] Fine! [Quietly] Please come in.

Lois:
 It's so nice to have you over, Mr. Weed.

 Weed:
 Thank you, Mrs. Griffin. I understand that you have a beautiful family.

Lois:
 Yes, we do, but the children won't be joining us for dinner. It's almost their bedtime.

Peter:
 [Blows whistle] State your names.

Meg:
 Meg!

Chris:
 Chris!

Stewie:
 And I'm Liesl.

Peter:
 Mr. Weed, the Griffin children would like to say goodnight to you.

 Stewie:
 ? So long, farewell, au revoir, auf wiedersehen ?

Meg:
 ? I'd like to stay and taste my first champagne ? Yes?

Peter:
 No!

 Stewie:
 ? So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, goodbye ?

Chris:
 ? I leave and heave a sigh and say goodbye -- Goodbye! ?

Stewie:
 ? The sun has gone to bed and so must I ?

 Stewie:
 ? So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, goodbye. Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye ?

 Weed:
 ? Goodbye ?

 Weed:
 Mmm! Who would think a woman with such beauty would have the culinary skills of Emeril Lagasse?

Lois:
 Oh, well thank you. Bam! [Laughing] Peter, don't you have something to say to Mr. Weed?

Peter:
 Oh, yeah. Mr. Weed, I don't care what the guys at work say. I never thought you were an effeminate weirdo.

Brian:
 So, what kind of a name is "Weed"?

 Weed:
 They gave it to my grandfather on Ellis Island. Our real name was "Bermudagrass." Peter, being here with your wonderful family, your beautiful home and your funny talking dog, well, I'm impressed. In fact, starting Monday, I would like to promote you to Head of Toy Development.

Peter:
 Holy crap! Ah, thanks, Mr. Weed! You won't be sorry. Brian, quit it. You're embarrassing me here.

Lois:
 Peter, Brian's choking! Do the Heimlich maneuver quick!

 Weed:
 [Choking]

Brian:
 He's dead.

Margot Kidder:
 [Screaming] I forgot my purse.

Peter:
 All right, let's not panic. Nobody even knows about this yet.

Death:
 Police! Random dead-body search!

Peter:
 Oh, my God, Lois! Stall them!

Lois:
 Peter, what are you doing?

Peter:
 Just stall them, Lois!

Death:
 [Laughing] Got ya! It's just me, Death. I'm here for the body.

Lois:
 Peter, it's okay. It's just Death.

s Dog:
 Hey, did someone choke on a roll in here?

Brian:
 Oh, no, no, no. I spit it up.

Tom Tucker:
 Recapping our top story. Doreen, I lost your phone number. We met at the Sky Lounge last night. Please call me. In other news, toy industrialist Jonathan Weed was found dead in the home of an employee who claims Weed choked on a dinner roll. No charges will be filed against the employee but the dinner roll has been taken into custody.

Stewie:
 I'd do her. Do her. Wouldn't do her. Who hasn't done her? Do her. Lose the pigtails and we'll talk. Do her, do her.

Priest:
 And now, the last man to see Jonathan Weed alive has offered to say a few words.

Peter:
 Good afternoon, everyone. As you know, we of the Christian faith believe that Jesus is not really dead but that he must let the world think that he is dead until he can find a way to control the raging spirit that dwells within him. [Peter humming ominous music] Anyway, right before he died, Mr. Weed promoted me to Head of Toy Development, and I've brought along my attorney who confirms that this constitutes a verbal contract. Isn't that right, Saul? [Peter's hand talking] "Yes, sir. Verbal contract." Thank you.

Leonard Hale:
 Glad to see you all found your way over from the cemetery. I'm Leonard Hale, Mr. Weed's lawyer. We found this tape among Mr. Weed's personal effects, with instructions that it be screened immediately after his funeral. Enjoy.

Cameraman:
 Good morning. Camera time.

 Weed:
 Turn it off. I don't have my face on yet. I'm ugly.

Cameraman:
 You want to tell us a little something about what you're making there.

 Weed:
 I will tell you. Just a couple of eggs with the peppers left over from last night. [Snickering] Okay, playtime is over. Turn it off, monkey. Okay?

Leonard Hale:
 [Clearing throat] [Fast-forwarding tape]

 Weed:
 Hello, friends. If you're watching this, I am dead and I bet you're pretty bummed. But I have good news. The Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Factory shall be torn down to make way for the Happy-Go-Lucky Terminal Disease Institute.

 Weed:
 The demolition will begin in...now.

Counselor:
 Okay, we've got your typing test here and all the pertinent data about your...[stuttering]...background and, um, skills, and....

Peter:
 And?

Counselor:
 You, know, I got to be honest with you. I only have another week and a half here and I have completely checked out.

Counselor:
 Yeah.

Peter:
 Well, what should I do?

Counselor:
 [Sighs pensively] Chef?

Peter:
 Oh, sorry, we're out of towels. Let me get that for you, sir. [Blowing]

Man:
 What? I'm supposed to pay $2 for stickers 'cause this guy can't hear? Come on!

Peter:
 Hey, I might be deaf but I have feelings! Oh. I mean...what?

Meg:
 Has Dad found a permanent job yet?

Lois:
 Meg, your father's going through a bit of a career transition. He's just sampling a few things, searching for something that fits him just right. [Gasping]

Brian:
 Clearly it's not that tube top.

Peter:
 Hey! Looking for a good time, sweet cheeks?

Meg:
 Oh, my God!

Lois:
 Peter, get in the car!

Peter:
 Okay, but it will cost you. What do you want? A Cleveland Steamer?

Lois:
 I said get in the car! What's a Cleveland Steamer?

Brian:
 It means that he'll...

Peter:
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Be cool, be cool. Yes, you go to Maple Street, and then take a left, and then you go.... Okay, so you want to party or what?

Lois:
 Get in this car right now!

Stewie:
 It's eerie, isn't it? Like looking into the future.

Gene Rayburn:
 Forgetful Freddy was so forgetful...

All:
 How forgetful was he?

Gene Rayburn:
 He was so forgetful, whenever he tried to remember someone's name he drew a "blank."

Lois:
 Oh, God! This is all my fault. If I hadn't pushed you so hard to invite Mr. Weed to dinner he'd still be alive and you'd still have your job.

Peter:
 Don't worry, Lois. We'll get through this. We just have to scrimp a little, that's all. You know, sell some stuff we don't really need. This'll bring in a couple of bucks.

Lois:
 Peter, please, listen to me. When we got married, you always talked about your one dream job. Remember? And you put that dream aside in order to provide for this family.

Peter:
 Yeah?

Lois:
 Well, I've saved some money from teaching piano, and I say this is the perfect time for you to pursue that dream.

Lois:
 Yes!

Peter:
 You know, since money's getting tight, I was gonna suggest that we eat the kids. You know, jokingly at first, but then I was gonna gauge your reaction and if you were cool with it, we would go from there, but this is a much better idea. I'm going to do it, Lois. I'm going to realize my dream! I am going to be a Renaissance Faire jouster!

Lois:
 Oh, this is so exciting! My little jouster's first day. Here's your lunch.

Peter:
 Thanks, honey. Oh, egg salad?

Lois:
 Have a good time.

Peter:
 I'll try. Hey, Mort.

Mort:
 Oh, God! Don't hurt me! Oh, hi, Peter.

Peter:
 Hey, you gonna be a jouster, too?

Mort:
 Yes. I'm trying to overcome my fear of swords 'cause a man in a pirate suit stabbed me in the ear when I was 5, and then again when I was 30. What about you? Same?

Peter:
 Not really. It kinda all goes back to when I was 18. I was going through that rebellious phase, and hanging out with a bad crowd.

Girl:
 Here, Peter. Try one of these.

Peter:
 What is it?

Girl:
 It's a cheeseburger.

Peter:
 Of course, now I know it wasn't a cheeseburger but at that time, I was ready to believe anything. I didn't know what the hell was going on. I wandered around for hours and somehow ended up at the Renaissance Faire. [in flashback] I can fly!

Black Knight:
 Oh, my God!

Peter:
 [Screaming] I was saved by the one and only Black Knight of the Quahog Renaissance Faire.

Black Knight:
 A word of advice-the path to knighthood is paved with strength and nobility, not LSD and sideburns.

Peter:
 And from that moment on, I knew someday I wanted to be a knight like him.

Mort:
 Oh, mercy! I was once addicted to antihistamines. I took so many I thought I was Mr. Peanut.

Peter:
 Ah, that's a great story, too.

Coach:
 You all think you got what it takes to be jousters! If you're gonna joust, you got to want it! Let me hear your war cry!

Mort:
 [Feeble cry]

Coach:
 Is that the best you got, you pile of crap?

Mort:
 Yes. From an early age, my parents discouraged loud noises!

Coach:
 You know what you are? You're a candy-ass maggot! You find something funny, maggot?

Man:
 Sir, no, sir!

Coach:
 You love the Middle Ages, don't you?

Man:
 Sir, yes, sir!

Coach:
 The concept of a geocentric universe gets you sexually excited, doesn't it?

Coach:
 You want to make 16th century mathematician Johannes Kepler your bitch, don't you?

Black Knight:
 Welcome, apprentices.

Peter:
 It's him.

Coach:
 Look alive, ladies. Allow me to introduce the best of the best the Black Knight himself! And this is his trophy wench, Maid Madeleine!

Mort:
 Ding.

Peter:
 Excuse me, Mr. Black Knight?

Black Knight:
 I'm busy.

Peter:
 Oh, well, I just wanted to thank you. I don't know if you remember, but when I was a kid you helped me get my life back on the right path.

Black Knight:
 Damn it. Look, I'm busy, all right?

Peter:
 Okay. I'll come back later.

Black Knight:
 Damn rookies.

Mort:
 Are all the other men out of the shower yet?

Stewie:
 [to Meg] Hey, you, porker. Yes, I'm calling you a porker and there's nothing you can do about it because I'm protected by my impenetrable cereal-box fort. [Laughing] [to Brian] Hey, you, drunkie. Yes, that's right, I'm calling you drunkie and there's nothing you can do about it because I'm...

Lois:
 The toast is ready.

Peter:
 I'll get it, Lois. There you go.

Lois:
 Peter, maybe you shouldn't bring your lance to the table.

Peter:
 Lois, if I'm gonna get good enough to impress the Black Knight, my lance must be with me at all times. You guys are gonna be so proud when you see me out on that field. Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta go practice.

Meg:
 [Screams] Oh, my God, Dad! My earring! Dad, stop!

Peter:
 Yeah, two mutton joints, please.

Man:
 Thou wishes to feast on the appendage of a humble ovine.

Peter:
 Listen, you freak. We don't all watch Frasier, okay? Now, give me two mutton joints.

Mort:
 Thank you.

Madeleine:
 'Tis a glorious afternoon. Wouldst thou not agree?

Peter:
 Yea, kind shrew. I before thee except after C.

Madeleine:
 Wouldst thou take a gander underneath my frock?

Peter:
 [Stuttering] Sure, whatever floats your boat. There you go. Jeez, frickin' perverts.

Black Knight:
 Madeleine, go wait in the Hyundai! What were you doing with my girl?

Peter:
 Jeez, she walks over here and asks me to put a bird in her panties! I'm here going, "What the hell?"

Mort:
 God! Peter, play dead! Curl up in an ass ball or something!

Peter:
 What's the problem, BK?

Black Knight:
 I don't like you, I don't like your face, and I don't like you hanging around my girl! I don't ever want to see you here again!

Peter:
 Oh. So, okay, we can see each other outside the Faire, right? I'm just trying to understand the rules.

Black Knight:
 If I see you again, I'll kill you.

Peter:
 Okay, that's much clearer.

Mort:
 Oh, God! I think I just miscarried!

Lois:
 Peter, what are you doing? I spent hours soldering that costume for you.

Peter:
 I don't need it anymore, Lois. I quit the team.

Lois:
 Quit the team? But you can't quit jousting. The big meet is today, and I thought you were...

Peter:
 Did you just say "big meet"?

Lois:
 Oh, my God! I did.

Lois:
 We almost missed that one.

Peter:
 I know. That was a close one.

Lois:
 But I'm being serious here, Peter. We were all set to come see you joust today. You were so excited to be on the same field as the Black Knight.

Peter:
 I'm gonna be watching it from the stands, Lois, because the Black Knight is just a big jerk! Just like that guy who fixed our vacuum.

Repairman:
 There you go. All fixed. Turns out a half-eaten meatball was clogging up the intake.

Repairman:
 No.

Diane Simmons:
 Well, it's an exciting day here for all at the Renaissance Faire jousting meet. Wouldn't you say, Tom?

Tom Tucker:
 Diane, I'd say it was perfect day if you weren't reminding us all of our grandmas' cleavage. Now, let's go live to the field where Black Knight is preparing to challenge his next opponent.

Monks:
 [Chanting "Rock and Roll, Part 2"]

Stewie:
 Hey. How're you doing there, big guy? You holding up all right? You want a soda? Hmm? Screw it. I tried.

Man:
 The Black Knight's next challenger will be Sir Mort Goldman.

Mort:
 [Grunting] Oh, God! I forfeit!

Tom Tucker:
 That's it, folks. It looks like the Black Knight is out of challengers and is once again undefeated.

Black Knight:
 Hey, what's your fat ass doing here?

Man:
 He's my only means of conveyance. But I guess I do spoil him.

Black Knight:
 Clearly you do. And what are you doing here, Griffin? I thought I told you never to show your face here again!

Peter:
 We're just watching, all right? I don't want any trouble.

Black Knight:
 You've got trouble if you don't beat it.

Peter:
 Listen, buddy...

Black Knight:
 I said get lost!

Meg:
 Where's he going?

Chris:
 Dad!

Lois:
 Let him go, kids.

Black Knight:
 You see that, kids? Your father is nothing but a fizzle!

Peter:
 Nobody calls me a fizzle and gets away with it!

Peter:
 Except that one guy who called me a fizzle and then ran off. He got away with it. But most people who call me a fizzle don't get away with it. Well, actually, that guy who got away with it was the only one who ever called me a fizzle. After today only half the people who ever called me a fizzle will have gotten away with it.

Tom Tucker:
 It appears a new challenger has entered the field. The crowd has fallen deathly ill-silent. Sorry.

Peter:
 Oh, my God! I'm gonna die!

Tom Tucker:
 To the owner of a yellow Hyundai, your car is being towed.

Black Knight:
 What?

Peter:
 I won!

Lois:
 Oh, Peter, that was amazing. You were so brave.

Chris:
 Nice going, Dad.

Peter:
 Boy! That was lucky about the car, huh?

Mort:
 Take that, you bastard! Nobody makes a fool out of Mort Goldman!

Coach:
 Spectacular performance, maggot! How would you like to come on the road with us as our lead jouster?

Peter:
 Thanks, but no thanks, Coach. I've lived my dream. And besides, my life is here with my family.

Chris:
 But what's Dad gonna do for a job?

Lois:
 It'll be okay, Chris. Remember that episode of The Honeymooners when Ralph lost his job but at the end of the show he didn't get it bac?

Peter:
 What was up with that? That bugged the crap out of me.

Stewie:
 Oh, let's see. We got soda, purple stuff. Oh, Sunny D! All right!

Announcer:
 We now return to The Smurfs.

Lois:
 Hello? Oh, my God! Peter, why are you staring into the dryer?

Peter:
 I'm watching the latest episode of Laundry Theater. See? Now, those are Chris' socks, right? They don't know that Stewie's shirt is having an affair with Meg's trousers. Ooh, it's fun to watch rich people be naughty!

Lois:
 Peter, listen to me. My sister just called. Her baby's due any day now and Ted just walked out on her.

Peter:
 Whoa, whoa. Back it up, back it up. You have a sister?

Lois:
 I promised her I'd be on the next train. Poor Carol. All alone in that big house.

Peter:
 Wait a minute. Carol. Carol. Is she the one with the Jacuzzi and the pool table?

Peter:
 Better come with you.

Lois:
 Really? Well, that's a surprise.

Peter:
 Oh, come on, Lois. When have I not been there for you?

Peter:
 Thanks for the ride, lady!

Quagmire:
 Hey, it's the Griffins! What can I do for you?

Lois:
 Glen, we have a family emergency. We need you to take the kids for just a couple days.

Quagmire:
 Well, in accordance with Megan's law, I'm obligated to inform you that...you know what, that's fine. I'll take the kids.

Peter:
 Aw, thanks, buddy.

Quagmire:
 Gosh! I've never had to entertain kids before. So a chick walks into a gynecologist's office...[Makes ridiculous noises] [Makes baby noises]

Lois:
 Don't worry. We'll get you through this. In a few days you'll have a beautiful baby. And you can smother it with all your unrequited love.

Carol:
 As soon as the baby can crawl, it'll probably leave me, too just like my eight husbands.

Peter:
 Hey, Carol. It's me, Ted. Listen, I came back because I love you. I'm just kidding. It's me, Peter.

Carol:
 It was so nice of you to come, Peter. You're so considerate.

Peter:
 It was nothing.

Chris:
 Mr. Quagmire! I finished the scavenger hunt!

Quagmire:
 Whoa, whoa, hold your horses, hold your horses. Let's go down the list. An unsharpened pencil?

Chris:
 Check!

Quagmire:
 A speed-limit sign that doesn't end in 5 or 0?

Quagmire:
 Your mom's hairbrush?

Quagmire:
 You win!

Chris:
 Boy! What's my prize?

Quagmire:
 A pencil and a speed sign!

Chris:
 I did it!

Quagmire:
 I'll be right back. A couple of teeth and toenail clippings and we'll be ready for our date!

Peter:
 Hey, Carol? Since Ted dumped you, can I have his shirts?

Lois:
 Peter, what are you gonna do with Ted's shirts? He's half your size.

Peter:
 I know, I know, I know. But check this out. Hey, Carol. Say, "David Banner, I just slashed your tires."

Carol:
 "David Banner, I just slashed your tires."

Peter:
 [Angry screaming] I'm priceless.

Lois:
 Peter, sit with Carol. I'm gonna use the ladies' room.

Carol:
 Does she still take the newspaper in there?

Peter:
 Yeah. And after she does, I just can't read it.

Carol:
 [Screaming] Oh! Oh, God! The baby's gonna be here any minute! We had better get moving!

Peter:
 Carol, you got to relax. You let that kid start calling the shots now and you're screwed.

Chris:
 Is Mr. Quagmire babysitting all these people, too?

Quagmire:
 Hey, if I could rearrange the alphabet, I'd put "U" and "l" together. You must be a parking ticket because you got "fine" written all over you. Hey there. I don't want to come between you. Or do I? Oh, that's awful. That's awful.

Stewie:
 This is a song I've been singing for a number of years. I find it grows truer and truer as time goes by. [plays "Hungry Eyes" by Eric Carmen] ? Hungry eyes ? ? I feel the magic between you and I ? Ooh, I'm hungry for you, baby. Come on. Walk with me. Talk with me. [Smacks woman's butt]

Carol:
 [Panting]

Lois:
 Don't worry, Carol. We're almost there. Peter, why are we stopped?

Peter:
 Um, yeah, I'll have three cheeseburgers.

Lois:
 For God's sake! She's having a baby!

Peter:
 That's right. And a kid's meal. And I guess I'll have fries. If I have fries, is anybody else gonna have any? Because I don't want to be the only one eating them; I'll feel like a fatty.

Lois:
 Nurse! This woman is in labor!

Mayor West:
 Excuse me. I was here first. My leg is asleep.

Doctor:
 All right, let's see what we have here. Oh, the baby's crowning.

Carol:
 [Yelling]

Doctor:
 I'm just going to put on a pair of gloves and we'll deliver this baby. These don't feel like gloves at all. They feel like used needles. But this is where I always keep the gloves. Maybe if I dig deeper. Nope. Just feels like more needles. That's the craziest thing. Oh, now I'm sure this isn't the glove drawer.

Carol:
 My God! Who's gonna deliver my baby?

Lois:
 Honey, do something!

Peter:
 No baby. But it looks like Carol's blowing a bubble.

Lois:
 Peter, that's the head! Push! Push!

Peter:
 I am! It won't go back in!

Lois:
 Not you, Peter! Carol, push! Peter, you pull!

Peter:
 Oh, my God!

Lois:
 What? What?

Peter:
 It's a beautiful baby girl.

Carol:
 A baby girl. I'm so happy.

Peter:
 But she has a penis. Well, we'll have to do something about that.

Lois:
 Peter, no! It's a boy!

Peter:
 Well, how do you like that? Hey there, little fella. Welcome to the planet Earth. Kitchy kitchy kitchy koo. [Baby passes gas] He takes after his Uncle Peter.

Lois:
 Peter, he's Carol's baby. Give him to her.

Lois:
 Honey, you were fantastic. And you were so cute when you were holding it.

Peter:
 I know. I didn't want to give it up.

Lois:
 Yeah?

Peter:
 Let's steal it.

Peter:
 No, wait. I got a better idea. Lois, let's have another baby.

Lois:
 What? Sweetie, you're not serious?

Peter:
 I sure am. The best thing I've ever done with my life is being a dad.

Lois:
 Oh, Peter. I think it's a wonderful idea.

Doctor:
 Why haven't you sent for help?

Meg:
 I can't believe you guys want to have another kid!

Lois:
 Peter, did you find Chris and Meg's baby books?

Peter:
 Not yet. Hey, look at this, Lois. It's our pet rock. I remember the first day we brought it home. [flashback] See that? Bad rock. Bad. We do that outside! Look at him. He knows what he did.

Chris:
 I found my baby book! Here's the broken condom that led to my birth.

Lois:
 And the resulting lawsuit bought us this house. You're my favorite mistake.

Chris:
 You see, Meg? I'm the favorite!

Stewie:
 Ah, baby books. Nostalgic for the days of chafed nipples and episiotomies?

Lois:
 Somebody hasn't heard the news.

Stewie:
 News? What news?

Lois:
 What's the most wonderful thing that could happen to this family?

Stewie:
 The Phillies won.

Peter:
 You're gonna have a baby brother, buddy.

Lois:
 Or sister.

Stewie:
 A new baby. That's wonderful. Call me when Kojak starts. What?

Stewie:
Another baby? But I'm the baby. Why the deuce would they want to replace me? My cheeks are pinchable. My bottom is smooth. My laugh is heartwarming. [laughs] What's that? I certainly am not overreacting! What the devil do you think happened to Bobby when they added Cousin Oliver to The Brady Bunch?

 Brady:
 Oliver, did you break this vase?

Oliver:
 No. The floor did.

Peter:
 He's so cute.

Bobby:
 Hey, everybody. I...

 Brady:
 Bobby, you get back in the garage!

Stewie:
 It can't happen! I was here first! well, technically, third but no time for semantics. This is Stewie Country and I intend to keep it that way! As God is my witness, from this day forward Peter and Lois shall not conceive!

Stewie:
 What are you doing here?

Brian:
 Uh, Peter and Lois are, uh, getting intimate.

Stewie:
 My God! I thought I had more time! I've got to stop them!

Stewie:
 [Fake crying] Mommy! Daddy! I had a bad dream! I saw the.... Blast! What the devil is that name again? Bogeyman! Yes. That's it. I saw the bogeyman.

Lois:
 Aw, did someone have a bad dream? Why don't you sleep with Mommy and Daddy? Peter, for God's sakes! Stewie's right here!

Peter:
 Come on, Lois, we can still do it. He'll just think I'm hurting you.

Lois:
 Relax, honey. It's only for tonight.

Stewie:
 Roll over. Roll over, I say! [Muffled yelping] Smells like cheese.

Brian:
 Okay. "Insert Rod Support A into Slot B."

Peter:
 That's what...

Brian:
 And if you say "That's what she said" one more time, I'm gonna pop you.

Joe:
 What you building there, neighbor?

Peter:
 Well, we were keeping it a secret, but you guys are my best friends, so I'll tell you. Lois and I are having another baby!

Guys:
 [Girlish shrieking]

Quagmire:
 We are so throwing you a shower!

Stewie:
 Well, fat man, we'll see if Lois wants to have sexual relations when she finds lipstick on your collar. There we are. Well! Look at you there. You're a filthy girl, aren't you? Yes, you're looking for a bad time. That's what you're after. You're a dirty flirt. You want it bad. You don't care where you get it from. You have no self-respect, and that gets you off, doesn't it?

Lois:
 Stewie! Bad boy! That's Mommy's makeup! You got it all over your father's favorite shirt. Now, go to your room!

Brian:
 Wow. The evidence is really piling up.

Stewie:
 Make any joke you want. You know I look good.

Stewie:
 My God! They're at it again! All this time spent keeping people from having sex! Now I know how the Catholic Church feels. Ba-zing! Time to initiate Phase Two.

Stewie:
 All right. Testing voice modulator. "Blast you, vile woman!"

Peter robot:
 Blast you, vile woman!

Stewie:
 Oh, that won't do. "Pardon me, you with the severe aesthetic deficiencies."

Peter:
 Hey, ugly.

Stewie:
 Excellent! [Maniacal laughter]

Peter:
 Sweet.

Peter:
 Who's got beer?

Lois:
 Where'd you go, my little pumpkin eater?

Peter robot:
 To the can, because kissing you made me barf.

Chris:
 Dad, Meg keeps pushing me!

Meg:
 Oh, like I could! He's so fat!

Chris:
 I'm not fat! I'm Rubenesque!

Peter robot:
 That's it. Your dad's had enough. I want you kids to go downstairs and drink the antifreeze in the garage.

Chris:
 I'm gonna chug it all so there's none left for you!

Meg:
 Hey, watch it!

Cleveland:
 Hey, Peter. I see nothing. Nothing.

Lois:
 I've had it with these interruptions! All we want is a little time alone! Go to your rooms for the rest of the night.

Chris:
 I don't want to go to my room. There's an evil monkey in my closet!

Peter:
 "Evil monkey." Right.

Lois:
 This romantic dinner was a wonderful idea, Peter.

Peter:
 Ah, you deserve it, my beautiful princess.

Lois:
 [laughing] You know, I'm not wearing any panties.

Peter:
 Don't worry. We can always throw that chair out.

Stewie:
 Very well then. If I can't stop them from the outside I'll stop them from the inside! Oh, dear! I'm afraid you're in a no-fly zone. As was your fate, Mr. Fly, so is the fate of every sperm in Peter's body!

Stewie:
 Computer on.

Computer:
 30 minutes to re-expansion.

Stewie:
 Just enough time to obliterate all those little potential usurpers. Engine status?

Computer:
 Nominal.

Stewie:
 Fuel supply?

Computer:
 Full.

Stewie:
 Air Supply?

Stewie:
 Very well. Through the lips, over the gums. Look out testicles, here I come!

Peter:
 ? Lois ? ? You can't spell love without L-O ? ? You can't spell is without I-S ? ? You can't spell silo without Lois ? And solo from the pet rock! Oh no no no, oh, oh god, oh god.

Computer:
 Warning. Host's oxygen levels rising. Heart rate increasing.

Stewie:
 Oh, my God! Either they're watching Batman or they're "doing the Dew"!

Stewie:
 If I'm to reach the testicles and destroy the sperm before coitus, I must buy some time.. Computer, location?

Computer:
 Fifteen millimeters northeast of the duodenum.

Stewie:
 Very well. Fire phasers!

Peter:
 Oh, jeez, my duodenum's acting up!

Computer:
 Entering testicular perimeter.

Stewie:
 Do you know what today is? A bad day to be a sperm.

Stewie:
 What the deuce? Well, it seems you are out of ammunition.

Bertram:
 As are you, Stewart!

Stewie:
 You know my name!

Bertram:
 I know many things.

Stewie:
 Indeed?

Bertram:
 Quite.

Stewie:
 Yes.

Bertram:
 Mmm.

Stewie:
 well, perhaps we should exchange monosyllabic expressions of arrogance in person.

Bertram:
 Mmmm.

Stewie:
 Mmmm.

Bertram:
 Yes.

Lois:
 Peter, I'm waiting.

Peter:
 I'm coming.

Stewie:
 You came unarmed?

Bertram:
 As we agreed.

Stewie:
 Admirable. But foolish! It's going to be a shame to destroy such a worthy adversary.

Bertram:
 My thoughts exactly.

Stewie:
 I've got you in the sleeper hold!

Bertram:
 As I you.

Stewie:
 Your attempts to escape are futile. Well, well. Naptime appears to be over.

Bertram:
 Go ahead! Finish me off! My one regret is that I won't be able to do away with that red-headed woman.

Stewie:
 What the.... How the devil do you know about Lois?

Bertram:
 You've seen that little gleam in the fat man's eye? That twinkle? That's me plotting my escape.

Stewie:
 You hate Lois? I hate Lois, too. What else do you hate?

Bertram:
 People who send pictures of their families as Christmas cards!

Stewie:
 Ooh, ooh, people who use the word "guesstimate."

Bertram:
 Guys who wear sandals with socks!

Both:
 Jason Patric! Ooo!

Stewie:
 You know, perhaps I've been looking at this the wrong way. I daresay I should embrace the idea of having a little brother. After all, it's obvious we'd make quite a formidable team.

Computer:
 [beeping] Two minutes to re-expansion.

Stewie:
 Dear God! I'll never get out in time!

Bertram:
 Move aside! I know a shortcut!

Lois:
 [Moaning]

Peter:
 [Moaning]

Lois:
 [Choking]

Computer:
 Re-expansion in 60 seconds.

Bertram:
 There's the tear duct. We've got to make him cry.

Stewie:
 I think I know just the way. All right. Follow my lead.

Stewie:
 ? Love lift us up where we belong ? ? Where the eagles fly, on a mountain high ?

Both:
 ? Love lift us up where we belong ?

Lois:
 Peter, I love you.

Peter:
 And I love you, Lou Gossett, Jr.

Stewie:
 It worked! Hurry, get down there so you can be born!

Computer:
 Ten seconds to re-expansion.

Bertram:
 I guess this is good-bye.

Stewie:
 For now. Oh, when you're born, don't let the doctor slap you on the ass. It degrades us all.

Stewie:
 Give it to her good, old man!

Lois:
 Peter, wait. I've been thinking. It's been a long time since we had such a wonderful night. And it's gonna be impossible to spend time together like this if we're raising another child.

Peter:
 Well, I thought, you know, Brian would kind of do a lot of the work.

Lois:
 I don't know. I mean, Stewie alone needs so much attention. Maybe we should hold off on having another baby.

Peter:
 You may be right.

Stewie:
 No! No, no! You must receive his seed!

Lois:
 Look who's here.

Peter:
 But, Lois, we still get to do it, right?

Lois:
 Honey, not in front of Stewie.

Peter:
 Okay. Back in a minute.

Stewie:
 No! Come back here this instant, you fat bastard and do her! Stop it. Stop tickling me. I'll kill you. I swear to God. What did you just do?

Peter:
 [Sighing]

Stewie:
 No! You killed my brother! How could you, you...oh, my God! The twinkle. He's alive. Well played, sperm brother. He's more clever than I thought. Perhaps too clever.

Lois:
 Peter, this is ridiculous. I know you're upset about losing your job, but you've been sitting on that couch for two weeks.

Peter:
 I have not, Lois.

Brian:
 He's right. It's actually been more like...yeah, 13 days.

Lois:
 Well you at least have do something other than sitting there eating.

Peter:
 All right, all right. Brian, let's go for a walk.

Meg:
 [Sobbing]

Lois:
 Meg, sweetheart, what's wrong?

Meg:
 My life. That's what's wrong. I was totally humiliated at school today.

Principal Shepherd:
 Okay, we're gonna do a little informal survey here, kids. Would those of you going away for spring break please move to the left of the room? [Repeats request in Spanish]

Lois:
 Oh, Meg, what do those kids know?

Meg:
 They know how to have a good time.

Lois:
 Well, so do we. I'll tell you what. How about you and I have our own little spring break? We'll go to that fancy new spa that just opened up in Warwick. Massages and facials. Ah! It'll be great. What do you say?

Meg:
 I guess it couldn't be worse than last year when we all went to Sea World.

Lois:
 [Laughing]

Peter:
 And how long has this been going on?

Peter:
 Lois is right. I've been out of work too long.

Brian:
 I think you should find something you really enjoy doing. Take those guys out there, for example.

Peter:
 Where? Oh, yeah. Now, that's a job. Fresh sea air, working outside. That's how a real New England man makes a living.

Brian:
 Well, maybe that's something to think about, Peter.

Jake Tucker:
 What's that, Daddy?

Tom Tucker:
 That's Mercury, Jake. The planet closest to the sun. What it's doing down here by the wharf, I haven't the foggiest. We should probably ask a scientist...

Peter:
 I'm a guy, you jackass!

Peter:
 Yeah, that feels good.

Lois:
 Chris, don't forget to mist under his chins.

Stewie:
 Oh, boy, Lois! It's a real mess down there. I'm afraid I not going to be able to do this in the time I quoted you earlier.

Peter:
 Chris, shut the hose off for a second. Everybody, I have an announcement. I am gonna drop this weight and rejoin the workforce. I have decided to become a professional fisherman.

Lois:
 What? Why a fisherman?

Peter:
 It makes perfect sense, Lois. You know how much time I've spent on the ocean.

Peter:
 Wilson! What are we gonna do now? Wilson! Wilson!

Voit:
 My name is Voit, dumb ass.

Stewie:
 Hello, Doreen? Yeah, I'm still over at the Griffin job. Listen, tell Walter I'm not going to be able to make it to the construction site. I don't know. Have him send Frank, or Glen, or Harelip Steve. I know, it creeps me out, too.

Peter:
 So you think I can find a boat here, huh, Joe?

Joe:
 Yeah. You wouldn't believe what we confiscate from these crooks.

Auctioneer:
 Welcome. We open today's bidding with this pair of panties confiscated from a prostitute.

Quagmire:
 $50!

Auctioneer:
 She had nine STDs.

Quagmire:
 $45.

Auctioneer:
 And when we caught her, she wet herself.

Quagmire:
 $50.

Cleveland:
 Excuse me. Are you gonna sell anything that's not gross?

Auctioneer:
 And now our next item. Please direct your attention to this photo of a beautiful 40-foot fishing boat.

Peter:
 Oh, man! That's perfect!

Man:
 $12,000!

Peter:
 $13,000!

Peter:
 [Whimpering]

Auctioneer:
 Sold for $25,000!

Auctioneer:
 And now the actual boat itself. Do I have an opening bid for the boat?

Peter:
 $50,000!

Auctioneer:
 Sold for $50,000!

Joe:
 Good for you, Peter.

Shamus:
 Congratulations. You've just bought yourself a cursed boat.

Peter:
 Cursed?

Shamus:
 The last captain of that vessel lost his life. And it weren't no accident! His name was Salty. And he was devoured by Daggermouth, the man-eating blowfish. You want to buy that boat? Go ahead. But don't expect me to fish your dead body from an angry sea that gave you fair warning.

Peter:
 Are you up for bids, too? You are just precious.

Lois:
 All right, I left you the number for the spa. See you in a few days.

Meg:
 Not if I strangle myself with a seaweed wrap and die.

Peter:
 You are dark!

Brian:
 Peter, you haven't told me how you expect to pay for that boat.

Peter:
 Don't worry, Brian. There's got to be 100 banks that'll give me a loan.

Peter:
 Wow! So, you can really give me a loan?

Jim Kaplan:
 I sure can. You see, Mr. Griffin, what sets us apart from other banks is that other banks are banks. Now, I trust you have collateral.

Peter:
 Um, I got three kids.

Jim Kaplan:
 I'll take them. Just kidding. Or maybe I'm not. Sign this. Here you go. Good luck!

Jim Kaplan:
 So, what do you want on your thigh?

Biker:
 I want a skull.

Jim Kaplan:
 Okay. Well, I can draw Kermit the Frog. How about a nice Kermit the Frog?

Biker:
 No. I want a skull.

Jim Kaplan:
 Okay, well, I'm gonna go ahead and do Kermit the Frog.

Meg:
 Mom, this is so lame.

Lois:
 Come on, Meg. Try to have fun. I promise after a few days here you won't even remember the words "spring break". How about some TV?

MTV VJ:
 This is MTV and we're rocking at spring break!

 VJ:
 This is VH1 and we're rocking at spring break.

Bernard Shaw:
 ...leaving thousands injured. For CNN, I'm Bernard Shaw...keeping it real and kicking ass at spring break! Whoo!

Meg:
 [sighing]

Peter:
 There she is, boys. The S.S. More Powerful than Superman, Batman, Spiderman, and the Incredible Hulk Put Together.

Hennessey:
 Yes, she's a fine vessel. Welcome to the wharf. Name's Hennessey.

Peter:
 Hi there. Peter Griffin. My friends call me Peter for short.

Hennessey:
 I'll let you in on a little secret, neighbor. The best fishing is at latitude 42, longitude 71. Keep that to yourself.

Peter:
 Oh, wow! Thanks. I'll see you, fellows. I got some fish to catch. Let's see. Latitude 42, longitude 71. This is it. What the hell?

Boy:
 Papa, he killed Mordecai the Dancing Yiddish Clown!

Father:
 Stop crying! You just became a man. Now, act like one!

Peter:
 Hey, Hennessey, what's the big idea sending me to that Bar Mitzvah?

Hennessey:
 Because I don't like you! And I don't like your face! We don't need any more fishermen crowding up this wharf!

Peter:
 Oh, well, fine, Hennessey! You want an enemy, you got one!

Hennessey:
 Fine!

Stewie:
 There we are. Hey, Steve, you ever think of growing a moustache?

Hennessey:
 Nice fish you got there, Griffin. What are you selling? Your bait?

Peter:
 Nice face, Hennessey. Yes! Me, one. You, zero. Hey!

Man:
 Wow! How do you do it?

Peter:
 You're very nice to ask. First I hang the old worm out there. They usually go for it. So, I jerk them around a little. They fight for a while. And then they just lay back and accept it.

Man:
 How about we get together later?

Peter:
 Um, okay. What the hell? Oh, damn it! Hey! What's going on here?

Peter:
 If by "read" you mean "imagined a naked lady," then yes.

Brian:
 Peter, listen, the bank's taking all our stuff. And according to this if you don't pay them within 48 hours, they get the house, too.

Chris:
 Oh, boy! I get to go live at the bank!

Lois:
 Meg, Did I ever tell you that if you're on birth control and you take an antibiotic it makes it not work? Because no one told me. I thought you should know.

Meg:
 Look, Mom, I don't really feel like talking right now. Okay?

Lois:
 Fine. I just don't understand why we had to leave the spa so early.

Meg:
 Look, I just want to go home and spend the next three days in solitary confinement where I belong!

Lois:
 [sighing] Well, I tried.

Meg:
 Mom, what the hell are we doing here?

Lois:
 This is where you wanted to be. Right, honey?

Meg:
 Yeah. But not with you!

Spring Breaker:
 Hey, did you hear what happened to the dude from UMass? He got so drunk he fell off his hotel balcony! He's in a coma!

Spring Breaker:
 You know it! Yeah!

Spring Breakers:
 [Intense hollering]

Connie:
 Hey, look. Meg made it, you guys.

Cool girl:
 Yeah. And she brought her mommy.

Lois:
 Come on, Meg! Get out of the car! Like the kids say, up your nose with a rubber hose!

Spring Breaker:
 Hey, look, everybody. It's Spuds MacKenzie! [Screaming]

Brian:
 That's the last of the furniture.

Peter:
 No TV. I miss my friends. John Ritter, and Florence Henderson, and Alfonso Ribeiro.

Brian:
 Is he the guy from Silver Spoons?

Peter:
 Um, no, well, he was on French Prince of Bel-Air....

Brian:
 Fresh Prince.

Peter:
 Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. But I don't know if he was also on... Hey, Alfonso.

Alfonso Ribeiro:
 Yeah?

Peter:
 Were you on Silver Spoons?

Alfonso Ribeiro:
 Yes, I was.

Peter:
 Oh, there you go.

Lois:
 Come on. Just a little higher, honey.

Meg:
 Mom, I don't think I can...

Spring Breaker:
 Hey, who's holding Lois?

Carson Daly:
 This is Carson Daly. And we're live here at spring break. Who wants to party? Okay, one, two, three, four, five.... Okay, we're gonna need cake and juice for 14 people. All right, now let's go to Tom Green who's gonna do something really outrageous!

Tom Green:
 Does anyone out there like me yet? Can I stop this?

Peter:
 Hey, what the hell are you doing in my house?

Jim:
 Your house? This is my house. My wife and I bought it from the bank.

Peter:
 I still got another day to pay back the loan.

Jim:
 The bank said it wouldn't matter because you're a fat deadbeat loser.

Peter:
 Fat deadbeat loser? Well, sir, while I may not agree with what you say, I'll defend to the death your right to say it.

Abby:
 There we are. It's a van Gogh print. Isn't it beautiful?

Stewie:
 Oh, yes, I've often fantasized about what this house would be like with more culture.

Stewie:
 The port is quite good.

Brian:
 Quite good.

Chris:
 Indeed.

Peter:
 Most certainly.

Brian:
 What year is it?

Chris:
 '51.

Peter:
 Ah.

Stewie:
 Delectable.

Brian:
 Indeed.

Chris:
 Yes.

Peter:
 Oh, dear!

Peter:
 I've spontaneously combusted.

Stewie:
 well, I am Sorry.

Peter:
 Oh, it's quite all right. I'm tired of living.

Stewie:
 Ah, very good then.

Chris:
 For the best.

Brian:
 Yes, indeed.

Stewie:
 Is it raining again?

Rabbi:
 Did you hear the one about us?

Connie:
 Wow! You are such a good dancer.

Cool girl:
 Way to go on that beer bong.

Cool guy:
 Yeah, no fake. No fake.

Lois:
 Hey! What are you doing here?

Meg:
 What am I doing here? I've been waiting out here for hours!

Meg:
 You were supposed to pop inside "real quick" and find someone who looked enough like me so I could use their ID. And then you were supposed to come out and give me the ID so I could get inside.

Meg:
 God, it's like talking to a 3-year-old!

Lois:
 Oh, you know what? You need to learn how to loosen up a little, toots.

Meg:
 Yeah, I get the feeling you're loose enough for us both.

Meg:
 Nothing.

Lois:
 That's right nothing. Don't you sass me!

Chris:
 Good evening. Stevenson residence.

Meg:
 Chris, honey, we've been over this a thousand times. It's pronounced "Griffin."

Chris:
 Hi, Mom!

Lois:
 Hi, Chris. Put your father on.

Chris:
 Hey, Dad?

Jim:
 And the French guy says, "Deodorant? What's that?"

Stewie:
 All right. All right. I've got one. I've got one. Okay. Two men are standing at the Pearly Gates. Oh, God, wait! How did that one go? Oh, well, anyway, it turns out they're Siegfried and Roy. I'm no good at telling jokes.

Chris:
 Dad, it's Mom.

Peter:
 Oh, God! Please be Somerset Maugham. Please be Somerset Maugham. Hello?

Lois:
 Peter?

Peter:
 Damn!

Lois:
 I was just calling to check in with my boys, see how you guys are doing.

Peter:
 We're fine.

Lois:
 What's all the noise?

Peter:
 Nothing. Nothing. [plays tape recording of Lois speaking] "Peter, I need you to take out the trash!" Okay, Lois! Lois, I got to go! Holy crap, Brian! What am I gonna do? Lois is gonna be home in a couple of days and we're getting kicked out of the house tomorrow.

Brian:
 What do you suggest?

Peter:
 Get out your ring.

Brian:
 Peter, that's not gonna...

Both:
 Wonder Twin powers, activate!

Peter:
 Form of steam!

Brian:
 Peter, we got these in a box of Franken Berry.

Jim:
 A jackal! Jackal! It's a jackal! It looks like a jackal! Jackal? Jackal? It's a jackal! Jackal?

Abby:
 Time!

Stewie:
 It wasn't right the first time you said it! Why the hell would it be right the next 10 times? God!

Peter:
 Oh, man, I am screwed! I'm gonna lose my house, and my boat, and everything. How am I gonna come up with $50,000 by tomorrow?

Quagmire:
 Well, you could whore yourself out to 1,000 fat chicks for $50 apiece. Or 50 really fat chicks for $1,000. What? Don't look at me like that. Fat chicks need love, too. But they got to pay.

Peter:
 What is this?

Waitress:
 Sea water, courtesy of that gentleman over there.

Hennessey:
 You need $50,000, Griffin? I got a suggestion for you. Why don't you kill Daggermouth?

Peter:
 Maybe I will, Hennessey.

Shamus:
 You'd be buying yourself a one-way ticket to a watery grave. Daggermouth is the meanest, most ruthless creature that's ever inhabited the sea. Legend has it he dwells out by Fish Stench Cove. He'll kill any man that comes near there. I saw him once. Sure I'm blind in one eye, and my other eye was infected that day from picking at it, and I was tired, and I'd been swimming in a pool with too much chlorine, and that was the hour my glasses were at Lenscrafters but I seen that fish!

Peter:
 If there's $50,000 in it, I don't think I got a choice.

Shamus:
 You can whore yourself out to 1,000 fat chicks for $50.

Quagmire:
 Nah, nah, we covered that.

Hennessey:
 You ain't got a chance, Griffin. Daggermouth killed my friend Salty. And he was twice the fisherman you are. And half the weight!

Peter:
 Hey-no! No! Hot!

Joe:
 He's right, Peter. It'd be suicide to go after that fish. There's gotta be another way.

Cleveland:
 We could have a bake sale.

Quagmire:
 Oh, now, see, I think that's a neat idea.

Peter:
 No! I am not gonna let my family live on the street. Not even if it means ending up like Shamus here. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny.

Quagmire:
 So, were you like, in an accident, or what?

Shamus:
 No. Me father was a tree.

Peter:
 What's wrong with me? I got to be crazy to think I can kill that man-eating fish. I mean, what the hell am I doing?

Jim:
 Hey, hey, hey, come on, Peter. What kind of talk is that?

Abby:
 Yeah, you can do it. Who's my big brave boy, huh?

Peter:
 Me.

Abby:
 Who's my big brave boy?

Abby:
 [blowing raspberries on Peter's stomach]

Meg:
 This sucks, Mom.

Lois:
 Meg, stop moping. These are the best years of your life. Now, let's get up there and live a little, huh?

Meg:
 Mom, I look like an idiot!

Lois:
 No, you don't. Come on. Just move your hips a little like this.

Crowd:
 [Chanting] Lois! Lois! Lois!

Lois:
 Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg!

Crowd:
 Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg!

Lois:
 Atta girl! Shake your moneymaker!

Crowd:
 Meg! Meg! Meg!

Man:
 Oh, my God! It's a chick!

school janitor:
 [Repeating in Spanish]

Cop:
 All right, everybody! This party's over!

Man:
 Why do you cops always have to kill our buzz?

Cop:
 He used a teenage colloquialism. Get the tear gas.

Joe:
 Not so fast, big guy.

Peter:
 What are you guys doing here?

Cleveland:
 We're gonna help you kill the fish.

Peter:
 But this is gonna be dangerous. We could all die.

Quagmire:
 Oh, come on. You're our best friend, Peter. Besides, I can remember a time when you saved all our butts.

Peter:
 Yeah, too bad I didn't get there until after the sodomy. All right, let's go kick some fish ass!

Meg:
 I can't believe I just showed everyone my tater tots. Worst of all, now I'm gonna have a police record.

Lois:
 Now, Meg, if you're gonna grab ahold of life, you've gotta expect to get your hands dirty once in a while.

Meg:
 It was kind of cool that people noticed me.

Lois:
 That's the spirit, honey. Okay, one, two, three, tuck and roll!

Peter:
 We're right on course, guys. Give me another beer.

Joe:
 You know, these are the precious moments. The four of us out at sea, miles away from civilization, tossing back brews.

Peter:
 Amen to that, Joe. Hey, you guys, here's one for you. Let's say none of us were married, all right? If you could have any woman in the world, who would it be?

Joe:
 Mariel Hemingway.

Peter:
 Come on. Really?

Cleveland:
 Not a very good choice.

Quagmire:
 She's jagged.

Joe:
 No. I think she's very attractive in a classical kind of way.

Quagmire:
 Yeah, but you could cut a roast on her face.

Cleveland:
 I would go with Margaret Thatcher.

All:
 Margaret Thatcher?

Peter:
 Why the hell Margaret Thatcher?

Cleveland:
 Oh, so nobody here thinks power is sexy? Not one of you finds power sexy?

Joe:
 How about you, Peter?

Peter:
 Oh, like you got to ask. The chick with three knockers from Total Recall.

Joe:
 Interesting.

Cleveland:
 I never saw that movie.

Quagmire:
 Hey, you know one was papier-mâché, right?

Peter:
 Oh, jeez, can I change my answer? Of course I know it's paper! I don't care! What's wrong with you? What about you, Quagmire?

Joe:
 Taylor Hanson's a guy.

Quagmire:
 You guys are yanking me. Hey, let's put one over on old Quagmire.

Quagmire:
 Well, well, this is insane! That's impossible! Oh, my God, Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, God! I got all these magazines. Oh, God! Oh, God!

Joe:
 [gasping] This must be Fish Stench Cove.

Peter:
 All right. Now all we got to do is find the fish.

Terry Jones:
 I wonder where that fish did go. A fish, a fish, a fishy, oh.

Joe:
 I heard that when Daggermouth eats you, he devours your guts first.

Cleveland:
 I heard he doesn't just eat you, he eats your soul!

Peter:
 I heard one of Shannen Doherty's eyes is off-center 'cause it's trying to escape!

Daggermouth:
 Welcome, gentlemen!

Quagmire:
 It's him! Quick, shoot him!

Daggermouth:
 Not so fast! Perhaps I could offer you a glass of port. And you a glass of starboard. That's a little nautical joke. I'm a fish, you see. I'm also delightfully mad. Oh dear, would you mind holding still for a moment? These antique pistols take about ten minutes to reload.

Joe:
 Peter, catch!

Peter:
 Ow! Don't throw stuff at me, Joe!

Cleveland:
 Peter, shoot him!

Peter:
 Oh, yeah. Right. My God! Isn't it amazing that that's what we all look like on the inside?

Salty:
 It's a robot, you idiot.

Joe:
 Who are you?

Salty:
 I'm Salty.

Peter:
 Salty? But everybody said you were killed by that fish.

Salty:
 That's what I wanted them to think. I disappeared and spread the Daggermouth rumor myself.

Peter:
 Why?

Salty:
 Merchandise! Daggermouth t-shirts, mugs, posters. And I'm in talks with Nickelodeon for a cartoon show. Figured I'd pair him with an effeminate cat. What do you think?

Peter:
 I'd watch that.

Joe:
 Sure, sure

Quagmire:
 Me, too.

Cleveland:
 Sounds like a good balance.

Salty:
 And now I'm gonna give you $50,000 to be on your way.

Peter:
 $50,000? For what?

Salty:
 To keep your mouth shut! And because the longer we stay here the more people'll question how a fisherman with no engineering background managed to build a sophisticated talking fish robot.

Lois:
 Honey, I'm really sorry for how I acted. Getting so drunk, and ditching you at the bar and letting those boys take pictures of you while you were sleeping. I was so busy having fun, I guess I kind of ruined it for you.

Lois:
 Uh-oh, we got company.

Meg:
 Looks like your fans are back, Mom.

Cool kids:
 Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg!

Lois:
 No, I think this one's all yours.

Cool girl:
 You go, girl!

Announcer:
 And now, back to Daggermouth and Boom Boom on Nickelodeon.

Daggermouth:
 Boom Boom, did you do your exercises today?

Boom Boom:
 Yes. I did 20 laps. And I'm about to do 20 more!

Daggermouth:
 Oh, you!

Boom Boom:
 Yipes!

Lois:
 Oh, Peter, I'm so glad being a fisherman is working out for you. You know I gotta admit I half expected to come home, and all our stuff would be gone, and we'd owe somebody a whole lot of money.

Peter:
 How can you "half expect" something?

Lois:
 I don't know. It's just a turn of phrase.

Peter:
 How do you "turn a phrase"?

Lois:
 God, you're dumb! Thank God for that ass! Now, come here and kiss me. Good night, honey.

Peter:
 Good night, Lois. Good night, Jim and Abby.

 Abby:
 Good night.

Lois:
 Okay. I got the whole day planned. First, we see the primates. Then the butterfly house. Then a bathroom break. Then we'll...

Peter:
 Come on, Lois. Can't we all run around in a disorganized fashion?

Stewie:
 Let it go, Lois!

Chris:
 Monkeys throw their poop!

Lois:
 No. If we don't adhere to a strict schedule, we won't see everything.

Peter:
 Kids, gas masks. Run!

Stewie:
 There you are. Oh, don't be such a pig, Mr. Pig. Now, where's Mr. Sheep? Is he being baaa-shful? [Laughing] That's right. You're all ripe for parody.

Brian:
 Can we go now?

Stewie:
 Shut up! I'm having fun. Oh, my! Someone's awfully rude. My fanny is not on the menu! What? Oh! Oh, God!

Peter:
 Here, little fella. Come get the food. I have always wanted to do this.

Lois:
 Oh, here are the marsupials. Peter, what the hell are you doing?

Peter:
 Look at me, Lois. I'm Roo! Come on, Ma. Let's go watch Pooh trick the bees out of their honey by pretending he's a rain cloud.

Stewie:
 I am going to kick your ass.

Brian:
 How's it going?

Man:
 Great. Beautiful day.

Brian:
 Oh, gorgeous. You know, we sit here and force small talk while they have the time of their lives.

Brian:
 [Whistles] Here, girl. [Shuddering] Sorry. I thought I smelled...cookies.

Mort Goldman:
 Wow! Does it really smell like...oh, God! She farted, and it went down my throat!

Peter:
 Full house.

Cleveland:
 Dagnab! That's some poker face you've got, Peter.

Peter:
 Years of practice, boys.

Joe:
 Peter, you're on a roll. We ought to get you down to Atlantic City this weekend.

Peter:
 Sorry, guys. Lois is making me visit the in-laws this weekend. I don't know why she even bothers. Me and Lois's old man have never gotten along.

Peter:
 Hey, I got an e-mail from Mr. Pewterschmidt!

Joe:
 You should find some common ground with your father-in-law, Peter. Figure out what he likes, and study up on it.

Peter:
 Hey, that's a great idea. I'll learn how to act like a rich guy. I'm gonna start right now. Cratchit, you're working through Christmas!

Bob Cratchit:
 But, sir, what of Tiny Tim?

Peter:
 Bah! He and his ukulele shall go wanting.

Peter:
 Huh-The New Yorker. I bet Lois's dad reads this. "I'd be more apathetic if I weren't so lethargic." [Crickets chirping] [crickets chirping] Oh, I get it. That's kind of funny. Yeah. Can I have a copy of Jugs?

Teacher:
 In French, when you want to say "yes," you say "oui, oui."

Peter:
 You gotta be kidding me! Oh, my God! That is hysterical! Oh, man! And what do you say for no? "Doo-doo"? Hey, I'll be right back. I gotta go take a wicked "yes."

Crowd:
 [Exclaiming with comprehension]

Guy:
 It's a person.

Lois:
 Peter, would you please fix the bathroom faucet?

Peter:
 I fixed it already.

Lois:
 No, you didn't. It's still dripping.

Peter:
 No way! I will give you all my Star Wars cards if it is. Wait, wait. Except Boba Fett. No matter how sure I am, I never risk the Fett man.

Lois:
 Oh, my God! [Gasping] Was he just mastur...

Peter:
 Yes.

Lois:
 Oh, my!

Peter:
 Do we-do we rub his nose in it?

Lois:
 Oh, hi, Brian.

Brian:
 Uh, listen, Lois, about yesterday...

Lois:
 Oh, Brian. It's nothing to be embarrassed about. It's perfectly normal.

Brian:
 I know. It's just, you know, I should be able to control my baser instincts. But lately I've just been having these urges.

Lois:
 Brian, why don't you come up to my parents' house with us? The fresh air will help you relax.

Stewie:
 I know where I go when I want to relax. [Stewie at gay dance club] I know the guy that owns this place!

Stewie:
 I said, I know the guy that...I'll tell you later. I love this song.

Brian:
 Thanks. But I think a quiet weekend here by myself is just the thing I need.

Lois:
 well, have a good time.

Brian:
 All right, I'm just gonna relax, mellow out, and watch some television.

Announcer:
 We now return to "World's Sluttiest Dogs" on Fox.

Brian:
 Hey, wait up!

Peter:
 [laughs] Right into the bumper.

Lois:
 Hi, Mom.

Barbara:
 Oh, look at you all. I know someone who's getting a gift certificate for liposuction in her stocking.

Meg:
 Thank you, Nana.

Carter:
 Hello, everyone.

Lois:
 Hi, Daddy.

Peter:
 Bonjour, Monsieur Pewterschmidt.

Carter:
 Did Peter have a stroke?

Lois:
 No, Daddy. Peter's cultured himself, like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman.

Carter:
 Oh, so I should treat him like a high-class whore.

Peter:
 That's fine. Just no kissing on the lips.

Barbara:
 Would you like a piece of candy?

Stewie:
 I smell death on you!

Peter:
 Ahoy, Mr. Pewterschmidt. Permission to come aboard?

Carter:
 No!

Peter:
 Thanks. Quite a schooner you got here. What is she, like, a 45-footer?

Carter:
 Peter, I didn't know you were a sailor.

Peter:
 I didn't know you looked so good in shorts. [Whistling and purring]

Carter:
 What?

Peter:
 You don't have an eye spliced in this mooring line. I'll tie a bowline in there and make one for you. That should hold her.

Sommelier:
 And this is a '74 Pinot Noir.

Peter:
 [Slurring] Where the hell is that Peter Griffin? He said he'd give me $100 if I took off all my clothes off.

Carter:
 [Growling]

Brian:
 Thanks for bringing me here, Lois. This is just what I needed.

Lois:
 I'm glad. It seems like everybody's having a lot of fun.

Masseuse:
 So, how long are you and your family in town?

Stewie:
 No conversation.

Carter:
 You idiot! I'm never taking you to my country club again!

Peter:
 Look, I'm sorry, Mr. Pewterschmidt.

Carter:
 Your husband is a moron! He walks up to the premier of China and says, "Dong, where is my automobile?"

Peter:
 Lois, I tried to fit in with your dad's crowd, but it's worse than before. I tell ya, this sucks worse than that time I was on Survivor.

Peter:
 How dare you wash your clothes in our drinking water, Bebe? Now how are we gonna survive in this harsh, unforgiving terrain?

Bob Barker:
 All right, Donny, make sure the wheel goes all the way around.

Peter:
 [Fakes being afraid] Oh, no. Headhunters. Am I fired?

Lois:
 Daddy, Peter's been trying really hard to get you to like him. Couldn't you give him another chance? Let him join your poker game tomorrow night?

Carter:
 Sorry, honey. I'd rather be stuck in an elevator with Nathan Lane, Gilbert Gottfried, Carrot Top, uh, Sean Hayes.... well, you get the picture.

Lois:
 Please?

Lois:
 Okay. You know, maybe later I'll take Mom by the shoeshine place and introduce her to that nice mulatto boy who looks an awful lot like...

Carter:
 Say, would Peter like to play poker with us?

Lois:
 He'd love to, Daddy.

Carter:
 That sounds dynamite.

Carter:
 Brian, come over here and meet Seabreeze, my prize-winning dog. Isn't she a perfect specimen? I mean, look at these legs, and that beautiful coat, and feel the heat coming off of her genitalia. You could roast a marshmallow. That's how you can tell she's a champion. Go on, put your hand there.

Brian:
 Oh, boy. That is something.

Carter:
 Is that something?

Brian:
 That is something. That is hot.

Carter:
 Isn't she the most beautiful dog you've ever seen?

Brian:
 Yes, yes, she is a beautiful dog. And that's okay.

Carter:
 Gentlemen, this is Peter. He's the idiot my daughter married.

Michael Eisner:
 Michael Eisner.

Bill Gates:
 Bill Gates.

Carter:
 Bill, Peter's an antitrust lawyer with the Justice Department. Just kidding. He's a fisherman, or some stupid thing.

Ted Turner:
 Hey, fellas.

Peter:
 Wow! Ted Turner!

Carter:
 I told you guys not to invite him.

Michael Eisner:
 He must have followed us.

Ted Turner:
 Come on, ladies. Are we gonna play cards or what?

Carter:
 Peter, why don't you deal?

Peter:
 Okay, guys. We're playing Texas Hold 'Em.

Ted Turner:
 Are aces high or low?

Peter:
 They go both ways.

Bill Gates:
 He said, "They go both ways."

Ted Turner:
 Like a bisexual.

Michael Eisner:
 Thank you, Ted. That was the joke.

Ted Turner:
 I see your bet, Carter. And I raise you CNN.

Carter:
 I don't think I can...

Peter:
 Wait, wait, wait. You can beat him, Mr. Pewterschmidt. He's bluffing.

Carter:
 Peter, he just bet CNN. There's no way he's bluffing.

Peter:
 I'm sure he is. He's got a tell. Listen, if you lose this hand, I'll divorce your daughter.

Carter:
 I'm in. All right, Teddy. I'll see your CNN with US Steel. What do you got?

Ted Turner:
 Two pair.

Carter:
 Ace-high straight.

Ted Turner:
 You sold me out. I could use a man like you. How's $1 million a year sound? You disgust me! Get out of my face!

Carter:
 Peter, that's the first time any of us have ever beaten Ted.

Bill Gates:
 Yeah. How did you know he was bluffing?

Peter:
 Well, when he lies, he blinks twice. I first noticed it when he did that Barbara Walters interview, and he said he'd be with Jane Fonda forever.

Bill Gates:
 Well, I'm gonna turn in.

Michael Eisner:
 Yeah. Me, too. I gotta be at Disneyland before it opens. We're ethnically cleansing the "Small World" ride.

Peter:
 Come on. You guys practically run this country. There's gotta be a ton of fun stuff we could do.

Bill Gates:
 All right!

Peter:
 Oh, man! There's a tollbooth. Hey, anybody got a quarter?

Peter:
 Well, we gotta give him something.

Peter:
 Man, looking up at the sky just makes you feel so small.

Bill Gates:
 Yeah. I mean, if God created all this, who created God?

Michael Eisner:
 Maybe he created himself.

Peter:
 Or herself. Think about that.

Bill Gates:
 Neat. This guy's deep, Carter. Where'd you find him?

Carter:
 He's my son-in-law.

Bill Gates:
 Okay, honey. I gotta go, you want a ride?

Michael Eisner:
 Sure.

Carter:
 Peter, I actually had a good time with you tonight. And I just want to say-well-I'm glad you married my daughter.

Peter:
 Thank you, Jesus.

Jesus:
 Actually, it wasn't me. It was...

Vishnu:
 No, no. It's okay. I'm used to it.

Carter:
 Having fun, Peter?

Peter:
 You bet. I put all my poker winnings on your dog, Mr. P.

Brian:
 Dog?

Carter:
 You got nothing to worry about. Seabreeze is a sure thing.

Brian:
 Seabreeze?

Chris:
 Dad, where are the jockeys?

Peter:
 They're all in the laundry, son. I'm going Indian today.

Lois:
 Come on, Seabreeze!

Peter:
 Yeah! Come on! Come on! Go! Go! Go!

Brian:
 [shuddering]

Lois:
 What's Brian doing?

Carter:
 He's violating Seabreeze!

Peter:
 No, no, he's just awkwardly positioning himself-now he's violating Seabreeze.

Stewie:
 [Making funky porn-style music]

Brian:
 Mr. Pewterschmidt, again, I just want to tell you how sorry I am about this. I don't know what came over me.

Carter:
 You had better not have ruined my race dog!

Peter:
 Brian, I am very disappointed in you! I'd turn my back on you, but I've seen what you do in that situation. Now, if you'll excuse me, Carter and I have a polio match to attend.

Carter:
 Get away from me! You and that filthy mongrel of yours! How is she, Doctor?

Veternarian:
 She's fine. Seabreeze will be able to race again. But, unfortunately, not for another nine weeks. She's pregnant.

Brian:
 Look, Mr. Pewterschmidt, I just want you to know, I am going to do the right thing here.

Carter:
 You're not doing anything! In fact, you're never going to see Seabreeze again! All of you, pack your things and get out!

Peter:
I am never speaking to you again. Don't worry, Mr. Pewterschmidt. I have a plan. I am gonna go back in time and stop Brian from getting it on with your dog. Everybody stand back. [wailing] Oh, boy. Oh, God. Ah.

Peter:
 Mr. Pewterschmidt, please? Can we still be pals? See, look. I made a picture of you and me out of glue and macaroni.

Carter:
 Wow, Peter! That means a lot to me because you made it.

Carter:
 No! Get out of here!

Veternarian:
 Mr. Pewterschmidt! Seabreeze is gone!

Lois:
 I can't find Brian.

Carter:
 Peter, you know what I'm going to do to you if Brian took off with my Seabreeze?

Peter:
 I think I have an idea. [sobbing]

Man:
 This is the room. The light switch is here. It's mostly for show. There's your Murphy bed. Don't mind the Epsteins. They keep to themselves.

 Epstein:
 We're going to see Bobby Darin at the Copa tomorrow, right, Charlie?

 Epstein:
 Bobby Darin tomorrow.

Man:
 This is the bathroom. But watch out. We got some bad roaches here.

Brian:
 Those are bad roaches.

Man:
 I blame the schools.

Brian:
 Were you followed?

Lois:
 Don't worry. I've got a decoy.

Quagmire:
 Hi, Lois. Hubba-hubba. Whoa, Lois! You put on a few, huh?

Chris:
 Well, I never!

Stewie:
 That's all right, honey. I don't think he was the one anyway. Now, let's go get sundaes.

Lois:
 You know, we all really miss you. And Peter talks about you all the time.

Brian:
 Oh, really? Anything nice?

Brian:
 So, he's still mad, huh?

Lois:
 Well, I should go. Here. Take this. It's probably not a good idea for us to meet anymore. Daddy swore he'd track you down any way he could.

Michael Eisner:
 Bingo!

Bill Gates:
 I told you she'd lead us to him. Let's call Pewterschmidt.

Michael Eisner:
 No, wait. Let's take the jetpacks!

Bill Gates:
 Cool!

Michael Eisner:
 Man! The people look like ants from up here.

Bill Gates:
 They are ants, Michael. They are ants.

Tricia Takanawa:
 This is Tricia Takanawa reporting live, where police have discovered the whereabouts of Seabreeze, the heiress to the Pewterschmidt fortune. The dognapper has been traced to this sleazy motel. Ah, I see my colleague Tom Tucker is already on the scene.

Prostitute:
 Who's that, baby?

Tom Tucker:
 Hello, this is Tom Tucker's...evil twin, Todd Tucker out to destroy his brother's reputation. [fake evil laugh] I'm going back inside to have freaky sex with my prostitute with whom I still have 45 minutes. Now, back to this breaking news.

Lois:
 Brian, please, eat something.

Brian:
 Why bother? My face is plastered all over the news. Your father won't let me see the dog who's carrying my puppies. And my best friend is going to incredible lengths to ignore me.

Lois:
 Brian, don't let him get to you. Peter, come out of that thing!

Brian:
 He can't hear you, Lois. Besides, it's not him that's getting to me, it's your father.

Lois:
 I'm sorry. I talked to him, but he wouldn't budge. He can be so stubborn. I don't know how my mother puts up with it. He did promise to take good care of the puppies though.

Brian:
 Well, you know, they're not his to take care of. They're my kids! And I'm gonna get them back. My father wasn't there for me, but dammit I'm gonna be there for my kids! I'm gonna sue your dad for custody!

Lois:
 Daddy, please, stop this. Brian has every right to see his puppies when they're born.

Carter:
 Sorry, pumpkin.

Lois:
 I had no idea you could be so cruel. I'll never forgive you for this!

Carter:
 Oh, you'll be fine. You're just having your period.

Judge:
 This court will now come to order.

Lawyer:
 Brian, do you like children?

Brian:
 I love children. That's why I'm here. I want the opportunity to raise my puppies.

Lawyer:
 Do you remember an incident at a South Attleboro Denny's in December of 1996?

Brian:
 Yeah, I guess.

Brian:
 [screaming back] You like that? You like that? [Screaming] You just tune this out, don't you? Well, tune this out! [Screaming]

Brian:
 Shut up! <back in court> Look, I was angry because my Moon Over Mi-hammy was overcooked...

Lawyer:
 I also have your rental records from the Quahog Video Store. Can you read the last two titles, please?

Brian:
 Son-In-Law and Bio-dome.

Lawyer:
 And who's the star of those films?

Brian:
 Pauly Shore.

Lawyer:
 Pauly Shore!

Man:
 He's terrible!

Brian:
 But I rented those for Peter. He got banned from the video store for taping over their movies.

Charles Foster Kane:
 Rosebud.

Peter:
 It's his sled. It was his sled from when he was a kid. There. I just saved you two long, boobless hours.

Lawyer:
 How convenient! Blame it on someone else. Is that the kind of man we want raising these puppies?

Brian:
 Peter? You got to believe me, Your Honor.

Carter:
 Uh, Peter, I'm putting together another card game. You in?

Peter:
 You want me to play?

Carter:
 Absolutely. But first I want you to testify against that horny mutt of yours.

Peter:
 I don't know if I can do that.

Carter:
 Ooh, that's too bad. Because Bill and Michael really want to see you again. They're coming over later, and Bill's going to bring his Stretch Armstrong.

Peter:
 Oh, man! And his arms stretch out to next week!

Carter:
 Your Honor, Peter Griffin would like to take the stand.

Lawyer:
 Mr. Griffin, which of the following two phrases best describes Brian Griffin? "Problem drinker" or "African-American haberdasher"?

Peter:
 I guess "problem drinker." But that's...

Lawyer:
 Thank you. "Sexual deviant" or "magic picture that you stare at till you see something"?

Peter:
 "Sexual deviant," but that other one's...

Lawyer:
 Thank you. Isn't it true that you told my client, Carter Pewterschmidt, that Brian is a menace to society and should never be allowed to see his children?

Peter:
 Brian should be allowed to see his puppies!

Carter:
 Peter, think about what you're doing.

Peter:
 I am. Your Honor, Brian'll be a great dad. Hell, if I was half the parent Brian is, I'd know that Chris's favorite ice cream is...

Brian:
 Chocolate-chip.

Peter:
 And Stewie's favorite bedtime story is...

Brian:
 Goodnight, Moon.

Peter:
 And Meg's real father's name is...

Meg:
 [Pop music on headphones]

Judge:
 I've heard enough. I do believe that Brian would be a successful parent. However, if he was to repeat his actions at the dog track he would be setting a bad example for his puppies. Therefore, I grant Brian custody with the condition that he be neutered first.

Peter:
 Yeah! You did it, buddy! Congratulations! Oh, man! What does "neutered" mean?

Brian:
 You're almost there, Seabreeze. Oh, and, also, I didn't bring this up before, but promise me you won't eat any of them.

Carter:
 You know, Brian, it occurs to me that this is like a Greek tragedy where a man must choose between himself and his children. Of course, you'll be playing the role of "Sans Testaclese."

Veternarian:
 We're ready for you, down the hall.

Peter:
 Are you sure you want to go through with this, Brian? Because you could have puppies with another dog. Oh, maybe with a condor! Then you'd have flying puppies. Would you like that, Brian? Flying puppies?

Brian:
 No, Peter. Those puppies in there are mine. And I'll give anything to be with them. Anything.

Peter:
 I am not looking forward to what you'll be like once they do this to you.

Brian:
 I love chocolate! But I can't eat it, because then I'll get fat. But it's so good!

Veternarian:
 Are you ready, Brian?

Brian:
 I guess so.

Lois:
 Stop! Brian, come quick!

Brian:
 Oh, my God! Those aren't my puppies!

Peter:
 Well, then whose are they?

Carter:
 You! You're a whore! A filthy, filthy whore!

Lois:
 You must be so relieved.

Brian:
 Well, actually, I was kind of looking forward to being a dad.

Peter:
 Don't worry. There'll be other chances.

Peter:
 You know what's funny? I always thought that dogs laid eggs. And I learned something today.

Barbara:
 Hi, Chris.

Chris:
 [Hyperventilating] Hi, Barbara.

Barbara:
 I'm having a birthday party next week. I was hoping you could come.

Chris:
 Oh, no! Someone peed in my pants!

Barbara:
 You're funny. Well, I hope you can make it.

Lois:
 Your friend's birthday party sounds like fun, Chris.

Peter:
 Yeah, but, I hope for your sake, the cake's better than the last party I went to.

Stripper:
 [Screaming]

Peter:
 Oh, God! Coconut!

Chris:
 I want to get Barbara a really nice gift. What kind of gifts have boys gotten for you, Meg?

Meg:
 Oh, well...my boyfriend, Prince William, got me this beautiful watch and this diamond tiara, and this wonderful scepter. [Manic laughter] [Sobbing]

Stewie:
 She needs to get laid big-time.

Peter:
 Listen, Chris, I read a book saying that women are from Venus, all right? So, here's what you get her. Thick layers of sulfuric acid, viscous surface rock and coronae which seem to be collapsed domes over large magma chambers. Here's $5.

Chris:
 Well, that's okay, Dad. I was thinking about getting a paper route, so I could pay for Barbara's gift myself.

Lois:
 Oh, well, I think that's very sweet, honey.

Peter:
 Oh, boy! I remember my first job. I was in a folk-music trio. [flashback] Hey, how about "Here's to you, Mrs. Fleckenstein"?

Paul Simon:
 You've been pitching that for an hour, but it's just not a very attractive name.

Peter:
 Fine, fine. I suppose we're also not going with "Parsley, Sage, Rosemary, and Lowrey's Seasoning Salt." That's it. I'm going to 'Nam.

Herbert:
 Well, hey there, young fella. Bringing me good news today?

Herbert:
 Come on over here, son. Hand me the paper, so I don't need to use my grabber. That's a nice muscly throwing arm you got there.

Chris:
 Thanks.

Herbert:
 Got a nice tip for you right here in my pocket. But my arthritis.... Why don't you reach in there and fish it out for yourself?

Chris:
 Oh, that's okay, mister. I don't collect until the end of the month. I'll see you tomorrow. Weird.

Chris:
 I hope you like it.

Barbara:
 Wow, perfume! That is so sweet.

Chris:
 It'll make you smell like Elizabeth Taylor. I guess that means you'll smell like bourbon and Vicodin.

Barbara:
 That's very thoughtful.

Chris:
 Can I spray some on you?

Barbara:
 Oh, my eyes!

Chris:
 You're beautiful!

Barbara:
 Just get away from me, Chris!

Chris:
 I'm so awkward!

Herbert:
 Hey, muscly arm, why the long face?

Chris:
 It's this girl. I can't talk to her. It's like girls are a different species or something.

Herbert:
 Who needs them? You like Popsicles?

Chris:
 Well, sure.

Herbert:
 Then you need to come on down to the cellar. I got a whole freezer full of Popsicles. Mmmm....

Chris:
 No, thanks. I gotta get going.

Herbert:
 Don't make me beg, now.

Chris:
 You're funny. Bye.

Herbert:
 Get your fat ass back here.

Robber:
 This is a holdup! Open the register!

Clerk:
 I can't! It only opens when you make a sale!

Robber:
 Then give me one of them horoscope scrolls and some Skittles! "Financial transaction benefits you today." Ooh!

Clerk:
 Weird!

Robber:
 All right, a bike! I'm out of here!

Cop:
 Now, son, your parents are on their way. But since time is a factor here, we'd like to get a positive ID as quickly as possible.

Chris:
 Are you sure he can't see me?

Cop:
 Absolutely, Chris. You're 100 percent safe.

Chris:
 Okay, that's him. Number six.

Peter:
 Hi. Excuse me, you guys. I'm here to pick up my son, Chris Griffin. He's here to finger the guy who held up that convenience store. Maybe you've seen him. His name is Chris Griffin. I think I got a picture of him, somewhere. Here you go. Yeah, you can go ahead and hang on to that. I got a ton of them at home. In fact, I was gonna throw that one out anyway, 'cause Chris messed it up by writing his school schedule and a list of his fears all over the back of it.

Lois:
 Oh! We're so proud of you, Chris, for helping to put that horrible man in jail.

Peter:
 Jeez, you couldn't have said it was Celine Dion, huh? Our one chance to put that showboating Canadian wench behind bars and you blow it.

Announcer:
 We now return to the E! True Hollywood Story. Alf.

Alf:
 By the third season, I was completely wasted all the time. I had lost all control of my bodily functions. They had to cut the crap out of my fur before each taping. But would I do it all again?

Tom Tucker:
 We interrupt this program for a breaking news story. We now go live to the Rhode Island State Penitentiary, where Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa is standing by. Tricia?

Tricia Takanawa:
 Tom, I'm outside this maximum-security facility where a ruthless thug has engineered a daring escape. Sir, do you have any plans now that you're out of jail?

Robber:
 Yeah. I'm gonna go bang my girlfriend, and then I'm gonna kill Chris Griffin!

Stewie:
 Good lord! Can they really say "bang my girlfriend" on TV?

Lois:
 You want to remove us from the area?

Stewie:
 Oh, Is Europe an option? I say, I've always wanted to spend a year in Prague teaching English. You know, slacking off a bit, but really getting to know myself.

Peter:
 Deep South? Isn't that where the black guys are really lazy and all the white guys are just as lazy but are mad at the black guys for being so lazy?

FBI Agent:
 I suggest you start packing immediately.

Meg:
 I can't believe I have to change schools because of you! This is all your fault, Lardo!

Peter:
 Me? I had nothing to do with it.

Meg:
 No. I meant Chris!

Peter:
 Oh. Yeah, Lardo!

Lois:
 Look, everybody. Here we are. The town of Bumblescum.

Meg:
 This is our house?

Lois:
 Oh, come on, Meg! I bet if we fixed it up a little bit, it could be a piece of crap.

Lois:
 Oh, what's that smell?

Brian:
 It's either bad meat or good cheese.

Peter:
 There's a penny underneath that couch.

Meg:
 Somebody's in the closet!

Jeff Foxworthy:
 You know you're a redneck when your gun rack has a gun rack on it!

Stewie:
 You suck!

Lois:
 Oh, my! Well, it's too hot to cook anyway. Peter, what's the upstairs like?

Peter:
 There's a crunchberry underneath the fridge.

Meg:
 Mom, Chris found a jar in the basement! And it has a hand in it!

Chris:
 I'm gonna plant it and see if a human grows!

Peter:
 Well, at least the TV gets decent reception. Must be some kind of nature show. Help! Help! Get it off! Get if off!

Meg:
 Great. We're here five minutes, and Dad gets mauled by a rodent.

Brian:
 This place is horrible.

Lois:
 Okay. Now, everybody calm down. We don't know anything about this community. I bet if we explore the town, we'll each find something about it we like.

Peter:
 You know, that's a great idea, Lois. I just got to hit the can.

Lois:
 I think there's just an outhouse, Peter.

Peter:
 Hey, Lois, I don't get how this works. It's just a hole. I don't think it goes anywhere. No, it definitely doesn't go anywhere. Oh! Oh, God! Oh, it's everywhere! It's in my raccoon wounds! Oh, God!

Lois:
 Excuse me. Do you have an ATM?

Redneck:
 Over there, ma'am.

Redneck Banker:
 How much you want to take out?

Lois:
 $40.

Redneck Banker:
 There's a service charge of $1.50. Do y'all accept?

Redneck Banker:
 Mmm. You smell like the inside of my mama's purse.

Lois:
 Thank you.

Musician:
 [Playing banjo music]

Stewie:
 What are those dulcet tones? Why, this is the music of the angels! What is that magical device?

Musician:
 Banjo. Pluck that string.

Stewie:
 Oh! I feel so deliciously white trash! Mommy, I want a mullet!

Peter:
 All right, that about does it. Isn't she beautiful, Brian?

Brian:
 The Duke boys would be proud, Peter.

Peter:
 Yeah, and you got to get in through the window, like this. Okay. Now you. Oh, sorry. I forgot to roll yours down. You all right? Hello? Wake up, sleepyhead.

Chris:
 Hi.

Sam:
 Hi.

Chris:
 Are you mad at that pond?

Sam:
 Shoot, no! 'Course, this pond did kill my grandpappy. He saw his reflection in the water, thought it was him and drowned trying to save himself.

Chris:
 That's why my mom doesn't let me look in the toilet.

Sam:
 I'm Sam.

Chris:
 I'm Chris.

s Father:
 Sam, come on in, now.

Sam:
 Well, I gotta go help my daddy bring in the mud harvest. Nice making your acquaintance, Chris.

Chris:
 Oh, my God! I'm drowning!

Radio:
 And that was Merle Haggard with "I Kissed My Sweetie With My Fist." Coming up next...

Peter:
 All right. Here's one. Let's jump that. [Yelling triumphantly] Oh, that was great! Hey, next time let's get Meg to be Boss Hogg and Chris can be Anus.

Brian:
 Enos.

Peter:
 What'd I say?

Brian:
 "Anus."

All:
 Wow!

Meg:
 We sure do.

Teacher:
 All right, class. That's enough questions for Megan. Time to hand back last week's spelling tests. And it looks like Oinky has set the curve again.

Lois:
 Ta da! Possum Surprise. Actually, I made it with Shake 'N Bake.

Stewie:
 And I helped!

Lois:
 Kids, where's your father?

Lois:
 Peter, what the hell are you doing?

Peter:
 I'm blending in. Relax, Lois. It's not our house.

Lois:
 I'm glad you're having fun, but we need some money. Have you thought about looking for a job?

Peter:
 Yes, Lois, I have. But I've also thought about getting fired from that job. Is that something you really want to put our family through? Think about that while I get myself a drink. Oh, God!

Sam:
 It's right up here past this clearing. He's been here about three months now.

Chris:
 Wow! Where do you think you go when you die?

Sam:
 I learnt at church that if you're good, you go to Heaven. But if you're bad, you go to a place where the dead believe they're still living and they pray for death, but death won't come.

Chris:
 UPN?

Sam:
 You're funny. I like you, Chris.

Chris:
 I like you too, Sam.

Sam:
 Want to poke him?

Chris:
 Do I! You know, it's true. The best things in life really are free.

Peter:
 I don't know, Brian. Maybe Lois is right. Maybe it is time for me to get a job.

Brian:
 Yeah, too bad you always blow it in the interview.

Peter:
 [Thinking] Don't say, "Doing your wife." Don't say, "Doing your wife." Don't say, "Doing your wife." [aloud] Doing your...son? Hey, Brian, look at that!

Sheriff:
 Interested? We just take turns being the sheriff. It's real easy. You just hang out here, eat some pie, and get drunk.

Peter:
 Wait. Hold on a second. "Pie," "drunk," "the"? You got yourself a sheriff!

Peter:
 [Slurring] Boy, it's so quiet around here!

Brian:
 I know.

Peter:
 The phone hasn't rang all day.

Brian:
 I-I know. There's nothing to...[Stuttering] [Sighing] Oh, boy! What's the word I'm looking for? "Do"!

Peter:
 Oh, Brian, you're drunk. You're drunk. Give me your keys.

Chris:
 What is this, Dad?

Peter:
 A Southern tradition, son. It's a reenactment of the Civil War.

Redneck:
 Robert E. Lee, I knew I'd find you here where they seat the sorry-ass losers!

s Father:
 Ulysses S. Grant, you invite me to lunch then show up an hour late, drunk?

Redneck:
 I was busy looking for your wife to give her the old...

s Father:
 Sir, this means war!

Redneck:
 I am vanquished.

s Father:
 I hereby declare victory in the name of the Confederacy!

Peter:
 Uh, excuse me. I don't think that's how it happened. I'm pretty sure the North won.

s Father:
 What are you saying, fella?

Peter:
 I'm saying that drunken idiot kicked your sorry asses south of the Donna Dixon line!

s Father:
 We don't take too kindly to that sort of talk, mister. And I sure as shoot don't want your kid hanging around with my kid. And if you think I'm mad now, you got to answer to them Civil War survivors!

Old Redneck:
 Yeah. That's right.

Brian:
 Wait! Look over there! It's a newly-married, interracial gay couple burning the American flag!

Old Redneck:
 Get 'em!

Chris:
 I guess we can't hang out anymore.

Sam:
 I guess not.

Chris:
 That sucks! 'Cause I really like spending time with you.

Sam:
 Me, too.

Chris:
 [Muffled protests] What are you doing?

Waylon Jennings:
 Them Griffin boys better grow some wings or start flapping their arms.

Chris:
 [writing in diary] "Man, was last night weird! I kissed a boy. But the truth is, I really like him as a friend. His name is Sam."

Brian:
 You kissed Sam last night?

Chris:
 How did you know?

Brian:
 Well, you're saying it out loud. I could hear you in the other room.

Chris:
 The weird thing is, kissing Sam kind of felt right. But I don't know if I can face him again. Brian, what should I do? I haven't been this confused since the end of "No Way Out"! [at movies] How does Kevin Costner keep getting work?

Robber:
 Telegram for Chris Griffin.

Robber:
 Where is he?

Robber:
 Oh, did I say Chris? I meant Chris's sister.

Sam:
 Oh, hi, Chris.

Chris:
 Hey. Listen, Sam. I like hanging out with you and all. It's just that I don't want a romantic relationship. But I'd like it if we could still be friends.

Sam:
 I'd like that, too. Want to go for a swim?

Chris:
 Sure. You're a girl?

Sam:
 Of course I am!

Chris:
 Oh, my God!

Stewie:
 [tuning banjo] Warm out today. Warm yesterday. Even warmer today.

Stewie:
 ? Met her on my CB, said her name was Venie ? ? Sounded like an angel come to Earth ?

Southerners:
 ? Come to Earth ?

Stewie:
 ? When I went to meet her ? ? Man you should've seen her ? ? Twice as tall as me, three times the girth ?

Southerners:
 ? Girth ?

Stewie:
 ? Oh, my fat baby loves to eat ?

Southerners:
 ? Loves to eat ?

Stewie:
 ? A big ol' Buddha belly and her breasts swing past her feet ?

Southerners:
 ? Feet ?

Stewie:
 ? My fat baby loves to ?

All:
 ? Eat ?

Stewie:
 ? My big ol' fat-ass baby loves to eat ?

Stewie:
 I'VE GOT BLISTERS ON ME FINGERS!

Peter:
 A drop more of the shine, my dear?

Lois:
 Yes, please.

Peter:
 You know, the kids are gonna be at that town social for a while.

Lois:
 I think I know where you're going.

Peter:
 Ah, ah, ah! Oh, God!

Peter:
 Oh, God!

Lois:
 Oh, hi. How is everything?

Lois:
 What? Peter, that criminal is on his way here to kill Chris!

Lois:
 We gotta call the sheriff!

Peter:
 Holy crap! I'm on it, Lois! "Sheriff's Office." Yes, hello. This is Peter Griffin. I'd like to report a dangerous criminal who may be coming to town. "I'm sorry, could you repeat your name?" It's Peter Griffin. G-R-l-F-F-l-N.

Lois:
 Wait a minute. You're the sheriff?

Peter:
 Hang on one sec, honey. I'm on the phone. "Who's that?" My wife.

Lois:
 Chris is in danger! Do something! Round up a posse!

Peter:
 Yeah, well, see, I kind of pissed off the whole town at that Civil War reenactment.

Lois:
 What are we gonna do?

Peter:
 I don't know, Lois. But I feel lower than a bow-legged caterpillar.

Buck Owen:
 [Chuckling] Now, here's Roy!

Stewie:
 Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Oh, and to the owner of a John Deere tractor, you're parked on top of a pig. John Deere tractor on top of a pig.

Chris:
 Sam, can I talk to you?

Sam:
 Sure. But why aren't you looking at me?

Chris:
 Well, that's the thing. I'm no good at talking to girls. That's why I ran away from you.

Sam:
 well, you didn't have trouble talking to me when you thought I was a boy.

Chris:
 Yeah, that's true.

Sam:
 Just pretend I'm a boy.

Sam:
 You want to go down to the old town bridge and make out?

Chris:
 Yes, sir!

Meg:
 And in the city, glasses are considered really sexy.

Boy:
 Dang! I hope her brother don't already have dibs on her.

Brian:
 Where's Chris? That criminal's here and he's after him.

Meg:
 He's down by the old town bridge. You know, my brother is the one he's here to kill!

Girl:
 My daughter would absolutely love you.

Sam:
 You're so cute. You're like a skinny Garth Brooks.

Robber:
 I got you now, Griffin!

Chris:
 [Exclaiming]

Peter:
 Not so fast, buddy!

Robber:
 Who are you?

Peter:
 Oh, you can call me Officer T.J. Hooker! Sheriff Officer T.J. Hooker! And this is my deputy, McMillan and Wife.

Robber:
 Well, I hated T.J. Hooker! And I never actually saw McMillan and Wife! Although I was aware of it! Anyway, you're dead!

Robber:
 You're mine now, fella!

Chris:
 [Screaming] Dad! Help! Help! Dad!

s Father:
 You folks all right?

Peter:
 Wow! You guys saved our lives. After I said that all Southern people have bad teeth and suffer from the gum disease known as gingivitis.

s Father:
 Well, we take care of our own. And as long as y'all live here, y'all are Southerners, too.

Peter:
 Wow, thanks!

s Father:
 It's our pleasure. Sam, I'll see you at home.

Peter:
 I think the lesson here is it doesn't matter where you're from, as long as we're all the same religion.

Teacher:
 It was great having you in class, Meg.

Meg:
 Thanks. I'm really gonna miss everybody.

Sam:
 I can't believe you're leaving.

Chris:
 Me, either. I'll be sure to write.

Sam:
 And I'll be sure to learn to read.

Chris:
 And the next time I see a dead guy I'm gonna poke him twice as hard for both of us.

Lois:
 It's so nice to be home.

Answering Machine:
 You have 113 new messages.

Herbert:
 Uh, yeah, I was just wondering where the newspaper boy was.

Herbert:
 Haven't seen a newspaper in a couple days. Wonderin' if he ever gonna come back.

Herbert:
 Guess who? Sorry to leave you so many messages. Just Ionely here. Thinkin' about the muscly-armed paperboy. Wishin' he'd come by and bring me some good news.

Herbert:
 Where are you?

Herbert:
 You're starting to piss me off, you little piggly son of a bitch. Call me.

ois:
 Okay. I got the whole day planned. First, we see the primates. Then the butterfly house. Then a bathroom break. Then we'll...

Dennis Miller:
 I don't want to go on a rant here but America's foreign policy makes about as much sense as Beowulf having sex with Robert Fulton at the first Battle of Antietam. I mean, when a neo-conservative defenestrates it's like Raskolnikov filibuster deoxymonohydroxinate.

Peter:
 What the hell does "rant" mean?

Lois:
 Go, Dust Mites!

Peter:
 I wish they'd put Chris in already.

Lois:
 Peter, relax. It's his first game.

Coach:
 Griffin, get in there!

Lois:
 They're sending him in. Yay, Chris!

Peter:
 Atta boy, Chris! Hey, that's my son out there. I taught him how to wipe.

Jake Tucker:
 Why won't you teach me how to wipe, Dad?

Tom Tucker:
 Because you don't have a bottom, son.

Boy:
 You and that towel are representin'.

Chris:
 Yo, that sweat's just frightened, G!

Announcer:
 Ladies and gentlemen, the Buddy Cianci Junior High cheerleaders.

Cindi:
 Is everybody pumped up? Gimme a D-U-S-T!

Crowd:
 D-U-S-T

Cindi:
 M-I-T-E-S!

Stewie:
 M-I-T-E-S!

Cindi:
 What does that spell?

Stewie:
 Dust Mites!

Cindi:
 Who's gonna win this game?

Stewie:
 Dust Mites! My God, what-what just happened to me? It's those sirens. They have us all under their spell, like that hypnotist at the Airport Hilton.

Hypnotist:
 ...and three!

Brian:
 Oh, wow! Were we just hypnotized?

Stewie:
 Well, that's incredible. I don't remember a thing. Why do I taste crotch?

Stewie:
 I must unlock the secret to their mind-control powers.

Peter:
 Lois, can we go now? I'm starving.

Lois:
 The game's almost over, Peter. Try to think about something else.

Peter:
 Oh, sorry. Nice job out there tonight, Chris. You wiped the floor with that towel.

Chris:
 Yo! Did y'all check me when that hottie was all up in my Kool-Aid? Yeah, I was lookin' to break off a little somethin'-somethin' but my crew gave me the 411 on that skank and she's all about the bling-bling.

Lois:
 What's wrong?

Peter:
 He's speaking in tongues, Lois! Our son is possessed! Meg, start at Psalm 41 and don't stop reading until I tell you! The power of Christ compels you!

Chris:
 [screams]

Peter:
 The power of Christ compels you!

Lois:
 Peter, stop! He's not possessed.

Meg:
 Yeah, he's just talking street. Lots of kids do it.

Peter:
 Oh. Well, that's kind of weird.

Lois:
 Peter, it's just a phase. You've gone through a few yourself.

Brian:
 Like those two weeks you spent narrating your own life.

Peter:
 I walked into the kitchen and sat down at the table. I looked with a grimace at the questionable meal Lois had placed in front of me. Of course, I'd never tell her how disgusted I was with her cooking, but somehow I think she knew. Lois had always been full of energy and life but lately I had begun to grow more aware of her aging. The bright, exuberant eyes that I had fallen in love with were now beginning to grow dull and listless with the long fatigue of a weary life. I awoke several hours later in a daze.

Rapper:
 ? I was brought up on the streets, no moms and dads ? ? I had to fend for myself with my own two hands ? ? But today I'm hurtin' and I'll tell you why ? ? I got a hangnail ?

Backup rappers:
 Hangnail!

Rapper:
 ? Hanging from my cuticle ? ? A hangnail ?

Rapper:
 ? It ain't beautiful ? ? It hurts like a bitch that I did last night ?

Peter:
 Hey, Chris. Whatcha doin'?

Chris:
 Just laying back in the cot peepin' at this here homey. Yo, Pops! Let me have some cheddar. Some player-hater be throwin' salt in my game grillin' me over my gear. And I needs to be mackin' style!

Peter:
 Well, uh, the important thing is you tried, son.

Stewie:
 There they are. Very well. And now to infiltrate this coven and learn their mind-control secrets. Just need to get their attention.

Cindi:
 Okay. That was much better. But it still sucked worse than anything I've ever seen! What's wrong with you guys?

Stewie:
 My, so it's that easy to win you over! Consider yourselves lucky I'm not after your gully holes.

Peter:
 Then Chris starts in with all this "yo, yo, yo" stuff and I don't know what he's talkin' about. So I started beating him with a hose, then my arm got tired, so I came here.

Brian:
 Peter, perhaps Chris has adopted another culture's mannerisms because he doesn't know enough about his own.

Peter:
 Aw, gee, I never thought of that. You know, I should teach Chris about his Irish roots. Besides, we haven't spent any time together since we played Operation.

Chris:
 I'm going for the "funny bone," Dad.

Peter:
 Oh, you touched the sides. Oh, jeez, He's waking up. Let's get him back to the bus station.

Chris:
 Dad, I don't want to be here. I want to be chillin' with my homeys.

Peter:
 Now, Chris, it's important you learn about your Irish heritage.

Animatronic Irish baby:
 [crying]

Speaker:
 Ancient archeological evidence indicates that Ireland was a much different place before the discovery of alcohol. Most experts believe it was something like this.

Chris:
 You were right, Dad. Being Irish rocks!

Peter:
 That's more like it, son. Now, today we're gonna learn about the Griffin family history.

Chris:
 What's a library, Dad?

Peter:
 Oh, it's just a place where homeless people come to shave and go BM. Let's go inside.

Chris:
 Look, Dad! I found this book on our genealogy!

Peter:
 Way to go, son! Hey, look. Here's a picture of your great-great-granddad, Osias Griffin. He owned one of the first dozen telephones.

Osias Griffin:
 Hello?

Caller:
 Hello, Jonathan?

Osias Griffin:
 No, what number are you calling?

Caller:
 Seven.

Osias Griffin:
 No. This is three.

Caller:
 Ooh, sorry.

Peter:
 And his great-grandpa was Thomas Griffin, a great philosopher.

Wife:
 Thomas, would you please go look for a job?

Thomas Griffin:
 Why?

Chris:
 Wow, that's cool! Go back even further, Dad.

Peter:
 Okay. Settle down, spaz. In 1840, Nathaniel "Nate" Griffin used to groom horses. What the hell? Holy crap! I'm black!

Peter:
 But I can't be black.

Lois:
 I gotta say, Peter, the man in this book does look an awful lot like you.

Brian:
 <reading aloud> "The diary of Nate Griffin." "May 7, 1836. I was brushing down Lucy, the new colt, when she let out a fart right near my face. So I took her head and stuck it by my butt and blew a huge fart right back at her."

Brian:
 Ooh, that laugh's in here, too. See? [imitates Peter's laugh]

Peter:
 Wow. Then it's true.

Chris:
 Cool! I get to be black and Irish!

Meg:
 Yeah, and now I can wear clothes that actually show off my big butt!

Lois:
 Oh! I gotta tell Bonnie I'm sleeping with a black man!

Cheerleader:
 Oh, my God! Update! Exclam! Scott Martin just asked me out again!

Stewie:
 I think that would be a bad idea, and I know something about bad ideas.

Stewie:
 I'm telling you, Juice. She's screwing around behind your back. And, if I were in your Bruno Maglis, I wouldn't stand for it. Another mai tai? Thanks. So, listen...

Stewie:
 Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

All:
 [giggling]

Stewie:
 I have yet to discover the secret of their mind-control powers. Also, trying to comprehend their obsession with the homosexuals from 'NSYNC.

Peter:
 Hey, Cleveland, you got a minute? I really need to talk to you.

Cleveland:
 Sure. I was just going for a ride. Hop on.

Peter:
 So, I found out I have a black ancestor.

Cleveland:
 Is that right? Well, that's fantastic, Peter.

Peter:
 Yeah, but see, the problem is I got no idea how to be black...except for not smiling when I get my picture taken.

Cleveland:
 Well, Peter. It sounds like you should go out and mingle amongst your newly-found brethren. You know, absorb the culture. Wheelie time!

Peter:
 You know, you're right, Cleveland. I should be hanging around more black people like myself. Thanks.

Cleveland:
 Hey! Peter, what the...

Peter:
 It's the vibration.

Black Comedian:
 Who here used to wear a lot of Jheri Curl? Yeah, that's right. Y'all know that Exxon Valdez thing? That ain't how it happened. Some brother just fell in the ocean.

Peter:
 God! I remember that. And all those seals died. It was all over the news. The Channel 2 news with Dan Rather. Although, I think Connie Chung might have been substituting for him. Well, 'bout time for me to be hitting the ol' dusty trail. I like your hat. Can't get out that way. [Alarm rings] Found the emergency exit.

Professor:
 1967 was the same year that Thurgood Marshall was named to the Supreme Court of the United States.

Peter:
 [Whooping] Well, I should probably be saddling up now. [Alarm rings] Oh, found the fire door.

Stewie:
 Look at how fat you are. You disgust me! Oink oink, fatty! Oh, yes, yes, you'll take butter on that English muffin, won't you? Because you're the cheerleading squad's token blimp. You don't deserve to eat. [Vomits]

Peter:
 Hey, thanks for bringing me here, Cleveland.

Man:
 Welcome. For our first order of business I believe brother Cleveland has an announcement.

Cleveland:
 Yesterday, I received reparations from the family that enslaved my ancestors.

Crowd:
 Amen! Right on!

Cleveland:
 Now, the family has become poor white trash since then. So they only gave what they could-this tray of scrumptious Rice Krispie Treats. I share them with all of you in the hopes that one day your wounds may be healed as well.

Crowd:
 Amen. Right on.

Man:
 Why is he taking one?

Cleveland:
 Oh, this is my friend, Peter Griffin. He recently discovered he was black.

Peter:
 Gentlemen, please, please. Judge me not by the color of my skin. For I have always been there with you. I was there when George and Weezy moved on up to the East Side. Oh, hallelujah! Those were happy times! But, I was also there for the bad times. When Florida lost James to that tragic auto accident. And I was there when Tootie got those terribly painful braces! Oh, yes! And when Arnold Jackson got beat up by the Gooch, I was there. So before you decide that I don't belong here, remember this-I was there!

Cosby Kid:
 Way to go, Peter! You tell it like it is!

Carter:
 Now, Chris, this one's for you. What's the secret to happiness?

Chris:
 Money!

Carter:
 Very good. Babs, give him a caramel.

Peter:
 Hey hey hey. Hey, Lois, what are your parents doing here?

Lois:
 Oh, they surprised us with a visit after I told them about your recent discovery.

Barbara:
 Yes. Peter, we hear you're a Negro now.

Peter:
 Yep. I even got my own posse. Hey, Big Dog, T-Bone, Shades, you guys go make yourself some sandwiches. We'll hook up later.

Carter:
 My jacket's in the kitchen; please don't write on it. Well, I think Chris and Meg should know the Pewterschmidt side of their ancestry, too. Kids, did you know the Pewterschmidts were among the first to colonize America?

Peter:
 Now, kids, don't be taken in by The Man. Stay black and proud.

Carter:
 Here's your ancestor Silas Pewterschmidt bartering with some local Indians.

Chris:
 Cool.

Carter:
 And here's a picture of...oh, never mind that one.

Peter:
 Wait. What was that?

Carter:
 Oh, that was nothing. Just some fellow we fed and took care of in exchange for doing a few chores.

Peter:
 You mean a slave! Let me see that! Oh, my God! It's Nate Griffin!

Carter:
 Well, 'bout time for me to be hitting the ol' dusty trail.

Peter:
 Lois, your family owned my family!

Lois:
 Daddy, is that true?

Carter:
 Well, it appears so. Boy, this is pretty embarrassing!

Peter:
 Yes, it is! And don't call me boy!

Barbara:
 Peter, please calm down.

Carter:
 Babs, I think it's time we went to bed. Things will look better in the morning. Come here, kids. Give Grandma and Grandpa a kiss goodnight.

Peter:
 You can whip me all you like, white devil, but you'll never break my spirit!

Stewie:
 Damn! There must be some clue to the source of their mental-manipulation techniques. <reading aloud> "Your Body and You." "Every four weeks for three to four days it's entirely normal for every young woman to..." Oh, my God! That's the most disgusting thing I've ever heard in my life! Ugh!

Cindi:
 That totally sucked. You guys call yourselves cheerleaders? Well, I call you cheer-losers!

Stewie:
 This Cindi is definitely the alpha of the group.

Cindi:
 And what happened with the pyramid? I almost broke my neck!

Stewie:
 The pyramid! Of course! That must be the key to their power! Mission objective: Eliminate Cindi and take her place at the top of the pyramid. They're getting nude. No, I mustn't watch. It's not the proper thing to...I say! Nice ones, Jeanine. And look at Lisa in all of her curvaceous glory. Heavens, it appears my wee-wee has been stricken with rigor mortis.

Peter:
 Good morning.

Lois:
 Peter, what on earth are you wearing?

Peter:
 It's a dashiki. And don't call me Peter. That's my slave name. From now on, call me Kichwa Tembo.

Chris:
 Cool. And I'll be Mambutu O'Malley!

Carter:
 Peter...

Peter:
 Kichwa!

Carter:
 I'd like to have a word with you. Peter, I think...

Carter:
 Kichwa, we're both sensible men. There must be something I can do to make things right with you.

Peter:
 Actually, there is. I want reparations just like Cleveland got.

Carter:
 What the hell are you talking about?

Peter:
 I want an apology and some Rice Krispie Treats.

Carter:
 Well, I absolutely will not give you an apology and I'm assuming "Rice Krispie Treats" is black slang for money. So, here's $10,000. I expect you never to mention this ugly business again.

Peter:
 $10,000?

Carter:
 Not enough? Fine. Make it $20,000. How do you spell Kichwa?

Peter:
 Yeah, you know what? Screw the Kichwa. Make it out to Peter. P-E-T-E...

Tom Tucker:
 This just in. Slave-owner descendent, Carter Pewterschmidt has paid $20,000-or 2,000,000 pennies-in reparations to a local black man. We now go live to the local black man.

Peter:
 Well, the money helps but I'll always feel my ancestors' pain. Hey, from down there does it look like I'm talking into a bunch of robot penises?

Peter:
 Hey, Lois, come in here and see what I did with the money your dad gave me.

Lois:
 Oh, my God! You turned the den into Pee-Wee's Playhouse?

Peter:
 ? C'mon get up! ? ? Knock off your nappin' ? ? It's a crazy messed up place where anything can happen ? ? There's a chair that freakin' talks, hey look! ? ? There's some fish that give advice, holy crap! ? ? It's screwy in Peter's Playhouse! ?

Peter:
 Wait. Watch this, watch this. Hey, Jambi! Okay, say it.

Brian:
 Mekka-lekka-hi, mekka-hiney... God, I hate you so much.

Lois:
 Peter, that reparation money should be going to a worthy black charity.

Peter:
 Lois, the King of Cartoons will be here in five minutes and I will not have you embarrass me.

Lois:
 You're acting ridiculous!

Peter:
 Aah! You said the secret word!

Cop:
 Hey, you're that black guy I saw on the news conference, ain't you?

Peter:
 Uh, yeah, that's me.

Cop:
 This is Car 15; I'm gonna need backup. I got a stolen vehicle here.

Peter:
 But this is my car.

Cop:
 Suspect's getting belligerent.

Police Officer:
 Officer down.

Man:
 So, it's agreed. We'll keep on pretending to like pig's feet simply to confound the white man.

Peter:
 Sorry I'm late, you guys. The white man was making me his bitch. What? Oh, oh, sorry, his "biatch."

Cleveland:
 Peter, we know about your selfish squandering of your reparation money. I shared mine. You, however, have given nothing back to the community.

Peter:
 That's not true. I've brought you the greatest gift of all. A child's laughter. [Laughing]

Cleveland:
 Peter, I think you should go.

Peter:
 Yeah, I'm going.

Peter:
 Hi, guys. Hey, how's it going? Jeez, Lois, no one wants to sit with me. It's like I'm a freakin' leper. Hey, can we sit there?

Leper:
 No, these are saved.

Cheerleader:
 Where is Cindi?

Stewie:
 You know, Cindi, I'd feel worse about this if you didn't spell your name with that insufferable "i" at the end. And that cockadoodie smiley face you use to dot it! You sicken me! I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not gonna hurt you.

Peter:
 [yells]

Nate Griffin:
 Hello, Peter.

Peter:
 Nate Griffin! Oh, my God! You're haunting me because I've been a terrible black man!

Nate Griffin:
 Peter, you gotta stop putting so much importance on race. I know I didn't.

Peter:
 You didn't?

Nate Griffin:
 No. If I had, would I have slept with your white great-great-great-great granny?

Peter:
 No, I guess not.

Nate Griffin:
 That's right, and I wouldn't have slept with her fine sister neither. You see, the most important thing is how a man acts. You know what I'm getting at?

Peter:
 You think I should do something good with that reparation money.

Nate Griffin:
 That'd be mighty fine, Peter.

Peter:
 I guess you're right. Listen, for what it's worth, I'm sorry my wife's ancestors made you suffer.

Nate Griffin:
 Oh, don't worry about me. If it makes you feel any better, I peed in their cereal every morning. Well, so long, Peter.

Peter:
 Wait! Before you go-what's Heaven like?

Nate Griffin:
 It's fine. There's a shortage of chairs.

Nate Griffin:
 Yeah. Take it easy, Peter.

Cheerleader:
 Okay, well, we're just gonna have to go on without her.

Stewie:
 Give me a "D!"

All:
 "D!"

Stewie:
 All right, that's enough of that. Now, there's a large hunting knife under each one of your seats. On my command, I want you to.... You idiots! I had them! Cindi was right. We need a lot more work.

Peter:
 Excuse me. Hi, I'm Peter Griffin. Listen, as many of you may know, I recently came into some money. Well, I don't really deserve it so I've decided to share it with my brothers!

Peter:
 Actually, I just meant the black guys.

Lois:
 Peter, that was very generous. Look how happy you've made everyone.

Peter:
 Yeah, it just goes to show you, Lois. It doesn't matter if you're black or white. The only color that really matters is green.

Lois:
 Oh, Peter.

Cheerleader:
 I wonder what happened to Cindi.

Quagmire:
 Dear diary, Jackpot!

Tom Tucker:
 ...Alan Adler, David Preslack, Julie Axlerod, Shep Sutton, Scott McCormack. And that concludes the list of people who were mean to me in junior high. Tomorrow, high school. Finally, we go to Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa for 60 seconds of filler.

Tricia Takanawa:
 Thanks, Tom. I'm here on Spooner Street where several Quahog families are holding a car wash to raise money for an organ transplant for young Paul Lewis. So, what do you call this device, Paul?

Paul:
 It's an iron lung. It keeps me from dying. I want to play baseball!

Tricia Takanawa:
 And with me is one of Paul's classmates, Chris Griffin, who helped organize this charity event. You're a very thoughtful young man, Chris.

Chris:
 Can I say hello to my mom?

Tricia Takanawa:
 Sure.

Lois:
 Hi, sweetheart!

Stewie:
 Okay, so, you want the full wash and, uh...oh, you've got a nick there. I can probably get that out for you. Now, if you want to go with a scent, I've got PB & J, Sugar Cereal, and New Toy. What the deuce?

Chris:
 Hey, somebody dropped a money clip.

Meg:
 Wow! $26.

Chris:
 I've never seen so much money at one time!

Meg:
 What do you think should we do with it?

Stewie:
 I say we buy $26 worth of ice cream and just pig out. Oh, We can dish, talk about who's getting fat. Oh, we'll just be great big bitches.

Joe:
 Hold on, kids. That's not your money yet. The law says you gotta put up signs and wait two weeks for someone to claim it. If no one does, it's yours. Ah, lunch is here.

Lois:
 Everyone, we've reached our goal! It looks like somebody's gonna live to see puberty.

Brian:
 My God! That man just took our money!

Joe:
 What man?

Lois:
 He was wearing a Jimmy Carter mask like that robber in that Keanu Reeves movie.

Joe:
 The Matrix?

Lois:
 No, no, no. It wasn't that recent. It was the one where they were jumping out of a plane...

Joe:
 Executive Decision?

Lois:
 No, that was with Kurt Russell. But the other guy in this movie, he kind of looks Kurt Russell...

Meg:
 He's getting away!

Joe:
 Don't worry. He won't get far.

Joe:
 Stop! Police!

Joe:
 [Gasping for breath]

Peter:
 Joe, what happened?

Joe:
 I got the money.

Peter:
 All right, Joe!

Joe:
 But I lost the perp.

Lois:
 Well, the money's the important thing. Now little Paul can get his...Point Break! That was the movie!

Cleveland:
 Here's to Joe, who helped little Paul get a new liver and, barring a massive infection, a new lease on life.

Joe:
 Don't you understand? I lost the perp! I lost the perp! [Sobbing] [Screaming]

Meg:
 So, um, the $26 would probably be safe in my room.

Stewie:
 Right. It'd probably get lost among the pinups of Justin Timberlake, and Tom Cruise, and.... Blast! Who the devil do the teenagers like? Morgan Freeman.

Chris:
 Well, we can't keep it in my room because there's an evil monkey that lives in my closet. You know, the sad part is, he wasn't always evil.

Evil Monkey:
 Honey, good news! I made partner! [Angry shrieking]

Lois:
 Peter, Bonnie says Joe's been really depressed about that robbery. Why don't you go talk to him?

Peter:
 I don't know. There's a game on.

Angel Peter:
 Shame on you! You march right over there, and cheer your old friend up!

Devil Peter:
 Don't listen to that sissy. Grab a beer and watch the game.

Peter:
 Yeah. That sounds good. Oh, my God!

Angel Peter:
 Now, get your fat ass over to Joe's!

Peter:
 Look, buddy, I...

Angel Peter:
 Move!

Peter:
 All right. Just take it easy, just take it easy, man. Everything's cool. Hey, buddy.

Joe:
 Close the door! I don't want to see the light.

Peter:
 Come on, Joe. Cheer up, huh? Hey, what do you say you and me go roller-skate...bike ride...jump rope...go lay on the grass?

Joe:
 Peter, the other day was the first time I've ever lost a perp. It was also the first time I've ever really felt handicapped. I've made up my mind about this. I'm quitting the force.

Peter:
 Oh, come on, Joe. You don't have to quit the force. I mean, you could get a desk job. You could be a desk.

Joe:
 Forget it! I'm washed up.

Tom Tucker:
 In local news, Quahog will soon play proud host to the Special People's Games. If you and/or a friend are disabled and would like to challenge yourself and raise your self-esteem, sign up today!

Peter:
 Joe, that's it! You got to compete in the Special People's Games.

Joe:
 Gosh! I-I don't know, Peter. Do you really think I can?

Peter:
 Hey, I'm the guy that believed you could be a desk. Come on! I'll even be your coach!

Joe:
 All right! Let's do it!

Tom Tucker:
 Coming up in this half hour, our undercover expose on conveniently placed news reports in television shows. But first, Peter, look out for that skateboard.

Finneous:
 Had a bit of a row with a fellow in the steam room.

Barnaby:
 You don't say!

Finneous:
 Gave him a cauliflower ear.

Barnaby:
 Bully!

Peter:
 Come on! Come on! Two more.

Joe:
 Peter, you're pushing me too hard.

Peter:
 Trust me, Joe. I know physical fitness. I was in Richard Simmons' Sweatin' to Books on Tape.

Mitch Albom:
 The Red Sox were in town. But I didn't care because it was Tuesday, and I was on my way to see Morrie. He couldn't go to the bathroom by himself anymore. But his indomitable spirit...

Peter:
 So, how does he check out, Doc? Is my boy ready to compete?

 Hartman:
 Um, I don't quite know how to tell you this, Mr. Swanson. You're paralyzed from the waist down.

Joe:
 I know.

 Hartman:
 Oh, thank God! Oh, God, I was standing out there for, like, 10 minutes! Boy, is that a load off!

Peter:
 Mort, Joe here's gonna be competing in the Special People's Games. You got anything that might give him extra juice?

Mort:
 You mean steroids? But, Peter, haven't you seen what happens to those ladies on ESPN2? They get big hair faces, and their breasts become like flapjacks!

Peter:
 I was thinking more like a protein shake.

Mort:
 Oh, God, I'm sorry! Aisle 3, next to the creams. Ooh, I don't like saying that word.

Announcer:
 We now return to Touched by an Angel.

Lawyer:
 Now, where exactly did the angel touch you?

Boy:
 Here.

Angel:
 Oh, come on! Who're you gonna believe? I got a freakin' halo!

Meg:
 'Bye! I'm going to the mall!

Chris:
 What are you going to the mall for?

Meg:
 Don't worry. The $26 is safe.

Stewie:
 Safe, huh? The skirt's trying to pull a fast one. Knuckles, get the handbag!

Chris:
 Right, boss!

Meg:
 Hey! Give me my purse, you psycho!

Stewie:
 Let's see. Makeup, chewing gum, a picture of Meg in a two-piece swimsuit. Oh, God! I pray this is not my first memory!

Brian:
 Look, everybody cool it! I am not going to put up with this racket for two weeks. I'll hold onto the money. I'm a neutral party, so it'll be safe.

Meg:
 All right.

Stewie:
 I suppose we can trust you.

Meg:
 Now, where is it?

Stewie:
 What the...oh, very clever. Take another reach. You forgot your change.

Tom Tucker:
 Hello, and welcome to the Quahog Special People's Games. I'm Tom Tucker.

Diane Simmons:
 And I'm Diane Simmons. It's a great day to be alive, Tom, able-bodied or not.

Tom Tucker:
 It sure is, Diane. Today we'll see some of Quahog's finest athletes struggle valiantly against God's twisted designs. You'll cheer, you'll cry, you might even get a cheap laugh or two.

Diane Simmons:
 I know I will, Tom. In fact, there's the distinct possibility that, by the end of the day, we'll all be going to Hell.

Tom Tucker:
 I'll see you there, Diane.

Diane Simmons:
 Oh, it sounds like the opening ceremonies have begun. There are the paraplegics. Followed by the blind team.

Tom Tucker:
 Still no sign of the deaf team, I notice.

Diane Simmons:
 And now, we turn our attention to the lighting of the flame.

Tom Tucker:
 And these games are underway! We begin with the 100-meter dash for people afraid of yellow tape.

Diane Simmons:
 It's anybody's race now, Tom!

Tom Tucker:
 And it's Odai Mutambo of Kenya!

Joe:
 The decathlon. I don't know. That's quite a mountain to climb, Peter.

Peter:
 Joe, look at me! Look at me! Do I have food in my teeth?

Joe:
 No.

Peter:
 Oh, great. Thank God! Now, listen here, Joe. You and I both know you have what it takes to win this thing. So, get out there and do it, huh?

Disabled Ass:
 That gold medal is mine, pretty boy. You don't have a chance in Hell.

Joe:
 He may be right, Peter.

Peter:
 Joe, he's an android. Don't let him push you around. You can do this. I know you can.

Joe:
 Yeah. Yeah! Hey, you think you're so hot, fella? Well, at least I can do this. [Sings arpeggio]

Disabled Ass:
 [Sings monotone] Oh, crap!

Tom Tucker:
 Let's go to the first decathlon event of the day, the pole vault, where Joe Swanson takes his starting position.

Peter:
 Yeah! Way to go, Joe!

Joe:
 Yeah! How do you like that, buddy?

Disabled Ass:
 A sphincter says what?

Disabled Ass:
 Ha-ha-ha-ha. You stupid bastard.

Stewie:
 Good to see your new fiscal responsibilities haven't interfered with your reading. Ah, Dostoyevsky-the Mad Russian. Good stuff, good stuff.

Brian:
 You're not gonna get the $26, and you're despicable for trying.

Stewie:
 Oh, you thought.... I wasn't trying to get the $26. I thought we were just having a perfectly innocent conversation about literature. Oh, you're silly. You're silly. I love that you'd go there. You're silly. Good-bye.

Tom Tucker:
 We'll take you to bulimic pie-eating in just a moment. But first, decathlon front-runner Joe Swanson, will attempt the long jump.

Peter:
 Come on, Joe! Break a wheel!

Joe:
 I'm ready. Let's get it on!

Tom Tucker:
 Ooh, short jump. That'll knock him out of the lead. Tough break.

Diane Simmons:
 Tough break it is, Tom.

Tom Tucker:
 Good contribution, Diane. If Swanson expects to take the gold he's going to have to come in first in the final event, the 100-meter dash.

Peter:
 That's okay, Joe. You can still win this thing.

Disabled Ass:
 That was pathetic. Tell your wife to come over to my place if she wants a little boom-shacka-lacka-lacka-lacka boom-shaka-lacka-lacka-lacka boom-shaka-lacka-lacka-lacka boom.

Joe:
 Peter, it's over.

Peter:
 Over? What are you talking about?

Joe:
 If I couldn't catch a two-bit criminal, how am I supposed to win a race?

Peter:
 Hey, what kind of talk is that? It's un-American! Did George W. Bush quit even after losing the popular vote? No! Did he quit after losing millions of dollars of his father's friends' money in failed oil companies? No! Did he quit after knocking that girl up? No! Did he quit after he got that DUI? No! Did he quit gettin' arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct at a football game? No! Did he quit...

Joe:
 I get the message, Peter.

Mort:
 ? And I carry it with me like my daddy did ? ? If you're goin my way, I'll go with you. ? ? Movin' me down the highway ?

Joe:
 Gee, Peter! This water tastes kinda funny.

Peter:
 You mean like ha-ha, Jerry Seinfeld funny or Elayne Boosler, "God bless her, she's trying" funny?

Referee:
 Racers, on your mark!

Peter:
 Go get 'em, Joe!

Referee:
 Get set!

Peter:
 Yeah!

Tom Tucker:
 And Joe Swanson wins the gold medal!

Peter:
 You did it, Joe!

Joe:
 We did it, Peter!

Child:
 Mommy, look at the ladybu-aaah!

Jim Kaplan:
 Hey, Greased Lightnin'!

Joe:
 Do I know you?

Jim Kaplan:
 Jim Kaplan, sports agent. You like this car?

Joe:
 Yeah.

Jim Kaplan:
 It's yours. You like my pants?

Joe:
 Uh, sure.

Jim Kaplan:
 They're yours! You know what a merkin is?

Jim Kaplan:
 Pubic wig. I got one. You want it?

Joe:
 No!

Jim Kaplan:
 Course, you don't, you're a classy guy! You want to be rich?

Joe:
 Yes!

Jim Kaplan:
 Sign here.

Peter:
 What the hell? I just don't understand how he could do that without me. We were gonna do everything together!

Brian:
 It was one cereal ad, Peter. Besides, he's the one who won the medal.

Peter:
 Yeah, I guess.

Announcer:
 Coming to ABC, the simple story of a man and his chair. Rolling Courage: the Joe Swanson Story.

Announcer:
 Starring Tony Danza as Joe Swanson. Once a man at his physical peak, brought down by a cruel twist of fate.

Tony Danza:
 Why?

Announcer:
 With Valerie Bertinelli as Bonnie.

Valerie Bertinelli:
 Joe, you've got to accept your limitations.

Tony Danza:
 Why don't you just ask me to lay down and die?

Valerie Bertinelli:
 I can't live like this anymore!

Tony Danza:
 That's it!

Peter:
 That's not how it happened! It was my idea!

Announcer:
 With Bea Arthur as Peter Griffin.

Bea Arthur:
 You'll never make it, Joe! Why don't you just give up right now?

Tony Danza:
 No. I've got to try! Even if it's by myself.

Bea Arthur:
 You're a fool, Joe! A fool!

Announcer:
 Rolling Courage: The Joe Swanson Story. Friday on ABC, followed by Dharma and Greg-but you don't have to watch that.

Peter:
 I don't believe this. Joe wouldn't be famous if it hadn't been for me. How come he's getting all the glory?

Brian:
 He's handicapped. That's what makes his story so inspirational.

Peter:
 Handicapped...hmmm. Aaah! How did these get up here?

Chris:
 What the hell is this, Brian?

Brian:
 It's my new passport. What are you doing going through my mail?

Meg:
 You weren't planning on going somewhere with our $26, were you?

Brian:
 Oh, for God's sake! I just had the damn thing renewed! What's the matter with you?

Stewie:
 You're obviously taking us for saps. But we're not. Now, fess up, or I'll do to you what I did to John Lennon.

Stewie:
 John, have you met Yoko? Yoko, John?

Brian:
 You want your money? Fine! I hope you all kill each other.

Stewie:
 All right, I know how to settle this. Whoever wants the money raise your hand! Ho, ho, you're smarter than I thought. Give yourselves a round of applause. Damn!

Tom Tucker:
 Yeah, honey, I'm gonna be late tonight. I've got a hooker coming over. Well, I know it's late notice, but what about the pool guy? He likes you.

Intern:
 Mr. Tucker, Mr. Griffin's here to see you.

Tom Tucker:
 I got to go.

Peter:
 Mr. Tucker, I have just become handicapped like Joe Swanson. And I demand commercial endorsements and a TV movie based on me, starring Valerie Bertandernie.

Tom Tucker:
 But, Mr. Griffin...

Peter:
 I even got the first piece you're gonna run-exclusive video footage of my tragic accident. "Oh, no! A car going too fast to stop in time! Aaeeee! I'm handicapped now! Ah!"

Tom Tucker:
 Mr. Griffin, you can't possibly expect me to believe this. That was clearly a scarecrow dressed in your clothes.

Peter:
 Oh, come on!

Tom Tucker:
 And when I freeze-frame...that's you driving the car.

Peter:
 Well, there's your hook!

Tom Tucker:
 Get out.

Mayor West:
 Today we're here to honor Joe Swanson for pulling my poor one-eyed cat, Bootsie, out of the old stove pipe of my grandmother's cabin. Joe Swanson won the Special People's Decathlon, and we're here to honor him.

Peter:
 Backstabber.

Lois:
 Oh, Peter, I'm sure Joe's gonna acknowledge you. You'll see.

Peter:
 Don't forget our deal, Lois. I sit through this, and later tonight I get anal. You hear me? No matter how neat I want the house, you have to clean it.

Joe:
 Thank you, thank you. You know, no one can win a gold medal by himself. It takes friends. And I want to acknowledge a special friend in the audience today. My friend Peter...Peter Yarrow of Peter, Paul and Mary! Let's give him a hand, folks. But that's nothing compared to what this next man did. He challenged me to go that extra mile. And that man is Mr. Griffin...Comedian Eddie Griffin, get up here! Your acerbic anti-white humor was a constant inspiration, thank you, sir. And last but not least, who could forget the fat guy? Chef Paul Prudhomme! You get your Cajun ass up here!

Paul Prudhomme:
 Why? I didn't even do anything!

Peter:
 That's it! Excuse me, but there's someone else he didn't thank! Mr. Steroid! That's how he won!

Joe:
 That's not true!

Peter:
 Yes, it is. I put steroids in your water bottle right before the last race.

Joe:
 I'm sorry, everybody. I've let you all down.

Disabled Ass:
 Yes. You suck. I rule. Who da man? Who da man? Who da man?

Meg:
 All right. If anyone tries to lift the glass, the bell will ring.

Chris:
 Well then, let's all go to bed.

Stewie:
 Off we go then.

Meg:
 Stop!

Brian:
 Did you find the place okay?

 Taylor:
 No problem.

Brian:
 Hey, kids!

Stewie:
 I only had soup. I don't see why we should split the bill evenly.

Brian:
 Wake up! This is Mr. Taylor. He's here for the money clip.

Meg:
 Oh!

Stewie:
 [a la Charlie Brown] Aauughh!

Lois:
 Peter, you should go talk to him. After all, you set out to make him feel better, and now he's worse than ever.

Peter:
 I don't know, Lois. He's probably waiting to be interviewed by Dan Rather or that dreadful Gene Shalit.

Lois:
 I think those days are over now, Peter.

Peter:
 Uh, hey there.

Joe:
 Uh, hi, Peter.

Peter:
 Listen, Joe, about this whole mess...

Joe:
 Hold it, Peter! That's the car-wash thief!

 Taylor:
 A-ha! Tough luck, wheelie!

Joe:
 Yeah, for you! I'm Joe, your waiter. Today's special is justice, served cold, with a side of jail! And order the souffle now, 'cause it takes 10 to 15 years!

Joe:
 Hey, Peter, I really appreciate what you did for me.

Peter:
 What do you mean?

Joe:
 Well, that slimy agent had me believing the hype. I forgot it was really you who got me to believe in myself again. Oh, and by the way, I'm going back to the force.

Peter:
 Good for you. Hey, what happened to the car-wash thief?

Joe:
 Ironically, I severed his spine when I landed on him.

Peter:
 Looks like you got more competition at next year's games, huh?

Joe:
 Nope, he's dead.

Chris:
 Merry Christmas, dude. Don't put it in your nose. It burns like hell.

Cleveland:
 Merry Christmas, everybody. As president of the Quahog Chamber of Commerce, I'd like to thank the Seniors' Center for decorating our tree.

Senior:
 Oop, broke my hip!

Lois:
 Look, honey. There's the manger for the Christmas pageant. You're gonna make the cutest baby Jesus ever.

Stewie:
 So, you want to dress me up and trot me about like a circus poodle, hmm? Here, let me consult my agent, Mr. Irving R. Pointy Stick!

Lois:
 Oh, Stewie, no sweets before dinner.

Meg:
 Mom, I'm freezing. Can we go home?

Lois:
 In a minute. Would you just look at this beautiful tree? Every year I look up at that star and I think of all of the joy and wonder that Christmas promises. And that miracle that occurred on that silent winter's night.

Peter:
 Hey, I'm on vacation! Happy birthday, Jesus! ? Seven maids a-milking, six maids a-milking, five maids a-milk... ?

Brian:
 Uh, well, it's a little warm in here, you know?

Lois:
 "Don we now our gay apparel"

Brian:
 Doesn't get much gayer than this.

Lois:
 Peter, tomorrow's Christmas Eve and you still haven't gotten us a tree.

Peter:
 Lois, I told you I'm on dipsaluscious vacation. What part of that don't you understand?

Lois:
 Come on, honey. It's the only thing I've asked you to do. Please?

Peter:
 Brian, tape this for me.

Brian:
 Sorry. The VCR hasn't worked since you tried to tape Monday Night Football.

FBI Agent:
 Do you have the express written consent of ABC Sports and the National Football League?

Peter:
 Just ABC.

Lois:
 Well, if you get us a tree, I'll make sure Santa brings you a new VCR. Please?

Peter:
 Oh, crap. How come I...commercial! [Chopping tree]

Meg:
 Hey, Mom, I got something to add to my Christmas list. A pair of those jeweled bug barrettes. Not costume, real. Maybe you should write that down?

Lois:
 Santa got all his shopping done before the rush. I think you'll be very happy.

Chris:
 I just want peace on Earth. That's better than being selfish like Meg, right? So I should get more than her.

Peter:
 Here's the tree. Merry Christmas to all and to all shut the hell up.

Lois:
 Uh-uh-uh, before you sit down, we're due at Joe and Bonnie's for eggnog.

Peter:
 Lois, can't we tell them that your mother died?

Peter:
 All right, all right, I'll kill your mother. God, when did Christmas become so complicated?

Peter:
 So, uh, you guys know that Rudolph is on, right?

Bonnie:
 Thank you for the lovely gingerbread house, Lois.

Joe:
 Oh, yeah! It's perfect for all the happy, active gingerbread men. Except for the one with no legs! Look at the parents telling their kids not to stare. "How does his pee-pee work, Mommy?" Well, I've got news for you, Becky. Not so well!

Bonnie:
 Joe, you promised. It's Christmas. Joe had his accident at Christmas time.

Lois:
 [Nervous laughter]

Carolers:
 "Check the balls on Uncle Charlie"

Peter:
 Yes! Time to go a-wassailing!

Quagmire:
 Hey, Peter.

Cleveland:
 Hi. I'm Prancer.

Lois:
 Hey, why don't you take Joe along?

Peter:
 Yeah, Lois. That'll be about as much fun as a lecture on ontological empiricism.

Lois:
 Honey, he could use some Christmas spirit. For me? Please?

Peter:
 All right. But you owe me later, under the mistletoe. Open mouth, no matter how drunk I am.

Lois:
 Peter, the gifts are hidden in the trunk. Don't forget to drop off the one for Toys for Toddlers.

Peter:
 All right, all right. Hey, somebody give me a beer.

Quagmire:
 Heads up.

Joe:
 Yeah, Peter, one of us has to be the designated driver. And I've already had four eggnogs. So I guess you're it.

Peter:
 That's a good one, Joe. Way to get into the spirit.

Joe:
 I'm a cop first and a buddy second. So don't think I wouldn't throw your drunk-driving ass in the slammer! All right, let's a-wassail!

Lois:
 Stewie, honey, time for bed. You have a big day tomorrow, baby Jesus.

Stewie:
 Trust me, woman, if I could walk on water, I would stroll you out to the middle of a lake and hold your head under until the bubbles stopped!

Lois:
 Someone's being naughty, not nice. You know, Santa's watching you.

Stewie:
 What the devil do you mean, "watching"?

Lois:
 Well, honey, Santa's making a list and checking it twice.

Meg:
 He sees you when you're sleeping.

Chris:
 And he knows when you're awake. I almost caught him last year. But he's magic!

Stewie:
 Constant surveillance of every child on Earth? Impossible! Unless...hidden cameras. Oh, very clever. Watching to see if I'm naughty, are you? Well, check this twice!

 Cleveland:
 ? Rock the boat ?

Cleveland:
 ? Don't rock the boat, baby ?

Cleveland:
 ? Don't tip the boat over ?

 Cleveland:
 ? Rock the boat! ?

Joe:
 Rock on!

Quagmire:
 Hey, guys. Check me out! Whoa!

Joe:
 [Grunting] [Screaming] Oh, no! I've broken my legs!

Peter:
 That's about as funny as Sinbad. Not the comedian, he's hilarious-the sailor. But then again, he was never meant to be funny. Now come on. I gotta go to freakin' Toys for Toddlers.

Cleveland:
 Sounds like somebody's got a humbug up his butt.

Quagmire:
 Maybe we should set him up with another lemon snow cone, eh?

Peter:
 No, thanks. The last one you gave me didn't taste like lemon at all! It tasted like...oh, you guys are asses!

Santa:
 I knew you were awake.

Stewie:
 You!

Santa:
 Now, Stewie, you are in my power.

Stewie:
 No, damn you! Damn you, let me go!

Santa:
 Good, Melvin. Nice work, Woodrow. Excellent, Stewie.

Stewie:
 Aah! It was just a dream. I needn't fear this Santa. If he were truly omnipotent, he'd have the testicular fortitude to show himself! See? I'm just barking at the dark. No one here but me. [nervously humming] All right, where is it? Where's the wire? Show yourself, Claus!

Lois:
 Stewie, go to sleep!

Stewie:
 This doesn't involve you, Lois!

Lois:
 I don't want to have to come in there.

Stewie:
 I don't want to have to come in there!

Meg:
 Sh. Dad's awake.

Peter:
 Don't bother whispering. I don't have a hangover.

Brian:
 It's a Christmas miracle!

Peter:
 Shouldn't you have your sweater on?

Lois:
 [kiss] That's for letting Joe join in your reindeer games. Now you go relax while I make my little Christmas angel a big stack of pancakes.

Peter:
 If I'm sleeping, just stuff 'em in my mouth and rub my throat.

Lois:
 Just one more thing.

Peter:
 Lois!

Lois:
 I need you to take the presents out of the trunk.

Brian:
 Aren't you gonna do it?

Brian:
 All? Peter, only one gift was for charity. The rest were for the family.

Peter:
 No. The rest were "from" the family. Weren't they? Oh, crap. Since when did they change the meaning of "for" to "from"?

Brian:
 I think they had a meeting about it last night.

Brian:
 They sent you a card. But it said "For Peter" on it. So you must've thought it was "from" you, so you didn't...you know, it's just easier to call you stupid.

Brian:
 You're really gonna take back donated gifts on Christmas Eve?

Peter:
 Yep. Now here's the plan. You'll enter through the air conditioning duct here. Now, there'll be an invisible laser grid three inches above the floor. So you'll have to compress your body to the size of a household sponge and slide underneath like some kind of weird amphibious dolphin.

Hick mother:
 What 'choo want?

Hicks:
 [Hollering]

Peter:
 So you understand all these gifts were supposed to be for my family. It was just some crazy mix-up.

Hick Mother:
 Kill 'em.

Hick Father:
 [Pumps shotgun]

Peter:
 No, no, no. It's true. You see, that remote control cow was for my son. And those barrettes were for my daughter. And, uh.... Hey, where's my VCR?

Buck:
 It's my sex box! And her name is "Sony."

Lois:
 You gave away all the presents?

Peter:
 Lois, if you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.

Lois:
 Peter, you brought glad tidings to a family less fortunate than your own.

Peter:
 You mean you're not mad?

Lois:
 Well, I am little irritated that I have to do all the shopping again. But at least some good came out of it.

Peter:
 So I can drink beer and watch TV? 'cause, you know, KISS Saves Santa's on.

Ace Frehley:
 But, Mrs. Claus, who would kidnap Santa?

 Claus:
 Well, Ace, that's what I want you boys to find out.

Gene Simmons:
 Someone stole Santa? That does not rock!

Paul Stanley:
 Easy, Gene. Guys, let's go save Christmas. To the KISS Copter!

KISS:
 [Cheering]

Lois:
 You can watch all the TV you want-[kiss]-just as soon as we get back from the mall.

Peter:
 The mall? On Christmas Eve?

Lois:
 Peter, I just want this family to have a perfect Christmas. And I need a little help, okay? Brian, my turkey's in the oven. Can you turn it off at 3:00?

Brian:
 No problem.

Lois:
 We'll shop, come home, eat, and then it's off to the pageant to see our little Stewie play baby Jesus.

Stewie:
 Oh, yes, yes. By all means, turn me into a child star. Perhaps I can move to Cal-i-for-ni-a and wrangle me a three-way with the Olsen twins.

Lois:
 There's a spot!

Peter:
 Ah, screw this.

Lois:
 Okay, Peter. We'll each take half the list to save time. Kids, why don't you take Stewie to see Santa?

Stewie:
 Santa?

Stewie:
 No, it's not possible! Sitting alone in this public setting? No bullet-proof glass? Claus, you make it too easy. Change me! I've leaked through my ski pants and I won't face him wet!

Announcer:
 We now return to Bob Hope's Christmas with the Troops.

Bob Hope:
 It's good to see you Union boys. I would've been here sooner, but Lincoln gave me the wrong "Gettysburg Address." How about this having to sit still for 60 seconds to have your picture taken? How 'bout that?

Peter:
 Sweet! It's KISS Saves Santa.

Ace Frehley:
 Hang on, Santa. We're coming.

Santa:
 Hurry, boys. The eggs are hatching!

Peter Kriss:
 What do we do?

Paul Stanley:
 Wait a second. Everyone knows pterodactyls can't stand the screech of a guitar!

Gene Simmons:
 It's working!

KISS:
 Hey, Santa, be careful! Oh, no! Hang on, Santa!

Peter:
 Hey, I was watching that! Hey!

Clerk:
 It'll be on next Christmas.

Peter:
 Who the hell knows when that's gonna be?

Brian:
 Ah! If I was an oven mitt...

Brian:
 Damn it, Peter!

Santa:
 Ho, ho, ho. And what can I bring you this year?

Stewie:
 Oh, a peace offering is it? Very well, what say you trim those gin-soaked whiskers and bring me some plutonium?

Santa:
 Well, can you be a good boy?

Stewie:
 Your inquiry intrigues me. Can any of us be a good boy? Are our primal urges innate, or the result of the choices we make?

Santa:
 Okay. Wrap it up, kid.

Stewie:
 All right, Kringle! If the reward is plutonium, then your wager is accepted. I will be "nice."

Santa:
 Good boy! Now smile for the camera.

Stewie:
 Yes, yes. Smile, like a good boy.

Brian:
 Aaaaaah!

Peter:
 Aha, Meg's barrettes.

Old Woman:
 You mean, Julie's barrettes!

Peter:
 You still want 'em, you bony old blue hair? Ow, ow! Tittie twister! Ow, hurts!

Peter:
 Aha! All the clown fish and yellow tangs in the world can't help you now. That's it? Fish food? That's your ace in the hole? Hahaha! Oh, God! Ow, ow, ow!

Brian:
 Turkey!

Brian:
 [Screaming]

Peter:
 Oh, Lois, it was horrible. The fish were jumping all over my eyes and in my nose. And on the way out, I think one of them muttered something anti-Semitic.

Lois:
 We're almost home, honey. Oh, look. There's the star on the town Christmas tree. We're following it home just like the Three Wise Men.

Lois:
 [Gasping] Oh, my God! Brian, are you okay?

Chris:
 I told you we should've left cookies for Santa.

Peter:
 [Hollering] My couch! My TV! What the hell did you do?

Peter:
 I'll tell you who. Someone who cares enough about physical comedy to put his whole family at serious risk.

Lois:
 Boys, please. It's Christmas Eve. This is a night for magic, and wonder, and joy. Okay, so a couple of things have gone wrong. But we can still have a great Christmas.

Peter:
 [Sighing] Aw jeez, kids. You know, I was this close to losing it. But your mom's right.

Lois:
 Well, sure I am. Meg, honey, get me some paper towels. Let's lose the bad tidings, clean up this mess, and find that holiday cheer.

All:
 [Muttering in agreement]

Meg:
 We're out of paper towels.

Lois:
 No paper towels? [Screaming]

Peter:
 Hey, I was gonna pick at that.

Lois:
 Shut your fat mouth! You all think Christmas just happens? You think all this goodwill just falls from the freakin' sky? Well, it doesn't! It falls out of my holly jolly butt! So, you can cook your own damn turkey and wrap your own damn presents! And while you're at it, you can all ride a one-horse open sleigh to hell! [Screaming] [Panting maniacally]

Meg:
 Oh. Here's the paper towels.

George Bailey:
 I-I changed my mind! Clarence, I want to live again! [Screaming]

Frosty the Snowman:
 Hey, I guess there's some magic in that old silk hat.

Lois:
 [snarling]

Frosty the Snowman:
 Merry Christmas!

Lois:
 You want some of this! [Mindless cackling]

Frosty the Snowman:
 Ah! What the hell is her problem?

Frosty the Snowman:
 Just a second, just a second. Hey, lady, you got something to say to me?

Lois:
 Wish? It's easy to wish. But does anyone take responsibility and make it happen? No! You all expect someone else to do it for you like Santy Claus or Mommy!

Frosty the Snowman:
 [Screaming] What the.... Ah! Take it off! Take it off!

Lois:
 Must kill star.

Chris:
 Dad, what happened to Mom? What if she never comes back?

Peter:
 I think the bigger question is if this is the way she's gonna act at Christmas do we even want her back?

Stewie:
 Which is better? Around the waist or off the shoulder? Waist? Shoulder? Waist? Shoulder?

Meg:
 Stewie, I thought you didn't want to be in the pageant.

Stewie:
 Oh, Megan, Santa would think it terribly naughty of me not to fulfill my obligation to Mother. You know how much the pageant means to her.

Chris:
 Where do you think she is?

Peter:
 Well, thank God years ago I planted a homing device in your mother's skull for just such an occasion.

Peter:
 I forgot. I also put 'em in a bunch of squirrels. This isn't goint to do us any good. May as well see if she's at the pageant.

Lois:
 You lied to me.

Meg:
 Oh, my God! There's Mom!

Peter:
 Hi, Lois! Hey, do we look like ants down here?

Lois:
 Bite me!

Joe:
 Peter, great time last night. Don't worry. We'll get Lois down.

Sniper:
 Locked and loaded, sir.

Meg:
 Wait. You can't shoot my mom!

Joe:
 Don't worry, kid. It's just a mild sedative. Go!

Peter:
 All right, hang on. Look, Lois is only up there because we sucked the Christmas spirit right out of her. Maybe if she sees the pageant it'll bring her around. Give her a chance, eh?

Brian:
 Trust him, Joe. This man has seen every Christmas special ever made.

Joe:
 Are you wearing a girl's sweater?

Brian:
 Does that really matter right now?

Joe:
 You got 10 minutes.

Peter:
 Lights, please.

Peter:
 As we all know, Christmas is that mystical time of year when the ghost of Jesus rises from the grave to feed on the flesh of the living. So we all sing Christmas carols to lull him back to sleep.

Bob:
 Outrageous! How dare he say such blasphemy! I've gotta do something!

Man:
 Bob, there's nothing you can do.

Bob:
 [Sighing] Well, I guess I'll just have to develop a sense of humor.

Bonnie:
 I am the Virgin Mary. That's my story and I'm sticking to it. Oh, Our Savior has arrived.

Stewie:
 Good evening. I am playing the role of Jesus. A man once portrayed on the big screen by Jeffrey Hunter. You may remember him as the actor who was replaced by William Shatner on Star Trek. Apparently Mr. Hunter was good enough to die for our sins but not quite up to the task of seducing green women. Anyhoo, the perennial dictum is to spread goodwill towards all men. The irony of course is that this is contrary to our nature. So why do we do it? Because we are being watched! And so we unselfishly think of others, assured that our good behavior will be rewarded with love and plutonium.

Peter:
 She's not getting it. Okay, boys, take her down.

Peter:
 Merry Christmas, buddy.

Brian:
 Wonder what this could be...oh.

Chris:
 This Christmas rocks!

Meg:
 Mom, Stewie's opening his gifts. Mom?

Peter:
 It's okay, Meg. Your mom's just full of Christmas cheer and enough tranquilizer to bring down a bull elephant. Uh, honey, you got a little something...you got a little...I'll get it.

Stewie:
 Hungry Hungry Hippos? Claus, you porcine double-crosser! And to think I was nice.

Brian:
 You got another one, dude.

Stewie:
 [gasping] Plutonium! He is real! He's really, really real!

Brian:
 So, Peter, did you get everything you wanted for Christmas?

Peter:
 You bet. A week's vacation, a new VCR. And best of all, my own copy of KISS Saves Santa.

Ace Frehley:
 You just practice that guitar, Santa. Next time we'll let you do a solo.

 Claus:
 Don't encourage him!

Brian:
 From all of us at Family Guy...

Meg:
 ...we wish you Christmas joy.

Chris:
 May all your wishes now come true...

Stewie:
 ...for every girl and boy.

Peter:
 We hope your freakin' holidays are filled with fun and cheer. So have a Merry Christmas and...

Brian:
 So, uh, tell me about yourself, Tina.

Tina:
 Well, I really love music.

Brian:
 Oh, God! Me, too! You know, I just saw Don Giovanni. In my opinion, the best opera of the 18th century.

Tina:
 Definitely.

Brian:
 And the use of recitative throughout.... Mozart was a genius.

Tina:
 [Stuttering] Oh, yeah. Reci-ta-tive is really where it's at.

Waiter:
 Sir, are we ready to order?

Brian:
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a second. You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?

Tina:
 Sure I do! Opera's bitchin'! Okay. I guess I'll have the es-car-got and a glass of chab-liss.

Brian:
 Same here. Es-car-got and the chab-liss.

Lois:
 Don't dawdle, Jonas. Play your exercises. Brian, you're home early, what happened with your date?

Brian:
 Same thing that always happens, she was an idiot.

Lois:
 Oh, Brian. Don't slow down Jonas, keep the rhythm. ? Bum, bum, bum, bum. Brian, your standards are ridiculously high, you'll never find a girl unless you're willing to make exceptions and compromise so you can find your love. ?

Brian:
 ? Lois, I don't think I have to compromise a thing, I'd rather be alone than with someone who doesn't get me, oh, and how long has the coffee been on the burner in the kitchen, I could really use a cup about now. ?

Lois:
 ? Oh, its not very fresh, you see I meant to make more but I made the mistake of getting caught up watching Oprah, she had on James Garner. ?

Brian:
 ? James Garner, what's he plugging? ?

Lois:
 ? I don't know, some crappy movie on TNT. ? Very good Jonas, I'll see you next week. So what is it Brian, you don't think these women understand you? Or...

Brian:
 You know, Lois, I'm really not comfortable talking about this amelodically.

Lois:
 Peter, I was wondering if you could...

Peter:
 Hang on a second, Lois

Announcer:
 And now back to The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams.

Ben:
 Um, Grizzly? Who's Steve?

Grizzly:
 What?

Ben:
 There's a message on the machine from somebody named Steve.

Grizzly:
 Oh, yeah, Steve. He's new to the mountain. I met him down at the general store. He makes canoes.

Ben:
 Oh. How come I've never met him?

Grizzly:
 He hasn't really been here that long.

Ben:
 Long enough to get your number!

Grizzly:
 Ben! Ben! Damn it.

Peter:
 Look at that Grizzly Adams, huh? Look at how confident he is, how majestic. Lois, I'm gonna grow a beard.

Lois:
 Oh, Peter, you know I hate beards.

Peter:
 No, no, Lois. It's time I joined the ranks of great men with beards. Why do you think Jesus Christ was so popular? Huh? 'Cause of all them magic tricks?

Lois:
 Listen, Brian's very depressed. Can you and the guys take him with you to the laser rock show tonight?

Peter:
 Aw, sure. If there's one thing I'm good at doing, it's cheering people up.

Peter:
 Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey, JonBenet's untimely death is a tragedy. And I will not rest until I find her killer, or killers.

 Ramsey:
 Oh, really. Don't bother. Nothing's going to bring our baby back.

Peter:
 No, no, I insist. I will make it my life's work to find out...

 Ramsey:
 We're fine! Just drop it!

Announcer:
 The next laser rock show will begin in 20 minutes.

Peter:
 You hear that, Brian? A laser rock show! Come on, cheer up, would you?

Brian:
 I don't much feel like it.

Presenter:
 Binary is the computer language in which words are translated into sequences of zeroes and ones. Anything at all can be expressed in binary as we demonstrate in this famous scene from 'The Miracle Worker.'

Annie Sullivan:
 Zero one, one zero, one zero, zero one.

Helen Keller:
 [Incomprehensible gibberish]

Annie Sullivan:
 Zero one, one zero, one zero, zero one!

Helen Keller:
 [Garbled repetition of binary phrase]

Annie Sullivan:
 Zero one! Zero one!

Old man:
 What, you don't think this is amazing? When I saw this at the 1904 World's Fair, I nearly crapped my pants!

Quagmire:
 All right! Virtual reality! Whoa, you guys gotta try this! Hey, look at me! I'm a pole in a strip club! It's show time. No! Stop! False alarm!

Peter:
 Oh, my God! I'm flyin', I'm flyin'! [in VR, Peter is seated on an airliner] Yes, I'll have a Diet Sprite.

Mayor West:
 <to own right hand> You are a filthy whore.

Cleveland:
 Okay, Johnny Depp or Richard Grieco?

Quagmire:
 Ah, that's gross!

Peter:
 Yeah, let's not do this!

Cleveland:
 Come on. If you're secure in your masculinity, you can answer a simple hypothetical.

Quagmire:
 All right. Johnny Depp because he kind of looks like a chick, I guess.

Cleveland:
 What about you, Peter?

Peter:
 Oh, man! I don't know. Richard Grieco would probably appreciate you more. You know, not take you for granted. I mean with Johnny Depp, it's like he wouldn't really need you, you know?. He'd probably sneak out after you fell asleep. Of course, with Johnny, you'd get the financial security. I'd go with Johnny.

Brian:
 Oh, great.

Joe:
 Brian.

Brian:
 Uh, hey, Joe. How's it going?

Joe:
 Pretty good. You were doing a little swerving back there.

Brian:
 Yeah, me and the boys were just...

Joe:
 Whoa, you're off the meter, Brian! You're under arrest.

Brian:
 Oh, come on!

Joe:
 Move it! One of you guys all right to drive?

Peter:
 Um, yeah. I can do it.

Joe:
 Great. I'll meet you at the Drunken Clam. We'll tie one on. <to Brian> I'm very disappointed in you.

 Title:
 ONE MONTH LATER]

Brian:
 God, a DUI! I can't believe this. I could actually go to jail!

Lois:
 It's okay, Brian. You'll get through this DUI, and you'll be a better person for it.

Stewie:
 Well now, hold on a minute. Don't disguise his alcohol dependence as a ticket to self-realization!

Brian:
 Look, you're not one to talk, all right? You remember that time I gave you apple juice and told you it was wine?

Stewie:
 <drunkenly> I think you are a special person.

Brian:
 Thanks.

Stewie:
 Now, come on! I'm being serious. I'm gonna be serious here for a second! Are you gonna listen to me? Are you gonna listen to me so I can tell you that I respect you? [Snickering]

Peter:
 Brian, I know this is a bad time for you. If I have any advice to give you, it is this. Grow a beard.

Lois:
 Peter, I wish you'd shave that thing. Beards are so ugly.

Wooly Willy:
 Hey!

Lois:
 Oh, relax, Wooly Willy. There's lots of fun things you can do with that. There we go.

Wooly Willy:
 Thanks!

Judge:
 On the charge of driving under the influence, this court finds you guilty.

Stewie:
 Yes! Good call. Churn the butter. Ooo, ooo!

Judge:
 In lieu of jail time, I sentence you to 100 hours of community service. Next item. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join these two in holy matrimony. If anyone objects to this union, speak now or forever hold your peace.

Mayor West:
 Quiet down! You had your chance!

Meg:
 So, what do you have to do for your community service?

Brian:
 I got assigned to the Outreach to the Elderly program. I gotta take care of some old woman who hasn't been out of her house in 30 years.

Chris:
 When I got caught at school with my hand down my pants I had to keep it there for a whole week. Ha! What a week!

Brian:
 I don't know, I guess taking care of this old woman'll be just like baby-sitting, only with bigger diapers.

Stewie:
 Aha! So they do make bigger diapers! That deceitful woman told me I'd have to learn to use the toilet. Well, fie on the toilet! It's made slaves of you all. I've seen it sitting in there, lazy, slothful, porcelain layabout feeding on other people's doo-doos while contributing nothing of its own to society! You get a job!

Brian:
 Uh, Pearl Burton? My name's Brian. I'm here from the Outreach to the Elderly program?

Pearl:
 You're late!

Brian:
 Ah! What the hell is this?

Pearl:
 Delousing powder! Everyone on the outside is filthy!

Brian:
 Well, you could have given me some warning!

Pearl:
 Here's your warning-it's gonna burn like hell in 30 seconds. I like my tea at 4:00, my dinner at 6:00. And I take my bath at 7:00 sharp, so I can listen to Paul Harvey. You will warm up my bath water with quick bursts from the faucet during commercials only. It's going to take you a while to get the rhythm-Paul Harvey moves seamlessly into commercials. By the way, it's been 30 seconds.

Lois:
 Peter, stop scratching that thing.

Peter:
 I can't. It's itching like crazy.

Chris:
 Dad, can I scratch your beard?

Peter:
 Have you finished your homework?

Peter:
 Okay then.

Lois:
 Brian, you've been awfully quiet. Is the community service not going that well?

Brian:
 Lois, it's horrible. I was cleaning her house all day. It's the worst job I've ever had. Well, except for one. <cut to Brian in apron, offering food samples at the supermarket> Excuse me. Would you like to taste my smoked-meat log?

Waiter:
 Here you go. Enjoy your food.

Stewie:
 Enjoy your studio apartment.

Lois:
 Peter, you got a little something right here.

Peter:
 Where? Here?

Lois:
 No, no, no. Other side.

Peter:
 Over here?

Lois:
 The left side.

Peter:
 Right here?

Lois:
 Your other left side.

Peter:
 Where am I at?

Lois:
 Up a little.

Peter:
 Do I have it?

Peter:
 Is it gone?

Lois:
 Now go down.

Peter:
 Is it gone? [screams] Is it gone? [screams] Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!

Lois:
 Peter, hold still! Hold still!

Peter:
 What's it to you, pal?

Lois:
 Doctor, what is this?

Chris:
 Ha ha! Rump.

Peter:
 This isn't funny, Chris! Ha ha ha, swallow. Look, just get rid of this bird, all right?

Lois:
 But, he can't walk around with a bird in his beard.

Meg:
 Wow! You sure know a lot of stuff.

Diners:
 'Cause knowledge is power!

Pearl:
 What is this? Spit soup?

Brian:
 Tomato bisque.

Pearl:
 What is this? Snot soup?

Brian:
 Tomato bisque!

Pearl:
 What is this? Diarrhea soup?

Brian:
 Look, I'm not making you anything else. So, just eat it, all right?

Pearl:
 Fine! Then I'll have to call the judge, and that means you'll go to jail! You're one phone call away from getting a human booster shot from a guy named Molly.

Peter:
 Damn it all! Sorry! Sorry!

Patrons:
 Hey, shut up! Keep it down! We're trying to watch-

Peter:
 Look, there's nothing I can do, all right?

Patrons:
 Take it outside, pal! Ever heard of a sitter?

Peter:
 Look, it's an endangered species. What am I supposed to...

Man:
 I'll make you an endangered species!

Peter:
 Oh, good comeback, Potsie!

Man:
 I'll kick your ass, that's what I'll do.

Peter:
 Look, everybody just shut up! Shut up! He has stopped squawking. He's receded into my beard. We can all watch the movie. Shut up.

Voice:
 Eric, if you're in here, we're all going to Marty's after the movie.

Lois:
 I love you so much.

Peter:
 I love you, too, honey.

Chris:
 What's wrong?

Peter:
 Now that's it. You're history, pal. No bird frenches my wife and gets away with it!

Pearl:
 Help! Help! I've broken my hip! Brian! 5.3 seconds. I could have been dead by now!

Brian:
 You mean, you're not really...

Pearl:
 I heard you drop that light bulb, too. That'll be 67 cents! Now, go warm me up some of that diarrhea soup!

Brian:
 That's it! I have had it with you, you old hag! You're just a miserable, dried-up shut-in trying to make everyone else feel as bad as you do! Why don't you do the world a big favor and drop dead?

Brian:
 This last one won't open.

Pearl:
 Jiggle it a little bit.

Brian:
 Like this?

Pearl:
 Nah, here, let me get it.

Brian:
 Thanks. And you know-drop dead.

Peter:
 Get out of my beard, you squawking bastard! Nothing. Well, I was hoping it wouldn't come to this.

Lois:
 Oh my God, Peter, no!

Peter:
 Lois, the bird must die!

Peter:
 It's gone! It's gone! Oh, thank God!

Lois:
 Peter, what's that sound?

Peter:
 Oh, my God! They're babies. Hey, look, Lois. There are three of them, just like ours. <Chris and Stewie's heads appear on the first two birds, then nothing on the third> And uh, um.... <Boba Fett's head appears on third bird> Sweet.

Announcer:
 We now return to E!'s Mysteries and Scandals. Pearl Burton, the Jingle Queen.

Brian:
 Pearl?

 Benza:
 I'm A.J. Benza. You won't find Pearl Burton's name on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Yet from 1945 to 1960, you couldn't turn on a radio or television without hearing one of her trademark jingles.

Pearl:
 ? You're only healthy when you're tan so soak up all the sun you can with Copper-Coppertone! ?

 Benza:
 At her peak, Pearl Burton earned 26 grand a year which by today's standards would be just under 49 billion dollars.

Lois:
 Brian, she's beautiful.

Brian:
 Yeah. And that voice. I had no idea.

 Benza:
 In 1961, Pearl used an appearance at Carnegie Hall to make the leap from jingle-singer to artist.

Pearl:
 [sings operatic aria]

Brian:
 That's Habanera from Carmen. I've never heard it sung so beautifully.

Audience:
 Sing Coppertone! Yeah, Coppertone! Do Doan's Pills! Sing Gold Bond Medicated Powder! Pepsodent! Chiclets! Chiclets!

 Benza:
 No one has seen Pearl Burton since that fateful night over 30 years ago. She's presumed dead.

Brian:
 My God! And I said all those awful things to her!

Brian:
 Pearl! Come on, Pearl! Don't do this!

Pearl:
 You should be happy! I'm taking your advice and doing the world a big favor! Now, move! Your fur is making my feet sweat!

Brian:
 Pearl, listen to me. I heard you sing. It was the most beautiful sound I've ever heard in my life.

Pearl:
 Sure. Warbling for Vicks VapoRub and Dippity-do!

Brian:
 No, no, Pearl, I mean...

Pearl:
 Ah, stop trying to talk me out of it! I'm a pathetic sellout!

Brian:
 No one who sings Carmen like you is pathetic!

Pearl:
 What?

Brian:
 I heard you sing Habanera. You were sublime.

Pearl:
 You liked my aria?

Brian:
 I was overwhelmed.

Pearl:
 You're the first person who ever complimented my Habanera. Thank you.

Brian:
 Well, I'd better get going. I'll see you tomorrow.

Pearl:
 But you're not scheduled tomorrow.

Peter:
 And then the cow came out of the barn. See? See, look. There's the cow. And what does a cow say? Yes, yes, that's right. A cow says peep-peep-peep-peep.

Lois:
 You know, Peter, they're getting awfully big.

Peter:
 So?

Lois:
 So, every good mother knows when it's time for her babies to leave the nest.

Peter:
 Hey, they're free to go anytime they want! [birds attempt to leave] Fine. I'll let them go.

Pearl:
 [sings final notes of Ave Maria]

Brian:
 Pearl, do you rent or own?

Pearl:
 Own what?

Brian:
 Those wings, you angel. That was fantastic. That was so incredible.

Pearl:
 So, what do you want for dinner? I was thinking about making us that lamb and rice you love.

Brian:
 Well, you know, Pearl, what I'd really like for dinner is to go out.

Pearl:
 Brian, you know I can't do that. I haven't left this house in such a long time. I'm afraid.

Brian:
 I know. But I'll be with you.

Pearl:
 I don't know.

Brian:
 Come on, Pearl. There's so much you've missed in the last 30 years. In fact, allow me to fill you in. ? The '60s brought the hippie breed And decades later, things have changed indeed We lost the values, but we kept the weed You've got a lot to see ?

Tom Tucker:
 There's lots of things you may have missed.

Mayor West:
 Like Pee Wee and his famous wrist.

Cleveland:
 Or Sandy Duncan's creepy phony eye.

Neil Goldman:
 That awesome Thundercats cartoon.

Diane Simmons:
 Neil Armstrong landing on the moon.

Meg:
 Neil Armstrong? Wait-was he the trumpet guy?

Brian:
 ? So, let's go see the USA They'll treat you right unless you're black or gay or Cherokee But you can forgive the world and its flaws and follow me there because you've still got a hell of a lot to see You've got a lot to see ?

Pearl:
 Brian, I've missed so much! I wouldn't be standing here right now if it wasn't for you!

Doctor:
 She's right in here. Just tell the disorderly when you're ready to leave.

Brian:
 Don't you mean the orderly?

Doctor:
 No, I mean the disorderly. That's a little doctor joke we like to make around here. We also like Kevin Pollack.

Brian:
 Oh, my God, Pearl!

Pearl:
 Brian, I don't have much time.

Brian:
 God, I never should have made you leave the house! This is all my fault!

Pearl:
 Don't be so hard on yourself. Aside from the truck part, this was the best day of my life. I only wish we could have a little more time together.

Brian:
 We can.

Peter:
 Good-bye, kids.

Brian:
 Good-bye, Pearl.

Doctor:
 Hey, who wants to see a dead body?

Peter:
 Rough week, huh?

Brian:
 I've seen better.

Peter:
 Brian, looks like somebody's checking you out.

Brian:
 I'm-I'm not ready yet. You're getting some looks yourself.

Peter:
 I'm not ready either.

Brian:
 Ah, thanks for coming, Lois. Mark's been trying to get me to see his one-man show for weeks.

Lois:
 I think it's wonderful you're supporting your old pal.

Mark:
 Go long, Eddie! Go long! Further! Further! [Playful groaning] Life sure was crazy growing up in Brooklyn. We had some real characters in my neighborhood, like Frank the Mailman. 'Hey, Mark, the ants for your ant farm came today!' And my friend Lonny, that knucklehead. 'Yo, Marky, let's play some b-ball.' 'B-ball.' That's what we called it. B-ball. And my grandma. Boy! Was she something else! 'Hey, Marky, don't forget to take your cod liver oil.'

Brian:
 God, what a piece of self-indulgent crap! All the characters sounded exactly the same.

Frank the Mailman:
 Great show, Mark.

Lonny:
 You really captured me perfectly.

s Grandma:
 Me, too, Marky. You are so talented.

Brian:
 That was awful. You know, with a little practice, I could act circles around that guy.

Lois:
 Oh, yeah? Well then, put up or shut up.

Brian:
 <reading> "This Thursday, auditions for the Quahog School of Performing Arts' upcoming semester."

Lois:
 You should try out.

Brian:
 You know, that's not a bad idea, Lois. Okay, ready for the best acting you've seen all night? Mark, wow! What a journey! Thank you so much. Those three-and-a-half hours just flew by.

Peter:
 Hey, Santos, Pasqual. Listen, you guys have done such good work today I got a surprise for you. Doritos! Not now. Later.

Pasqual:
 [in Portuguese] I'm going to try and get on that "Millionaire" show.

Santos:
 [in Portuguese] Fantastic! I will be your line for life!

Pasqual:
 [in Portuguese] It's "life-line"! Dammit, those are the kinds of mistakes we can't afford to make!

Dave:
 Help! Help!

Dave:
 Thanks. I was boogie-boarding and I got sucked out by the rip tide. I thought I was a dead man.

Peter:
 Oh, you've got to be starving. Here, eat these.

Santos:
 [in Portuguese] Hey! He's giving away our Doritos!

Pasqual:
 [in Portuguese] In Portugal, I was a cardiologist.

Lois:
 Oh, my God! He was just floating out there by himself?

Peter:
 Yep. He was so grateful I saved his life he invited us all over for dinner tonight.

Lois:
 Oh, good. I don't have to cook.

Peter:
 Oh, no, no-go ahead and cook anyway, Lois, and we'll throw it out. I don't want you to get rusty.

Brian:
 Say, Peter, my audition's coming up. Would you mind listening to my monologue?

Peter:
 Sure, buddy. Let's hear it.

Brian:
 [breathes deeply] "Julie, there's something I gotta tell you..."

Peter:
 Ha! That's awesome! Go on.

Brian:
 "...tell you. I saw Doctor Phil..."

Peter:
 Wow! Wow! Yes! Yes! I love it!

Brian:
 "...Doctor Philips today. I might not make it to Christmas."

Peter:
 Oh, yeah, drop the bomb. Drop it. There's not a dry eye in the house. Keep going.

Brian:
 No, you know what? I'm gonna stop. Maybe we'll work on it later.

Peter:
 Okay, well, just so you know, it was good. But I was also being pretty generous.

Peter:
 Well, look at you, you little jaybird. You want to tell your mommy and daddy the Griffins are here?

Dave:
 Come on in! Welcome, Griffins!

Lois:
 [stammering] We must be early.

Dotty:
 Oh, nonsense. You're right on time.

Peter:
 Oh, my God! She's got hair growing out of her boobs and up to her head!

Lois:
 You're, uh, you're completely...

Dotty:
 Nude? Yes. We're nudists.

Chris:
 Permission to freak out?

Lois:
 Peter, did you know about this?

Peter:
 I thought he lost his bathing suit in the ocean.

Dotty:
 So, you're the man who saved my husband's life. Dotty Campbell. Oh, what am I doing? Come here!

Peter:
 Watch my hands, Lois! See where they are? No touchie!

Dave:
 This is the back yard. Feel that? That's premium blue-tip Bermuda. Real hardy, but soft.

Lois:
 Oh, good lord!

Peter:
 Don't look directly into it, Lois.

Dotty:
 The hot dogs and burgers are ready. Can I get you a beer, Peter?

Peter:
 What do you got?

Dotty:
 I've got Busch. Oh, and Busch Light.

Dave:
 Sounds like Jeff's home. Hey, sport! How'd you do?

Jeff:
 I got first place, Dad.

Dave:
 Way to go, champ! Jeff plays varsity tennis for Saint Genevieve High.

Meg:
 Oh, cool.

Jeff:
 Is this the biggest thing you've ever seen?

Dave:
 Don't get too cocky. I had a big one like that when I was your age.

Dotty:
 Oh, you were a showoff yourself, Dave. He brought it out on our first date.

Peter:
 Lois, I'm scared. <drops hot dog beneath table> I'll get that.

Dave:
 Hey!

Peter:
 Oh, God! Oh, Dave, sorry! Oh, God.

Chris:
 Boobies!

Lois:
 Chris, that's enough. I'm sure glad to be out of there!

Peter:
 You said it. What those people are doing just ain't natural!

Lois:
 Did you hear me, young man?

Meg:
 I don't know what the big deal was. I thought they were nice.

Peter:
 Do it.

Lois:
 Did you have fun at the circus today?

Chris:
 Elephants are bigger in person.

Stewie:
 Break a leg up there, Brian.

Brian:
 Well, you seem awfully enthusiastic.

Stewie:
 At first I wanted you to fail. But then I realized you'd be out of the house five days a week, which means I'd be free to throw some of my sexy parties.

Simon:
 Brian Griffin?

Stewie:
 Good luck, Brian.

Brian:
 Hi, I'm Brian Griffin. This is from John Waltz's 'Leaving Wichita.' "Julie, there's something I gotta tell you. I saw Doctor Philips today. I might not make it to Christmas."

Simon:
 Ooh, thank you. Next.

Stewie:
 Next? Hold on, Brian! Stay up there! Stay there. Now, see here! Brian Griffin is a brilliant actor with talent and passion! But you alleged experts obviously didn't notice. Well, I did notice! I saw a man bare his soul up here! And his pain ran through my heart like an errant locomotive, but it was wasted, wasted on all of you!

Simon:
 [Murmuring] Well, it looks like we're going to have to reconsider. Brian, we want you...

Brian:
 Yes!

Simon:
 ...off the stage. But your young friend there would make a perfect addition to the school's Rising Star Program.

Stewie:
 Well, splendid! This calls for a sexy party!

Simon:
 Okay, funcakes, let's do a scene. Okay, Stewie, how about you and...uh, let's see, one of our veterans. Olivia.

Olivia:
 I'm not doing a scene with him! He's inexperienced! He'll drag my whole performance down!

Stewie:
 Are you serious? Is she serious?

Simon:
 Okay, Stewie, I'll give you a solo exercise. Now, you're gonna do a little exercise we call, "The Life Cycle." Now, Without using words, you're gonna act out your entire life from birth to death exactly as I describe it. Okay, ready? Lie down. Now, you're being born. Ready, and burst through the placenta! Now fast-forward. It's your first day of school. You're alone and scared. But it's all right, it's all right. It's sloppy-joe day. Okay, pull it back, pull it back. The lady touched the bun and she's not wearing gloves. Okay, fast-forward. You're a businessman and you manage a lot of people. And here comes Henderson and he lost the big account. You're mad. Madder. Madder! Come on. Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot! There it is. You got it. And fast-forward. You're an old man now. You're on your deathbed. Your son is there holding your hand. You tell him you accept his lifestyle and regret humiliating him at his only sister's wedding by introducing him as your "other daughter." And, scene. Okay, any comments?

Olivia:
 You are the weakest link! Good-bye!

Stewie:
 [Laughs] Oh, gosh! That's funny. That's really funny. Do you write your own material? Do you? Because that is so fresh. "You are the weakest link. Good-bye!" You know, I've never heard anyone make that joke before. You're the first. I've never heard anyone reference that outside the program before. Because, that's what she says on the show, right? "You are the weakest link. Good-bye!" And yet, you've taken that and used it out of context to insult me in this everyday situation. God, what a clever, smart girl you must be, to come up with that joke all by yourself. That's so fresh, too. Any Titanic jokes, you want to throw at me, as long as we're hitting these phenomena at the height of their popularity? Because I'm here. God, you're so funny.

Jeff:
 Meg?

Meg:
 Jeff? Wow, hey! What are you doing here?

Jeff:
 They had a sale on Super Soakers! Check it out.

Meg:
 [Giggling]

Jeff:
 What the heck?

Meg:
 Gosh, that's awful!

Jeff:
 Ah, that's all right. I'm used to it. Well, I better go. So, um, would you want to do something sometime?

Jeff:
 Sure. That'd be great.

Meg:
 Cool. I'll call you later.

Old Neighbor:
 Holy moly! It must be my birthday!

Stewie:
 [Ineffective blowing] [Farting noise] [Nervous laughter] Thank you. That was, 'Me Farting' by Chopin. Thank you very...

Stewie:
 So, Olivia. Beautiful day.

Olivia:
 You're not gonna fart again, are you?

Stewie:
 Well, I'd love to stay and chat. But you're a total bitch.

Teacher:
 The quarterly review's tomorrow. Think all your kids will pass?

Simon:
 Well, I'll tell you who's not gonna pass. It starts with an "O" and rhymes with "Bolivia." Give up? Olivia.

Teacher:
 Really?

Simon:
 Oh, yes! She's such a little frosty box! She won't work with anybody. And Stewie Griffin is also on the fence. If he and Olivia don't deliver at their quarterly reviews I'll just goint to have to kick their cute little bottoms out of here.

Olivia:
 Uh, this table is reserved for people with talent.

Stewie:
 Stow the 'tude, queenie. You and I have a problem. Read it and weep.

Olivia:
 "Doesn't work well with others"?

Stewie:
 Yes. Mine's no better. I'll spare you the details, suffice it to say the phrase "garden variety" appears a number of times.

Olivia:
 What am I going to do?

Stewie:
 What are 'we' going to do? Look, our evaluation's tomorrow. You need someone to work with and, well, I need someone to make me look good.

Olivia:
 I don't know.

Stewie:
 Well, fine! Refuse my offer. Get booted out of this place and wind up like Linda Evans.

Intercom:
 Linda Evans, we have a spill in Aisle 9. Linda Evans, spill in Aisle 9.

Meg:
 Do you like yours with crust or without?

Jeff:
 How do you like yours?

Meg:
 Okay, let's both answer at the same time. One, two, three.

Jeff:
 Without!

Meg:
 Without!

Jeff:
 Holy moly! That's eight things we have in common!

Lois:
 Kids, we're home.

Jeff:
 Hello, Mr. And Mrs. Griffin.

Meg:
 You guys remember Jeff?

Peter:
 Sure. Lois, I'm gonna borrow your Mace. <sprays self in eyes> That's better.

Lois:
 Meg, did any of the neighbors see Jeff come over?

Meg:
 Mom! Come on, Jeff. Let's go in the other room.

Lois:
 Now, Meg, no need to get so testes... Testy! Nuts! I mean crap!

Meg:
 You want to sit down?

Peter:
 Wait a second! Don't sit down yet!

Meg:
 Dad, what are you doing?

Peter:
 I'm uh, keeping the couch fresh.

Meg:
 Dad!

Jeff:
 It's okay, Meg. I understand what's going on here. I'm gonna go.

Peter:
 Oh, just step on these coasters on your way out. There we go, yeah. Don't step on the hot lava. The carpet is hot lava.

Meg:
 I can't believe you guys!

Peter:
 Meg, how could you bring that naked kid into our house?

Meg:
 Because I like him! He remembers my name!

Lois:
 Well, I'm sorry but we don't think you should see him anymore.

Lois:
 I hate the sound of her crying.

Peter:
 You know what sounds even worse?

Peter:
 Ah, listen to that. Don't you hate that? That is awful. I think it's easier on me 'cause I'm the one making the sound.

Simon:
 Okay, nice effort, Brad. But let's remember our performance hierarchy. Legitimate theater, musical theater, stand-up, ventriloquism, magic, mime. All right, next up is Olivia. Liv, what monologue are you doing for us this time?

Olivia:
 I'm not doing a monologue. I'm doing a piece with Stewie.

Simon:
 A duet. Really? Well, let's see it.

Stewie:
: A five, six, seven, eight ? Who's got the greatest gal around? ?

Olivia:
 ? You do! ? ? Who's got the sweetest man in town? ?

Stewie:
: ? You do ?

Olivia:
 ? Who's got a guy who makes her smile all day? ?

Stewie:
: By the way, I'm not so bad to look at either

Olivia:
 ? Who's got a guy with lots of brains? ?

Stewie:
: ? You do ?? Who's got the girl who loves chow mein? ?

Olivia:
 ? You do ?

Stewie:
: ? Who's got the greatest love in the world? ?

Stewie:
: ? And you do ?

Both:
 ? Thank goodness I've got you ?

Olivia:
 ? Who's got a guy to tell her jokes? ?

Stewie:
: ? You do ?? Who's got a girl to show the folks? ?

Stewie:
: ? Who's got a girl he'd like to one day undress? ?

Olivia:
 ? Give it a rest, I told you not until we're married ?

Stewie:
: ? Who's got the gal with all the snazz? ?

Olivia:
 ? You do ?? Who's got the fella with pizazz? ?

Stewie:
: ? You do ?? Who's got the greatest love in the world? ?

Simon:
 Watch this. Are you watching? [slaps self in face] That's for me ever having doubted you. A-plus!

Stewie:
 And that's for you wearing purple pants with blue socks! [Wincing] I totally called him on it.

Simon:
 Okay, no secrets. I want to share Stewie and Olivia with the world.

Lois:
 Well, they're awfully young. Is this really a good idea?

s Mother:
 It's a great idea. I've always dreamed of becoming an actress. That's not why I'm pushing Olivia to do it. Is it suspicious that I brought that up unprovoked?

Lois:
 Well, I guess it might be okay.

Peter:
 Sure, look at Elroy Jetson. He was a child actor and he turned out just fine.

Elroy:
 Do you know who I am? I'm Elroy Jetson!

Bar Manager:
 Yeah, yeah, come back when you have some money. Take him home, Bamm-Bamm.

Bamm:
 Bamm-bamm-bamm!

Elroy:
 I don't want to go home! Take me to Astro's grave!

Olivia:
 Do you hear that! They love us!

Stewie:
 Yes, we're a hit! You were amazing!

Olivia:
 Oh, so were you!

Stewie:
 It was a good crowd. They didn't even notice that you missed that F-sharp!

Olivia:
 Yes. Well...beg pardon?

Stewie:
 The F-sharp, darling. You were just slightly off.

Olivia:
 I'm pretty sure I wasn't!

Stewie:
 Oh, well, maybe it was me.

Olivia:
 Must've been you.

Stewie:
 I was being sarcastic.

Olivia:
 Well, it wasn't me!

Stewie:
 Well, it wasn't me!

 Olivia:
 [Singing single notes]

Stewie:
 Like this, listen to me!

Lois:
 Oh, hi, Meg.

Lois:
 Peter, Do you think maybe it was unfair to tell Meg she couldn't see that boy?

Peter:
 Oh, completely. We totally reamed her. Did you see that look in her eyes? She hates you.

Simon:
 Well, there it is, kids. Your first marquee. Meet you inside.

Olivia:
 Pretty exciting.

Stewie:
 What? The marquee or the other thing?

Olivia:
 What other thing?

Stewie:
 You know. The sex. With Simon. Why else would your name be first?

Olivia:
 Well, it's obvious. You know, lead with strength. Put your best foot forward, et cetera, et cetera.

Stewie:
 So, the sex was good?

Olivia:
 Oh, shut up, you egotistical jerk!

Stewie:
 You shut up, you sap-bellied strumpet!

Olivia:
 Blimp-headed jackass!

Stewie:
 Mealy-mouthed crotch pheasant!

 Olivia:
 ? Thank goodness I've got you ?

Meg:
 Jeff? What are you doing here? I'm not supposed to see you.

Jeff:
 Your parents invited me.

Meg:
 My parents? But they wouldn't...

Lois:
 Yes, we would.

Meg:
 Oh, my God! What are you doing?

Lois:
 We were wrong, Meg. If you like Jeff, we should give him a chance.

Peter:
 Yeah. We wanted him to feel welcome in our home.

Chris:
 Mom, I need new batteries for my Walkman. Hey, why is everybody else naked?

Peter:
 Yahtzee! I win! Yeah! In your face! In your face! In your face!

Meg:
 [Screaming]

Jeff:
 I gotta get going. Thanks, Mr. And Mrs. Griffin.

Lois:
 Our pleasure, Jeff.

Peter:
 Nice hanging with you, Jeff.

Meg:
 I'm sorry about my parents. I hope they didn't embarrass you.

Jeff:
 Are you kidding? I think they're great! It took a lot of guts for them to do what they did. I'll see you later.

Meg:
 Thanks, you guys. That was really cool.

Quagmire:
 Peter. Can I borrow your lawnmower? You folks got a towel?

Olivia:
 Would you be a dear and ask Stewie to dance on his own feet tonight?

Stewie:
 Pardon me, Simon, could you provide Olivia with a bucket so she can carry a tune?

Simon:
 People! People! Stop this craziness! The critic from the Providence Journal is here. If he gives us a good review, the doors are gonna fly open! Now, go get 'em, my little sillybillies!

Stewie:
 All right, let's just get through this.

Olivia:
 Fine with me.

Stewie:
 Wait a minute. You're wearing ruby lipstick. You're painted up like some attention-grabbing Jezebel!

Olivia:
 Well, you're one to talk! You've been stuffing your diaper since day one!

Stewie:
 It's where I keep my peppermint Mentos! Just because your breath reeks of rotten Lunchables doesn't mean mine has to.

Simon:
 Break it up! Break it up!

Olivia:
 I don't need this act, and I don't need you! You've done nothing but hold me back! I quit!

Stewie:
 The only thing I've held you back from is failure! Come on, Simon. We don't need that little Bebe No-worth!

Simon:
 I don't know, Stewie. Without Olivia this act is like Fire Island after Labor Day. Over!

Stewie:
 Fine! I don't need you! I can manage my own career! [Stammering] Yes, I'm quite capable of that.

Stewie:
 ?I've got my top hat and cane and a pocketful of miracles? ?Pocketful of miracles, Pocketful of miracles?

Stewie:
 No, wait, wait! I was about to do this thing. [does the vaudeville running in place routine]

Stewie:
 Oh, hello. Didn't notice you there. It's not easy living with my family. A bunch of characters they are. Like my father: 'Holy crap, Lois! Check out the freakin' log in the toilet!'

Elroy:
 Get off the stage!

Stewie:
 What do you say, Bernie? Two nights at the old rate?

Retirement Home Manager:
 Like I told you before, kid, I can't book you without Olivia.

Stewie:
 But that's the good news. We're back together. She's right here. <holds up ventriloquist dummy of Olivia>

Olivia doll:
"Hi, Bernie. Glad to be back. Ask Stewie about his sexy parties."

Stewie:
 "Ask Stewie about his sexy parties." What were you thinking?

Olivia doll:
 I was just trying...

Stewie:
 I'm not speaking to you.

Olivia doll:
 But, Stewie...

Stewie:
 Shut up!

Stewie:
 I guess the best advice I got was from Marty Scorsese. I was having a problem understanding why I'd be taking abuse from this lower-ranking officer played by Chris O'Donnell. And he told me, "You don't have to understand it. Your character does." Oh, that always stuck with me.

Olivia:
 Stewie?

Stewie:
 Olivia, what are you doing here? I must be an absolute mess. The studio made me fire my make-up girl.

Olivia:
 Oh, I just wanted to stop by and see how you were doing. I had heard some things.

Stewie:
 That it's going great for me? Well, you heard right!

Olivia:
 Glad to hear that.

Stewie:
 But, hey, you know, if you're not busy, um, what say you and I get the old team back together?

Olivia:
 Well, actually, I can't. I'm on my way to Hollywood. I got this part in a movie, and...

Stewie:
 [Stammering] What am I thinking? I'd love to. But I'm booked solid. I'm doing a three-episode guest shot on 'The Gilmore Girls.' I'm playing Rory's motorcycle-driving boyfriend. He's a bad boy at heart, but there's some good in there, Olivia. And it comes through, absolutely.

Olivia:
 That's really good to hear, Stewie. Please, take care of yourself.

Stewie:
 See you on the coast!

Limo Driver:
 So, did you let him have it?

Olivia:
 No. He let himself have it.

Orderly:
 This is it.

Brian:
 Hey, uh, how're you doing, kid?

Stewie:
 Are you from Wardrobe?

Brian:
 No, it's me, Brian. I brought what you wanted. But they wouldn't let me leave it. So...

Stewie:
 Hit it once, please. Just once.

Stewie:
 [Sings note] Oh, my God! I was flat. All right, then. Help me up. Let's go home.

Peter:
 Gosh, some of this stuff, you wonder who would ever need it in bulk. I mean, like watermelons.

Peter:
 Touché, CostMart.

Lois:
 Brian, will you watch Stewie for a minute?

Brian:
 Sure.

Lois:
 And please keep a close eye on him. Remember what happened last time.

Brian:
 Stewie, get down before you hurt yourself.

Stewie:
 Shut up! You're not my mother!

Brian:
 Good God! Are you all right?

Stewie:
 Fine. Why do you ask?

Peter:
 Mmm, delicious. I will seriously consider purchasing this product.

Samurai Peter:
 Ah, Sausage-san. Plan to buy great amount for samurai buddies.

Clerk:
 Sir, you don't have to keep moving to the back of the line. You can have as many as you want. They're free.

Samurai Peter:
 What are you talking about?

Peter:
 Can I have some more sausage?

Lois:
 Ooh, they got a great deal on pianos if you buy a four-pack. Meg, help me get these down.

Ross:
 Lois?

Lois:
 Oh, my God! <piano crushes Meg> I can't believe this. Ross Fishman, is that really you? I haven't seen you since college. How are you?

Ross:
 Great, great. Wow, Lois! You haven't aged a bit.

Lois:
 Oh, thank you. This 12-pack of fungicide is for my daughter, Meg.

Meg:
 Help me.

Stewie:
 Ah, yes, there you are! You people at the Industrial Adhesives Corporation certainly know how to make a tasty glue. Well then, let the banquet begin!

Brian:
 Whoa, whoa, what the hell are you doing? Don't eat that.

Stewie:
 Oh, for God's sake! Don't be such a nerd!

Brian:
 Look, I'm supposed to keep an eye on you. If Lois sees this, she'll kill me.

Stewie:
 You can let go of my hand now.

Brian:
 You can let go of mine.

Brian:
 Oh...

Stewie:
 ...crap!

Lois:
 Ross, I can't tell you how wonderful it's been to see you. It's a crime that it's been so long. We were so close.

Ross:
 Maybe we could get together for a cup of coffee, catch up.

Lois:
 Well...I don't know, Ross. I'm married now.

Ross:
 Well, so am I. Does that mean we can't stay in touch with old friends? Tell you what. If you change your mind, here's my card.

Chris:
 Hey, look, Dad! They have 12-packs of kidneys!

Peter:
 Yeah, but you got to buy the cooler, too. That's how they get you.

Brian:
 Okay, thanks.

Stewie:
 Well?

Brian:
 The good news is the same company makes a solvent that'll get us unstuck. The bad news is it takes two weeks for delivery.

Stewie:
 You're telling me that we're stuck like this for a bloody fortnight?

Brian:
 You cannot tell Lois about this.

Stewie:
 Oh, and what if I do?

Brian:
 I'll show her the pictures of you wearing her wedding dress.

Stewie:
 You said there was no film in that camera!

Lois:
 Come on, Stewie. Time to change your diaper.

Brian:
 Mind if I watch?

Lois:
 And I'm just ashamed of myself that I let Peter's jealousy prevent me from rekindling an old friendship just because it was with a man.

Brian:
 Yeah, Peter's not exactly the most understanding guy with you and other men. Like that time at the movies?

Hugh Grant:
 [Stammering] My, this is terribly awkward. But I wanted to tell you something. But I don't know. I seem to be so charmingly befuddled.

Lois:
 Oh, that Hugh Grant is so handsome.

Peter:
 Oh, is that how it is? Come here, you home-wrecking bastard!

Chris:
 Don't do it, Dad! He's bigger than you!

Brian:
 And when you went to that concert?

Singer:
 Thank you, thank you very much. This next one is for all the ladies out there.

Brian:
 And then there was last Saturday night.

Lois:
 Look at that handsome man.

Peter:
 You son of a bitch! [punches mirror]

Lois:
 I can't let Peter's irrational emotions run my life! I'll call Ross and see if it's not too late to take him up on his offer. Would you mind finishing up?

Brian:
 Uh, sure.

Stewie:
 Yes, yes, do you like cleaning my doodie, Brian? Say it. Say, "I like cleaning your doodie, Stewie." Ha! Don't forget the taint.

Magnum:
 TC, you fly the chopper around the island. I'll go talk to the beautiful women. And Tattoo here will keep an eye out for the kidnappers.

Higgins:
 Higgins.

Magnum:
 We'll need to have security unlock the gate for me out front. Okay, Tattoo?

Higgins:
 It's Higgins.

Magnum:
 What?

Higgins:
 The name is Higgins.

Magnum:
 What's your name?

Higgins:
 Tattoo!

Lois:
 Oh, um, Peter, I'm just gonna go out for a few hours. So, I'll return in a few hours.

Peter:
 Yeah, I'll do it when this is over. Hey, Lois, can you grab me a beer? Lois?

Peter:
 All right. Then you be Lois.

Peter:
 Hey, Lois, can you grab me a be-oh, my God! You've really let yourself go!

Chris:
 Well, maybe if you bought me some nice clothes once in a while!

Joe:
 Peter Griffin, we know you're in there! Come out with your hands up!

Cleveland:
 Fooled you!

Peter:
 Yeah, you sure did. What the hell is this?

Joe:
 It's the new police surveillance van. We're going on a beer run. Want to join us?

Peter:
 Nah, I quit drinking. I think I might be an alcoholic.

Cleveland:
 What?

Joe:
 Oh, my God!

Quagmire:
: Oh, man!

Peter:
 Fooled you! Come on, let's go drink till we can't feel feelings any more.

Joe:
 This van has the latest in law-enforcement technology. Watch.

Van:
 Suspect! Suspect! You have the right to remain silent!

Cleveland:
 Hey, let me try.

Joe:
 Cleveland, don't!

Van:
 Minority suspect! Minority suspect! Danger, he's got a gun!

Cleveland:
 [shouting]

Quagmire:
: Oh, no, the van's gone!

Joe:
 No, no, it's got a cloaking device that disguises it as two homeless guys fighting over a wedge of cheese.

Quagmire:
 Hey, Peter, isn't that Lois over there in that diner?

Peter:
 What would Lois be doing at a diner? I already ate.

Joe:
 Take a look.

Peter:
 Oh, my God! That is Lois! Why the hell would she... Whoa! I can see your skin cells!

Peter:
 What the hell is Lois doing with another man?

Quagmire:
 Is it possible she's a whore? You know, just on weekends to help pay for her mom's dialysis? As in my fantasy? You know what? Let's just start over. Hi, I'm Quagmire.

Peter:
 I wish I knew what she was saying.

Joe:
 I think I can help.

Lois:
 Your wife and children are beautiful. It's so good to catch up, Ross. I'm glad I called.

Ross:
 I'm glad you did, too. Was your husband okay with you coming here?

Lois:
 Uh, yes, he turned out to be just fine with it.

Joe:
 All right. Let's see what we can pick up.

Mort Goldman:
 Please don't spit in my eggs. Please don't spit in my eggs. "Thank you for the eggs!" God, I hope he didn't spit in my eggs!

Waiter:
: Hey, Doug. I just spit in that guy's eggs.

Rat:
 Our armies are ready. Soon it will be time to leave the sewers and strike back at the humans in the overworld.

Lois:
 I'm glad we both found someone to make us happy. I really enjoy being with you, Ross. I'm having a great time.

Peter:
 Oh, my God! That's who that is. Ross Fishman, Lois's old boyfriend.

Joe:
 I think we're losing them.

Peter:
 Wait! I got to hear more!

Joe:
 Peter, the power's not supposed to go that high!

Quagmire:
 Damn, this itches! I wonder who gave it to me. Probably that skank who needed a ride to the gas station! Last time I do somebody a favor! Oh, God! They must have heard me! Oh, God! I can hear me! [hums ('The Stars and Stripes Forever'?) ]

Stewie:
 [Exclaiming] What the hell do you think you're doing?

Brian:
 I'm cleaning myself.

Stewie:
 You were clean 15 minutes ago, now you're just on vacation.

Peter:
 So, Lois is seeing old boyfriends, huh? Well, two can play at that game. I just gotta find my little black book. [Dramatic instrumental music] Ah, here it is.

Peter:
 Brenda?

Brenda:
 Peter! Oh, my God! It's been 25 years!

Peter:
 Yeah. I guess you're married now, huh?

Brenda:
 Yeah. Ricky, you were right! I was pregnant!

Peppermint Patty:
 What's up, Pete? Long time no see.

Peter:
 Gosh, Patty! The years have been great to you.

Peppermint Patty:
 Well, I owe that to my better half.

Marcy:
 Who is it, sir?

Peter:
 Angie?

Angie:
 Peter? Oh, my God! Come in!

Peter:
 Uh, what is all this stuff?

Angie:
 Peter, I have been waiting for this moment for 25 years! I haven't washed my hand since you last touched it.

Peter:
 Oh, my God! That's disgusting!

Angie:
 And look! Look! I left the toilet just as it was the night we went to prom. It's the little piece of you that's kept your memory alive. But now I have you back...

Angie:
 Oh, well. At least I still have you. You hungry?

Brian:
 Oh, crap! All right. Let me handle this.

Cop:
 You were going 65, fella. That's 10 miles over the...why are you holding that infant's hand?

Stewie:
 We met on the Internet.

Brian:
 Shut up!

Stewie:
 Yes, he lured me down to the park with promises of candy and funny stories.

Brian:
 Officer, you ever hear of that super industrial adhesive?

Meg:
 Dad, how come you keep looking at the door?

Peter:
 Oh, Meg. You and your drugs . [Doorbell rings]

Peter:
 I wonder who that could be.

Hooker:
 Peter Gifford?

Peter:
 My God! Dora, my old girlfriend. What a surprise that you would want to look me up! You always thought I was so handsome.

Lois:
 Peter, can I see you in the other room?

Brian:
 Yeah, go. Say it.

Stewie:
 Should I?

Brian:
 Yeah.

Stewie:
 I can't.

Brian:
 Just say it.

Stewie:
 Okay. How far can you get this banana...I can't say it. She's looking right at me.

Lois:
 Peter, what the hell is this about?

Peter:
 I'll tell you what it's about. It's about you and Ross Fishman!

Peter:
 I saw you with him the other day breaking the fifth commandment! Congress passes these things for a reason, Lois!

Lois:
 That's it! Peter, you're suffocating me with your jealousy. I can't take it anymore. I'm calling a marriage counselor. I can't even have coffee with a friend without you freaking out! What is your problem?

Peter:
 You want to know what my problem is? You want to know what my problem is? I love too much!

Lois:
 Peter, what are you talking about?

Peter:
 Don't you see, Lois? We're alive!

Lois:
 Peter, you're scaring me!

Peter:
 Good! Embrace the fear! Dance with me, Lois! Dance the dance of life! <crashes into china cabinet> Yeah, maybe you should call that marriage counselor.

Marriage Counselor:
 Mr. And Mrs. Griffin, I have reviewed your situation and I have a suggestion.

Lois:
 We're willing to do whatever it takes.

Marriage Counselor:
 I'd like to put video cameras in every room of your house so that I can observe your uncensored behavior.

Peter:
 Wow! Just like that show, Big Brother. Except somebody'll be watching.

Marriage Counselor:
 All right. I've looked through all the video footage. I've compiled what I believe to be an accurate cross-section of your home life. Here are the results.

Lois:
 Peter, give Chris a spanking.

Peter:
 Okay. Chris, I'm watching the game. You know what to do.

Chris:
 [Shouting] This hurts me more than it hurts you.

Lois:
 [reading aloud] "Dear Diary, Kevin is so hot. Today he was out in the yard raking leaves. God, I wish he'd throw me into that pile of leaves!"

Meg:
 Hey, what's everybody... Oh, my God! My diary! I hate you all! [Meg wailing]

Peter:
 Keep going.

Peter:
 No. It's step-hip-step-pivot. Are you trying to piss off the volcano?

Stewie:
 Get my back, would you? Oh, that's it. Ooo, that feels good.

Peter:
 Hey, Lois, can you give me a hand with this jar?

Lois:
 Oh, For heaven's sake, Peter! [Bees swarm from jar] [Lois screaming]

Peter:
 Gotcha!

Marriage Counselor:
 To be honest, I've never seen such dysfunction. Mr. and Mrs. Griffin, what I'm about to suggest may seem unorthodox. I recommend a trial separation, during which time I advise that you date other people. I believe this will help you gather perspective on your marriage.

Lois:
 Date other people?

Marriage Counselor:
 I realize this is very upsetting for you. That's why I've invited Howie Mandell to lighten the mood by blowing up a surgical glove with his nose.

Peter:
 Boy, this feels really weird, Lois.

Lois:
 I know. But maybe the doctor's right. This time apart could be good for us.

Peter:
 I don't know, Lois. Splitting up didn't work too well for Pac-Man and his wife.

Red Ghost:
 Hey, c'mon, buddy. Forget about her.

Green Ghost:
 Yeah. You're too good for her anyway.

Yellow Ghost:
 Cheer up, man.

Red Ghost:
 Hey! You want to eat us? Huh? We're turning blue! We've got nowhere to run!

Yellow Ghost:
 Oh, my God! He's gonna get us!

Red Ghost:
 Yeah, he's not budging. Come on. Let's go to Q*Bert's.

Peter:
 I really appreciate you putting me up, Cleveland.

Cleveland:
 Our house is your house, Peter. I'd sit here and chat with you, but I need to get back upstairs to Loretta because it's our anniversary and the gettin's good.

Cleveland:
 When is it gonna be my turn?

Muriel Goldman:
 You are welcome to stay with us as long as you like.

Peter:
 Thanks, Muriel. So, uh, what do you guys do for fun around here?

Mort Goldman:
 We like to watch old movies while listening to Hotel California to see if it synchs up in a significant way. And so far, no. Nothing has.

Quagmire:
 Hey, Lois. Is Peter there?

Lois:
 Hi, Quagmire. No, Peter's not home. We're, uh-we're having some minor marital problems. Our therapist has advised us to date other people.

Quagmire:
 Hey, Lois, you want to go out?

Lois:
 What? I don't know, Glen. Peter and I just separated. I feel like I need more time.

Lois:
 We are supposed to see other people. I guess it's better to go out with you than some sex pervert.

Quagmire:
 I'm in! [Jabbering excitedly]

Stewie:
 God blast it! Would you hold it for five seconds? [Panting] Okay.

Neil Goldman:
 So, Mr. Griffin, how does it feel to be a bachelor on the prowl once again?

Peter:
 It's not as great as you might think. I just don't have the same way with women that I used to.

Peter:
 That was nice. That was nice. I had a really great time with you today, beautiful stranger. What's your sign? [Laughing] Gross. I still think you're neat though.

Mort Goldman:
 You should try a video dating service, Peter. That's how Muriel and I met.

Muriel Goldman:
 Let me show you Mort's tape. He was so charming.

Mort Goldman:
 Ah! Oh, my eyes! Could you please turn down that very bright light? It's burning my retinas. Ladies, I'm a very desperate man. My name is Mort and I live with my mother. And I have very low standards. <sneezes> Oh, God! There's blood in my mucus!

Stewie:
 What the hell is wrong with you?

Brian:
 Hey, there's the mail! Finally. All right, it says it takes an hour for this solvent to take effect.

Stewie:
 Well, let's see. What takes an hour? We could watch Rita Rudner do five minutes of stand-up.

Brian:
 Ba-zing.

Quagmire:
 Oh, boy! We're gonna have a swell time tonight, Lois.

Lois:
 Glen, thank you for being such a good friend and looking after me like this.

Quagmire:
 No problem. It's chilly out, so I brought you a jacket.

Lois:
 No, thanks. I'll be fine.

Quagmire:
 Please?

Mort Goldman:
 Peter, Muriel and I both feel that you need to follow your therapist's advice and start dating.

Peter:
 Aw, geez, Mort! I don't know if I'm ready.

Mort Goldman:
 Come on, stud. We've got it all set up for you to go out with our niece. Honey, come on out here and meet Peter Griffin. Peter, this is our niece, Jennifer Love Hewitt.

Jennifer Love Hewitt:
: Nice to meet you.

Peter:
 All right, I'm getting up. Hi. Peter Griffin. Where do you want to go? Anywhere except the disco. They don't let me in anymore.

Peter:
 Crappy Mexicans and your glass candy!

Brian:
 What's going on?

Man:
 There's a little girl down in that well.

Brian:
 Oh, my God!

Man:
 Unfortunately, nobody's arms are long enough to reach her. Except that one guy. But he's helping that woman tickle a midget in a tree.

Midget:
 Hee-hee-hee! Stop it!

Stewie:
 Oh, God! You want to rescue her, don't you? It's times like this I wish they'd used me for stem-cell research.

Girl:
 Help me!

Stewie:
 It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again. Ha!

Brian:
 All right, I'm gonna lower you in.

Stewie:
 I just noticed. How often do you see a 17th century well in this day and age?

Brian:
 Hurry up! The glue's wearing off!

Brian:
 All right! All right!

Brian:
 We did it.

Stewie:
 Job well done.

Brian:
 And, we're not stuck together any more.

Stewie:
 Thank God!

Brian:
 You said it.

Stewie:
 You want to hold hands on the walk home?

Brian:
 Yeah, sure.

Mother:
 Oh, Susie! Thank God you're all right! Wait a minute. This isn't my little girl.

Midget:
 Hey, that was my wife!

Jennifer Love Hewitt:
 I Know What You Did Last Summer?

Peter:
 Never heard of it.

Jennifer Love Hewitt:
 The Devil and Daniel Webster?

Peter:
 Nope.

Jennifer Love Hewitt:
 Party of Five?

Peter:
 Was that a porno? Hey, hey, don't worry about it. Sometimes you gotta do a lot of crap before they put you in anything decent. Aw, the food here is fantastic. This is where I took Lois on our first date.

Jennifer Love Hewitt:
 You ordered a pie for an appetizer?

Peter:
 Oh, yeah, don't worry. I'll go to the john and fire one out in five minutes. That should make room for dinner.

Waiter:
 Here's your table, Mr. Quagmire.

Quagmire:
 Thanks. Hey, how about a couple of drinks?

Waiter:
 Certainly, sir. Martini for you and the usual roofie colada for your date?

Quagmire:
 No, no, no. I wouldn't bring...a glass of wine.

Lois:
 Oh, my God! That's Jennifer Love Hewitt! Wow! I wonder who she's here with? She could date any man she wanted to.

Peter:
 There. Made lots of room. Hey, waiter. That sign in the bathroom about washing your hands...that's only for the staff, right?

Waiter:
 Uh, technically, yes.

Peter:
 That's what I thought. Great. Oh, man! These all look good, every one of them. You want some bread?

Jennifer Love Hewitt:
 No!

Lois:
 Peter, is that you?

Quagmire:
 Peter? Oh, no! I can't let him see me!

Lois:
 It's okay, Quagmire. We're just doing what the therapist said we should do. Peter, I think it's great you're out with Jennifer Love Hewitt. Hi. I loved you in "Heartbreakers." You be on your best behavior.

Peter:
 Here you go, sweetheart. Open up.

Peter:
 There you go. Isn't this romantic?

Jennifer Love Hewitt:
 That's it! You have got to be the most vile, disgusting human being I've ever met! And I have never been more turned on in my life.

Lois:
 Hold on, toots! I don't care what our therapist says. I won't stand by and watch my husband lock lips with another woman! Now, beat it!

Jennifer Love Hewitt:
 What's your problem, Grandma?

Lois:
 You are! And I only saw Heartbreakers on a plane! And the flight was delayed, so the headphones were free!

Peter:
 Wow! That was pretty cool, Lois.

Lois:
 Gosh! I guess I finally understand...

Jennifer Love Hewitt:
 [screaming]

Lois:
 Yeah, you better run, you little bitch! I guess I finally understand how you can get so jealous sometimes. Seeing her kiss you like that just made me crazy.

Peter:
 Well, I guess we're just gonna have to learn to control our jealousy together.

Lois:
 Together.

Waiter:
 Ma'am, you dropped your napkin.

Waitress:
 Here's your drink, sir.

Peter:
 Ah, we'll work on it later. I love you, Lois.

Lois:
 I love you, too, Peter.

Jennifer Love Hewitt:
 What a couple of freaks! God, I need a drink!

Quagmire:
 Waiter! Martini and a roofie colada!

Stewie:
 I say! It's 4:00. Away with you!

Meg:
 Stewie!

Chris:
 Change it back!

Brian:
 Forget it. Jolly Farm Revue is on. It's the latest indoctrinating pablum for children with not enough to do.

Stewie:
 Hey! Shut up!

Mother Maggie:
 Wakey-wakey, children.

 Stewie:
 Good morning, Mother Maggie.

Mother Maggie:
 The sun has risen on another day in Jolly Farm. Let's see what life's rich pageant has in store for us.

Stewie:
 Oh, she has the voice of an angel! Not to mention a balcony you could do Shakespeare from.

Mother Maggie:
 Play your song, Melody Sheep, to aid the little ones' nourishment. But play softly, for Pengrove Pig wishes to read aloud from his magic tome that holds every book ever written.

Pengrove Pig:
 "These were difficult times for the children of Ipswich, when the lollipop famine cursed their pleasant village. "

Brian:
 How can you stand watching this? It's dreck and you know it. Oh, don't have the guts to respond, huh? No intelligent defense of this unmitigated crap?

Peter:
 Commercial! <punches Brian> I'm gonna get some graham crackers.

Moderator:
 Welcome back to KISS Forum, Rhode Island Public Access' most popular show about KISS.

Peter:
 Lois, hurry! It's back on!

Lois:
 Calm down, Peter. You know I wouldn't miss a second of this.

Moderator:
 Okay, let's take a call. You're on KISS Forum.

Moderator:
 Okay, good call. Good call. All right. You're on KISS Forum.

Moderator:
 Whoa!

Peter:
 Trace the call! Trace the call!

Moderator:
 Wait a sec. I recognize that voice! Is this Dennis De Young, lead singer from Styx? Come clean, man.

Moderator:
 Dennis, you jealous douche, how about I crank a little 'Detroit Rock City' and play 'Come Sail Away' and we can see how they stack up side by side? Huh? You want that, you high-voiced bastard? We'll be right back, after this.

Paul Stanley:
 Hey! Didn't see you come in. We're getting into shape for our upcoming tour.

Gene Simmons:
 We're playing five big shows in five days. So, if you...

Ace Frehley:
 Rock and roll!

Gene Simmons:
 Why, Why don't you just sit in the corner, huh? Go on. If you're a KISS fan, and you live in the Northeast come out for all five shows of what we're calling "KISS-Stock."

Peter:
 Aw, Hell! The Northeast! It's times like this I curse the fact that we live in French Polynesia.

Lois:
 No, Peter, we're in the Northeast.

Peter:
 We are? And KISS is coming to the Northeast. That means...aw.

Lois:
 That means-

Peter:
 No, no, Lois! Don't help me! It means we can do something.

Lois:
 Come on, Peter. You're almost there.

Peter:
 We can go to KISS-Stock!

Dentist:
 Owww!

Peter:
 Hey, yo, Lois!

Peter:
 I'm packing for KISS-stock and I can't find my favorite underwear.

Lois:
 You mean the pair with the rip in the right buttcheek from when you stepped on them pulling them up in that airplane bathroom from when you had the trots?

Peter:
 No, the pair with the hole in the left buttcheek from when I held it in for two hours 'cause it was that extra long Palm Sunday church sermon and blowing gas would offend Jesus, so I let it go in the vestibule after Mass, and it sounded like Louis Armstrong?

Lois:
 Oh, bottom drawer.

Mother Maggie:
 Children, tell Mother Maggie what you want to be when you grow up.

Stewie:
 What's my future coming from these squalid surroundings? Getting into a fight at the Laundromat with some dude who hit on my baby's mama? I should be there, not here! <dreamy music> London.

Chris:
 Hey, Dad? Can me and Meg stay up late every night when you're at KISS-Stock?

Peter:
 You can do whatever you want, son. Just don't eat from the candy tree.

Candy Tree:
 He's right to caution you. I feed on children.

Brian:
 You don't mind watching Stewie for a few days, do you, Brian?

Brian:
 Nah. Ever since Jolly Farm Revue came on, he's been pretty distracted. It'll be a breeze.

Lois:
 Well, 'Bye, everyone.

Meg:
 I can't believe my stupid parents are gonna spend five days following stupid old KISS around. It's painful.

Peter:
 I'll miss you.

Brian:
 Hey, Stewie, what do you want for lunch?

Stewie:
 <voiceover> Dear stupid dog, I've gone to live with the children on Jolly Farm. Good-bye forever, Stewie. P.S. I never got a chance to return that sweater Lois gave me for Christmas. Um, I left the receipt on top of my bureau. I'm probably over the 30-day return limit but I'm sure if you make a fuss they'll at least give you a store credit or something. It's actually not a horrible sweater. It's just, I can't imagine when I would ever wear it , you know? I also left a button on the bureau. I'm not sure what it goes to but I can never bring myself to throw a button away. I know as soon as I do I'll find the garment it goes to, and then it'll.... Wait a minute. Actually, could it have been from the sweater? Did that sweater have buttons? Well, I should wrap this up before I start to ramble. Again, good-bye forever. P.P.S. You know, it might be a little chilly in London. I'm actually going to take the sweater.

Stewie:
 One of these planes must be going to London.

British mother:
 Queue up, children. Spit spot. Here are the tickets, miss. These are all ours. Thank you.

Stewie:
 Spit spot, Albert Hall, meat and two veg, Big Ben, Dave Clark Five, Spam and eggs, a baby's arm holding an apple, pip pip, cheerio.

Flight Attendant:
 Hot towel?

Stewie:
 Yes, thank you. <drops drawers> Well, come on!

Stewie:
 What the hell are you doing here?

Brian:
 I'm taking you off this plane.

Stewie:
 Think again, Rover.

Brian:
 Great. I'm stuck on a trans-Atlantic flight with a petulant runaway. How could this get any worse?

Andy Rooney:
 You know what I hate about flying? The peanuts. First of all, you can't get them open. Who are they trying to keep out of these things?

Seinfeld:
 And what's the deal with the razor-blade slot in the bathroom? Are people actually shaving in there?

Andy Dick:
 Hi, Andy Dick here. Excuse me. I've got to get my bag up in the overhead bin here. [Yelling and laughing] Wow, that's wacky!

Stewie:
 There now, that wasn't so bad, was it? Did you sleep at all?

Brian:
 Yeah, a little.

Stewie:
 I couldn't sleep a wink-my pillow smelled like farts. But that's all right, because we're in England.

Brian:
 Uh-oh.

Stewie:
 Well, I don't get it. Where are England's verdant fields, its rosy-rumped maids, and buck-toothed solicitors?

Brian:
 About 3,000 miles that way. We're in the Middle East.

Stewie:
 Where are we going?

Brian:
 I don't know. I'm not exactly familiar with this particular Arabian village.

Stewie:
 Great. Buy one and let's get out of here.

Brian:
 What do you mean, buy one? All I've got is $50. We're gonna have to distract him. Follow my lead.

 Brian:
 ? You and I are so awfully different ? ? Too awfully different, to ever be pals ?

Stewie:
 Do you want to go first?

Brian:
 Yeah, I'll go. ? Your favorite hero is the Marquis de Sade ?

Stewie:
 Oh, you're one to talk. ? You get a stiffy from Phylicia Rashad ?

Brian:
 Oh, one time

Stewie:
 ? I'm a style flair, just look at my hip hair ?

Brian:
 Oh yeah, thats quite a nice 'do there

Stewie:
 Oh, thanks.

Brian:
 <Triumph the Insult Comic Dog voice> For me to poop on!

Stewie:
 What?

Brian:
 Oh c'mon, you look like Charlie Brown.

Stewie:
 Bite me, Snoopy

 Brian:
 ? There's not, a whole lot, that we've got, to agree on ?

Brian:
 'Cause I love the strings of a classical score.

Stewie:
 And I like that singer who looks like a whore.

Brian:
 Ricky Martin?

Stewie:
 Love him.

 Brian:
 ? We're too different to ever be pals ?? You and I are ?

Locals:
 ? Dododo ?

 Brian:
 ? so awfully different ?

 Brian:
 ? Too awfully different ?

 Brian:
 ? to ever be pals ?

Locals:
 ? Dododo dodo dodo doooo dodo ?

Brian:
 ? Your head's as massive as a meteorite ?

Stewie:
 Oh, very funny. ? You have a weenie like a christmas tree light ?

Brian:
 ? I'd bet money, you'll marry a honey ? ? Whose pretty and funny ? ? And her name will be Ted ?

Stewie:
 Oh a gay joke.

Brian:
 I just work with what you give me.

 Brian:
 ? You might think we're in sync ? ? But we stink, as a duo ?

Brian:
 ? 'Cause you get a kick out of carnage and guts ?

Stewie:
 ? And you get a kick out of stroking your... ?

Brian:
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't say that on TV

Stewie:
 What? Ego?

Brian:
 Never mind.

 Brian:
 ? We're too different to ever be pals ?

Brian:
 Oh, man! We're screwed. We're lost in the desert, we have no food, no water, and our camel is dead from exhaustion.

Stewie:
 And I had named him and given him a back-story. Chucky had the biggest hump of the camels in his village. And he was picked on for it. But then there was a terrible drought and Chucky went to the oasis, because he was like that. He drank and drank, and stored enough water in his massive hump to slake the thirst of the entire...

Brian:
 Cut the maudlin crap. We're in trouble here. It's already below freezing, and it's getting colder. We're gonna die unless-unless we do something drastic.

Brian:
 We must slice open our camel's stomach and shelter ourselves in his entrails.

Stewie:
 Eviscerate Chucky? I won't do it!

Brian:
 Look, we're gonna die if we don't.

Stewie:
 All right. <Brian slices open camel> Oh, God! It's like Orson Welles' autopsy.

Brian:
 All right, just hold your breath and go. What are you doing?

Stewie:
 Wiping my feet. I don't want to track any sand inside. Once you get it in there, you can't get it out. Oh God! I just threw up in his lung!

Brian:
 Look, I know it's gross, but when you're desperate and you stare death in the face, you have no choice but to.... There's a Comfort Inn.

Brian:
 Yeah. Good luck for us, huh?

Stewie:
 You know, once you feng shui the organs, it's kind of cozy.

Lois:
 Oh, isn't this exciting?

Man:
 Anyone got a light? Thanks.

Lois:
 Peter, look, there's Dave and Dottie, the nudists.

Dave:
 Well, hey there, Griffins!

Lois:
 Dave, Dottie, what a pleasant surprise!

Dottie:
 Don't tell me you're KISS freaks, too?

Peter:
 KISS army soldier since 1977. How about you?

Dave:
 '76. I don't think anyone knows more about KISS than I do.

Peter:
 I'm sorry. What was that?

Lois:
 It's not important.

Peter:
 Let him answer, Lois!

Dave:
 I said, no one knows more about KISS than I do.

Dottie:
 Fellows, please keep it civil.

Peter:
 I'm not sure I like the tone of your voice, Dave.

Dave:
 Well, throw down, if that's what you want.

Peter:
 Name Gene Simmons' special-effects mentor.

Dave:
 Amazo the Magician. What high school did Paul Stanley go to?

Peter:
 New York High School of Music. Paul and Gene's band before KISS?

Dave:
 Wicked Lester. What year did KISS appear on the Jim Nabor's Halloween special?

Peter:
 Trick question. It was Paul Lynde, and it was 1975. Now recite the ad that brought Peter Criss to Paul and Gene's attention.

 Dave:
 "Drummer willing to do anything to make it." Rolling Stone, October, 1972.

Dave:
 Exemplary.

Peter:
 Rock 'n' roll!

Brian:
 How in the hell are we gonna get out of here?

Stewie:
 Are you going to finish your red paste?

Stewie:
 What about your sweet crusty thing?

Brian:
 No, you can have it.

Father:
 No more balloon for you. I am sick of you tooling around the village in it, honking at the girls, blasting your 1980s American rock music that we got here last week.

Son:
 But, Father...

Father:
 Go to your palace!

Brian:
 Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

Stewie:
 Oh, yes. Just wait until they have to suffer through Jesus Jones. [Makes a disgusted sound]

Brian:
 Not that, the balloon!

Stewie:
 Oh, yes. The balloon. Let's take it.

Brian:
 Wow! I didn't know it really looked like that.

Stewie:
 Neither did I. <the landscape below the balloon looks like an actual map> Such lovely printing, too.

KISS:
 ?You keep on shoutin', you keep on shoutin'?

Peter:
 Oh, Lois, here comes the best part.

KISS:
 ?I wanna rock and roll all night...?

Lois:
 "And have a wonderful time"

Lois:
 Is that it? Oh, no no. "And something, something all day" Right?

Gene Simmons:
 Oh, man! I've lost all faith in mankind.

Paul Stanley:
 Music is dead to me now.

Peter Criss:
 Hey, now's our chance!

Ace Frehley:
 Let's do it!

Stewie:
 I say! Where the hell are we?

Cardinal:
 Pope! Pope! It's time to get up and put on your hat.

Pope:
 It's a stupid hat!

Cardinal:
 Pope!

Pope:
 All right, okay. God!

Cardinal:
 Pope, the floor is not a hamper!

Pope:
 Man!

Cardinal:
 Good. Now it's time to go on the balcony and address the people.

Pope:
 [Speaking Latin] <the Pope is hit by the balloon and knocked onto a statue below> [Pope screaming]

Brian:
 All right, all we've got to do is find the American Embassy and they'll help us get home.

Stewie:
 Home? I have no intention of returning to that disgusting hovel with that intolerable woman, that fat slob, and that insufferable dog. Oh, you're right here, aren't you? Oh, well, I stand by it. My future is with Jolly Farm.

Brian:
 You really think that, don't you?

Stewie:
 I know it.

Brian:
 Okay, we've got three days until Peter and Lois get back from their KISS concerts. Let's go to Jolly Farm.

Stewie:
 Yeah, now you're talking!

Pope:
 You make the Pope look like a fool! God will make you pay. Smite them! He's cooking something up.

Stewie:
 I say! Brian, look. Three rows down.

Stewie:
 Is that Tom Bosley?

Brian:
 What would Tom Bosley be doing on a train in Switzerland?

Stewie:
 I'm almost certain. Tom! Did he look?

Brian:
 I don't know.

Stewie:
 If I yell, you have to watch. Tom Bosley!

Brian:
 No, it's not him.

Tour Guide:
 Besides its beautiful historic architecture Munich was the home of many great writers such as Thomas Mann. You will find more on Germany's contribution to the arts in the pamphlets we have provided.

Brian:
 Yeah, about your pamphlet. Uh, I'm not seeing anything about German history between 1939 and 1945. There's just a big gap.

Tour Guide:
 Everyone was on vacation! On your left is Munich's first city hall erected in 15...

Brian:
 Wait, wait. What are you talking about? Germany invaded Poland in 1939 and...

Tour Guide:
 We were invited! Punch was served! Check with Poland!

Brian:
 You can't just ignore those years. Thomas Mann fled to America because of Nazism's stranglehold on Germany.

Tour Guide:
 Nope. Nope. He left to manage a Dairy Queen.

Brian:
 A Dairy Queen? That's preposterous.

Tour Guide:
 I will hear no more insinuations about the German people! Nothing bad happened! [Yelling in German] <gives Nazi salute>

Brian:
 Uh, is that a beer hall?

Tour Guide:
 Oh, yes. Munich is renowned for its historic beer halls.

Lois:
 Why is everybody glaring at us?

Peter:
 Why, Lois? I'll tell you why. Your faux pas last night at the concert was so upsetting I had to call a university professor to tell me what phrase to use to describe it.

Professor:
 Use "faux pas."

Peter:
 Thanks, professor.

Peter:
 You've been living a lie all these years. You represented yourself as a KISS fan. And why? To make me look foolish!

Lois:
 No. To make you happy. I wanted to share in all aspects of your life, Peter. But I just was never that big a KISS fan.

Peter:
 I should've guessed that when you were willing to dress up as Peter Criss. No one wants to be Peter Criss, Lois! Not even Peter Criss!

Lois:
 I guess I'm just not as cool as you thought I was.

Peter:
 I guess not.

Brian:
 I'm exhausted. Come on. Let's get a coffee. <enters coffeehouse> The smoke is so acrid.

Stewie:
 A man can hardly breathe in here.

Pot Head:
 You should get some hash, man. You can't go wrong.

Stewie:
 Not true. Ground meat can go very wrong for me very quickly, and everyone in this room will suffer the consequences!

Pot Head:
 You are out there, man, in the ether.

Stewie:
 I'd love to further pursue our palaver but I am not fluent in "freak up"! So, I'm just gonna turn back over here, back towards my table.

Brian:
 Say, are you hungry?

Stewie:
 Well, you know, I wasn't when I came in. But isn't that so funny? I'm getting there.

Brian:
 Yeah. Same here.

Stewie:
 I think the only reason we die is that...

Brian:
 Dude, I know what you're gonna say. And I am so completely...

Stewie:
 Wait, wait, wait! Sh, sh, sh. The only reason we die is because we accept it as an inevitability. Hah.

Brian:
 Do you think I'll ever find the right woman?

Stewie:
 Oh, God! Yes, man! Come on! Dude, you're great!

Lois:
 Peter, are you ever gonna forgive me?

Peter:
 Lois, I am obligated to keep loving you, so I will take my rage out on my own body. Let's go to Denny's.

Peter:
 Oh, man! I don't believe it! KISS is here! We don't deserve to be under the same roof with them. Let's go.

Lois:
 All right. I guess I could fix us something when we...Chaim?

Peter:
 Lois! Do not address KISS unless they address you first!

Lois:
 Oh, my God! Chaim Witz? It is you.

Gene Simmons:
 Which one do you want me to sign? Left or right?

Lois:
 No, no, no. It's Lois. Lois Pewterschmidt. I knew you before you changed your name.

Gene Simmons:
 Lois! I don't believe it. It's been ages. Hey, guys, this is the girl I told you about. You know, I knew her before we formed KISS. "Loose" Lois!

Paul Stanley:
 Cool! "Loose" Lois!

Peter Kriss:
 The legend herself.

Ace Frehley:
 My Grand Slam was supposed to be with sausage.

Lois:
 I never realized you were Gene Simmons the rock star!

Gene Simmons:
 You look great, Lois. Anyone nailing you now?

Lois:
 Yes, my husband nails me. This is him, Peter.

Peter:
 You-are-gods!

Gene Simmons:
 Yeah, thanks, right. We're recording some tracks in Boston next month. You should come on by.

Lois:
 We'd love that, Chaim... I mean Gene, you big rock star. Bye! Wow! Such a small world. He was a nice boy. And he's still nice.

Peter:
 Listen, Lois, what I said before...I've never been more wrong in my life. You are the coolest girl in the world! My wife did KISS!

Lois:
 And J. Geils.

Lois:
 Nothing.

Stewie:
 There it is! The BBC! Well, this is it. I'll say good-bye to you now.

Brian:
 Well, have a good life, Stewie.

Stewie:
 Oh, I shall! Oh, hey, I meant to ask you did you find out what the button on my bureau was from?

Brian:
 Oh, yeah. Chris' denim jacket.

Stewie:
 Ah. I like that jacket. It looks good on him. Okay, then. So, we'll keep in touch?

Stewie:
 Well, I have your address. See ya! There's Happy Hill! <crashes into set wall> What the deuce? Pengrove! Pengrove Pig! Pengrove, I've come to live on Jolly Farm! Oh, my! The magic tome. But it's cardboard. And there are no words. There are just.... What is it you've drawn here?

Pengrove Pig:
 That's Oswald Owl slamming Mother Maggie in one of them Chinese baskets. <takes off pig head> Dead brill, eh?

Stewie:
 Ah! Mother Maggie! Thank God! Something's terribly wrong.

Mother Maggie:
 Whose stinky brat is this?

Stewie:
 What? That's not your voice. Your voice is lyrical, like the gentle strum of a lute.

Mother Maggie:
 Piss off, you grotty little wanker!

Stewie:
 It's a fake. It's not real.

Brian:
 I thought it'd be best for you to find out on your own, kid.

Stewie:
 I feel like such a fool. Don't even look at me!

Brian:
 Hey, come on. You want to get some ice cream? That'd make you feel better, right? You want to get some McDonald's? Do you want to take a dump in Mother Maggie's shoes? Okay. Let's go take a dump in Mother Maggie's shoes.

Meg:
 Jolly Farm is on, Stewie. Don't you want to watch?

Stewie:
 The Stewie who loved Jolly Farm is dead, Megan. Meet the Stewie who loves funky fruit hats! [Humming tropical music]

Meg:
 Turn it up! Mom and Dad are on!

Moderator:
 We're back with more KISS Forum. I'm with the Griffins. They got something really exciting to share.

Peter:
 Yeah. My wife here did KISS.

Moderator:
 Get out of here!

Lois:
 Hand to God.

Moderator:
 Peter! How does that make you feel?

Peter:
 I feel like I've done KISS, too, Donny. And it feels good.

Moderator:
 Lois, you got any tips for the young girls in the audience tonight?

Lois:
 Well, I guess the best advice I can give is that you never know who's gonna grow up to be famous. So, just make yourself available.

Moderator:
 Cool. Cool. Well, that's our show for tonight. Now stay tuned for Battlestar Galactica Forum. <dons Cylon helmet> Welcome to Battlestar Galactica Forum

Brian:
 Hi, I'm Brian Griffin.

Stewie:
 And I'm Stewart.

Brian:
: Many of you have written to the show with suggestions for episodes you'd like to see.

Stewie:
 They're mostly God-awful.

Brian:
: Well, tonight we took your advice and produced three of our favorite suggestions.

Stewie:
 Favorites? Oh, that's charitable.

Brian:
 What is that?

Stewie:
 I got this from 'Dharma and Greg'.

Brian:
 I'm surprised there's anything left in it.

BOTH:
 Whoa!

Brian:
 Enjoy.

Title card:
 No Bones About It>

Announcer:
 And now back to The Newlywed Game.

Host:
 Carol, how did Nick answer the following: the last thing I would ever give my wife is 'blank'?"

Wife:
 A little spending money?

Host:
 I'm sorry, that's incorrect. Nick actually said "the antidote."

Wife:
 Nick, what are you talking about?

Lois:
 Oh, Meg, you were right.

Peter:
 Oh, my God! A genie!

Genie:
 I am here to grant you three wishes.

Lois:
 Peter, three wishes! Oh, this is so exciting!

Meg:
 I want a new hat!

Chris:
 I want a new hat!

Stewie:
 I want them to have new hats!

Lois:
 Kids, these are your father's wishes. Go ahead, honey. Get whatever you want.

Peter:
 That's easy. I wish I could see what Kelly Ripa was like off the set.

Genie:
 So it shall be.

Regis Philbin:
 Great show today, Kelly.

Kelly Ripa:
 Thanks, Reg. You, too.

Regis Philbin:
 Kelly, Gelman needs us on stage for a couple of re-shoots.

Kelly Ripa:
 Be right there, Reg. I just have to put on my face.

Lois:
 My goodness! Did you see the size of that dressing room?

Peter:
 Yes. They must really want to keep her.

Genie:
 Your second wish?

Peter:
 I got just the thing. I wish I had my own theme music.

Genie:
 Done!

Peter:
 I don't hear anything.

Genie:
 Get up. Try it out.

Peter:
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[on a bus] Man:
 Hey, buddy, want to turn that stuff down?

Peter:
 Come on, pal. That's classic traveling music. Try to enjoy it.

Peter:
 ?Riding on a bus? ?Riding on a bus? ?Sitting next to bums? ?There's an open seat? ?Hope that isn't pee?

Man:
 Yeah! I'm sick of hearing it!

Peter:
 Look, I'm sorry, buddy. I can't turn it off.

Man:
 Well, then I'm gonna break every bone in your body.

Peter:
 I wish I had no bones!

Genie:
 Done.

Peter:
 That ought to show you!

Peter:
 Oh, no. I got to fart. But I don't know which way to lean.

Peter:
 I know you might be a little concerned about me not having bones and all. But I got to tell you, it's not that bad.

Chris:
 Dad's just like Silly Putty. Look what I can do to Mary Worth's smug sense of self-satisfaction.

Peter:
 That's right, son. Take her down a peg.

Lois:
 Well, I guess we could all adjust to this.

Stewie:
 Look! I'm making an angel!

Peter:
 See, Lois? Everything's gonna be fine.

Stewie:
 Now, smile while I write my name in you.

Peter:
 Let go!

Peter:
 [Peter screaming]

Meg:
 But, Mom, I've got to use the bathroom now!

Lois:
 I'm sorry, but your father gets incredibly filthy rolling around everywhere. (Peter is in the bathtub) (from outside) He just has to take his 12 baths a day.

Chris:
 I don't like Dad anymore! I invited some friends over to jump on him like a trampoline but his roll of fat sucked up Ryan's shoe! And his mom yelled at him when he got home! And he beat me up at school the next day! It's all here in this pamphlet.

Lois:
 Kids, we just have to learn to accept this. Like one of those stories on Dateline where a family member suffers a horrible accident and becomes a burden on everybody. Sure they pretend to be happy, but they're dead inside. They're dead. And that'll be our lives. Hmmm?

Peter:
 What a big, boneless jerk I am! I might have screwed up my life but there's no reason I got to keep screwing up theirs. Good-bye, cruel, bone-filled world!

Peter:
 [yelling]

Peter:
 Oh, so this is where all the waste and sewage winds up.

Director:
 Cut and print. That's a wrap. Great job, Peter. Coming to the wrap party tonight?

Peter:
 Gee, I don't know. I got a standup comedy class I'm taking at The Learning Annex. Actually, I won't be a standup comic, I'll be more like an amorphous-blob comic. I gotta write that one down!

Director:
 Nonsense! I'll have the studio send a flatbed for you! See you at 8:00!

Jones:
 Peter, there's something I've been wanting to say to you all evening.

Peter:
 What's that, Mrs. Catherine Zeta-Jones-Douglas?

Jones:
 I want to jump your non-bones.

Peter:
 Jeez! I can't believe I'm your type.

Jones:
 Well, as you can tell from my husband, I've got a thing for saggy, shapeless men.

Michael Douglas:
 I'm married to Catherine Zeta-Jones. Will you sleep with me?

Peter:
 Yeah, I'm gonna have to pass. But Louie Anderson's eating the decorative soaps in the bathroom. Why don't you try him?

Doctor:
': Excuse me. Aren't you Peter, the human stunt bag?

Peter:
 That all depends on who's asking.

Doctor:
 I'm a doctor, conducting an experimental procedure to give bones to a jellyfish. I'd like to try it on a human first. Interested?

Peter:
 I don't know.

Doctor:
 Interested?

Peter:
 Did you just say that?

Doctor:
 Yes.

Doctor:
 Well, Peter, the operation was a complete success! What are you going to do now?

Peter:
 The whole reason I had the operation was so I could go back to my family. But it's been so long. What if they don't love me anymore?

Doctor:
 Peter, where do you think all those bones came from?

Lois:
 Surprise!

Peter:
 My God! You mean, it's your bones that are inside me?

Stewie:
 Well, mostly. We picked up a drifter to fill in the torso.

Lois:
 Well, like I always say, a family of freaks is better than no family at all!

Peter:
 Let's go home. You know what's really weird? This was covered by my HMO.

Title card:
 Supergriffins>

The Count:
Six! Six bats! Seven! Seven bats!

Peter:
 Hey, is the Count a vampire?

Brian:
 What's that?

Peter:
 Well, he's got those big fangs. Have they ever shown him doing somebody in and then feeding on him?

Lois:
 Everybody come quick! There's something in the yard!

Meg:
 It looks like the back of a tanker truck.

Peter:
 Wow! What do you think's inside?

Chris:
 Maybe it's candy!

Lois:
 Chris, no!

Peter:
 Lois, Lois, let him dream.

Meg:
 What is this stuff?

Brian:
 It's some kind of nuclear waste.

Stewie:
 Tell me, does anyone else feel a trifle queasy?

Stewie:
 What? Do I have a boogie? I say, it appears my cranium has doubled in size! How delightful! This toxic stew seems to have given me telekinetic abilities.

Chris:
 Hey, I can make fire!

Peter:
 Chris, come here a second. This is gonna be hilarious. Okay, on the count of three. One, two, three.

Stewie:
 Do it again!

Lois:
 All right, everyone. Clearly, something very strange has happened here. We each seem to have acquired superpowers from that nuclear waste. We've been given a gift. And whether that gift is Chris' fire conjuring, Stewie's telekinesis, Brian's super-speed...

Brian:
 Ask how the Queen of England is.

Lois:
 How's the Queen...

Brian:
 She's great.

Lois:
 Peter's morphing ability...

Peter:
 Hey, Lois, I'm a wishing troll.

Lois:
 ...my super strength, or Meg's super-amazing ability to grow her fingernails...

Lois:
 ...we have a responsibility to use these powers properly and not to abuse them for personal gain. Understand?

Brian:
 Yes.

Chris:
 Yep.

Lois:
 Oh, no. I forgot the detergent. Excuse me, would you watch him for a moment?

Clerk:
 Sure thing, ma'am. Whoa there, little guy. You got to pay for that.

Stewie:
 Go suck a railroad spike. I haven't got any money.

Clerk:
 Well, then I am afraid I am gonna have to take it away from you. [Screaming] Oh, God! Please help me!

Lois:
 Move it, you slowpoke! The light's green!

Man:
 What does that cloud look like to you, honey? To me it looks like rain! Ha! I used that joke at work. I'm the funniest guy at the office. They say I should do standup.

Lois:
 This is insane!

Meg:
 Oh, my God, Dad! *NSYNC is in town. If you can get me a lock of Justin's hair I'll never ask you for shopping money again. Please?

Peter:
 We promised Lois we'd use our powers responsibly. But I suppose doing the exact opposite couldn't hurt.

Peter:
 All right, Meg, wait here. I'll be right back.

Peter:
 Hi there. Britney Spears. You mind if I go in?

Security Guard:
 Not at all, Miss Spears.

Peter:
 Call me Peter. Hey there, fellas.

Justin Timberlake:
 Britney? What are you doing here?

Peter:
 Oh, you know, I was just in the neighborhood-I'm gonna steal one of your beers-and figured I'd stop by and say hi. You mind if I have a seat?

Peter:
 I am out of shape. Say, Justin, I got a favor to ask you.

Justin Timberlake:
 What is it?

Peter:
 I got a hole in my muffler and I need something to plug it with.

Peter:
 Can I have some of your hair?

Justin Timberlake:
 Um, I guess so.

Peter:
 Great. Thanks. All right, hold still now. You'll be fine. Hey, come here. Give me a kiss. [transforms into Gene Shalit] I'm Gene Shalit now! Bye!

Bartender:
 Here's your martini, ma'am.

Woman:
 Thanks. Hey, it's gone!

Bartender:
 Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am. Here's another one.

Woman:
 What the hell is going on here?

Brian:
 Hi. Can I get some pretzels or something? I got to drive. Did you bring enough breasts for the rest of the class? Ha-ha-ha!

Chris:
 Hey, Hector, how long have we known each other?

Hector:
 Since first grade.

Chris:
 Yeah, yeah. You remember that time you called me "Chris Gristle"?

Hector:
 I think so.

Chris:
 Well, burn for it!

Hector:
 [Screaming]

Tom Tucker:
 It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a lower-middle-class Irish family.

Diane Simmons:
 That's right, Tom. This is one of many public disturbances caused by the Griffin family of Quahog who seem to have acquired superpowers.

Tom Tucker:
 Very strange story, Diane. Coming up next, can bees think? A new study confirms that, no, they cannot.

Mayor West:
 Citizens of Quahog, we have a problem!

Justin Timberlake:
 You're damn right we do! Peter Griffin stole my hair!

Mayor West:
 Settle down, Jeffrey!

Justin Timberlake:
 Justin.

Mayor West:
 Mike. Clearly, the Griffin family is out of control. But not to fear. I've tangled with super-beings before. And they can be stopped!

Peter:
 You can't stop us, Mayor West! We are all-powerful!

Mayor West:
 Clearly, you've let yourselves become drunk with power.

Chris:
 We demand obedience!

Meg:
 Or else!

Man:
 Is that all you can do? [Meg scrapes him with nails] That kind of hurt! Is that bleeding? I guess it's all right. Ouch, though.

Peter:
 Anyone who opposes our demands will be destroyed. Our first demand: you will erect a statue in the town square. This statue will depict Blair Warner admitting to Mrs. Garrett that the poem she submitted for her creative-writing class was actually plagiarized from a work by Emily Dickinson. We have spoken!

Mayor West:
 That's it! We have to fight fire with fire. If nuclear refuse gave them superpowers, it could do the same for me. Citizens, I'm off to the toxic waste dump!

 Hartman:
 Mayor West, you have lymphoma.

Mayor West:
 Oh, my!

 Hartman:
 Probably from rolling around in that toxic waste.

Mayor West:
 I see.

 Hartman:
 What in God's name were you trying to prove?

Mayor West:
 I was trying to gain superpowers.

 Hartman:
 Well, that's just silly.

Mayor West:
 Silly, yes. Idiotic, yes.

Peter:
 No, no! That's not what Mrs. Garrett's bosom looked like. It looked more like this. [Peter transforms himself into Mrs' Garrett's cleavage] Notice the sun spots at the top of the right can.

Woman:
 Excuse me. I have a message from the Quahog Hospital.

Peter:
 I just feel awful about this, Mayor West.

Lois:
 Yeah. Me, too. Stewie, fluff his pillows.

Chris:
 I'll heat up his soup.

Brian:
 And I'll go to China to see if there's a cure. [leaves and returns with one of those conical straw hats] Nope.

Mayor West:
 Now, now. The doctor says I'm gonna make a full recovery. The important thing is, you learned your lesson.

Lois:
 I can't believe we let those superpowers go to our heads.

Stewie:
 I feel like such a bastard.

Brian:
 Me, too.

Peter:
 For now, we are gonna use our powers to help you get better.

Mayor West:
 Thank you. But as long as I have Mrs. Garrett's giant rack by my bedside, I'll be all right.

Peter:
 Girls! Girls! Girls! [Laughing]

Title card:
 Li'l Griffins>

Peter:
 Hear ye, hear ye. I call to order the first meeting of the We Hate Broads Club.

ALL:
 Yeah!

Brian:
 Because all you need in life is your best pals.

Quagmire:
 Sure! As long as those pals ain't dames!

Cleveland:
 O-tay!

Peter:
 What was that?

Quagmire:
 Hey, I thought we told you guys to quit snooping around here!

Tom Tucker:
 We need to find a story if I'm ever gonna be a big-time reporter, man.

Peter:
 All right, all right. Make like Siamese twins and split...and then one of you die.

Mayor West:
 When do we have the grape juice? I came for the grape juice.

Peter:
 Hey, Quagmire, watch this.

Teacher:
Hey, "kick me"!

Teacher:
 Boys and girls, we have a new student joining us this morning. Her name is Lois Pewterschmidt.

Peter:
 Just what we need, another girl.

Quagmire:
 You said it!

Peter:
 Wow, I'd like to play doctor with her and remove her inflamed appendix before it bursts, causing sepsis.

Quagmire:
 Gigidy-gigidy-gigidy! [Alfalfa-style cowlick straightens out]

Peter:
 Hey, Lois, what you reading?

Lois:
 'The Red Badge of Courage.' I sure wish I could meet a brave fellow like the guy in this book.

Peter:
 I'm a brave guy, Lois.

Quagmire:
 Oh, yeah? I bet you're not brave enough to laugh at Death!

Peter:
 Watch me. Ha-ha-ha!

Death:
 Oh, thanks! Like I don't have enough trouble fitting in!

Peter:
 I bet you're not brave enough to take all your clothes off!

Quagmire:
 Way ahead of you. Oh!

Peter:
 Well, I bet you're too chicken to spend a night at the old Selberg place.

Peter:
 Uh, Cleveland, you mind stepping out of the way?

Cleveland:
 Oh, sorry.

Quagmire:
 Well, I ain't chicken to spend the night there!

Peter:
 Well, I ain't neither! And to prove it, I'm going up there tonight!

Quagmire:
 See you there, pal!

Mort Goldman:
 You can't stay in that house! Old Man Selberg's ghost still haunts it. Not to mention the myriad of bacteria and allergens from years of substandard housekeeping. It does not augur well for you.

Peter:
 Aw, Zip it, egghead. You with your big words and your small, difficult words.

Lois:
 Wow. Any boy who would spend the night in that creepy place sure would be the bravest fellow I ever met.

Peter:
 That Lois is some kind of woman. Quagmire: Yeah. Just thinking about her makes my testicles want to drop. Oops! Speak of the devil. Oop, make that devils.

Joe:
 All right. Quagmire's team will take the left side of the house. Peter's team will take the right. And whoever's alive in the morning can bury his dead pals.

Cleveland:
 Do I have a cobweb in my hair? It feels like I have a cobweb in my hair.

Cleveland:
 What was that?

Quagmire:
 It's just Michael Winslow from Police Academy.

Michael Winslow:
 [Growling] [Monkey noise] [Helicopter noise] [Elephant noise] [Baaing like a sheep] [Submarine noise]

Joe:
 This house gives me the creeps.

Brian:
 Yeah. Let's get out of here.

Peter:
 Wait, wait, wait. We can't let those guys win. What we ought to do is pretend we're ghosts, see-

Quagmire:
 -and then we'll scare the other guys out of the house-

Peter:
 -then we can say that we spent-

Quagmire:
 -the-

Peter:
 -night. Then, everyone will think we're-

Peter:
 -bravest kids in the world. Especially Lois.

Peter:
 Hey, I got a great idea! <gets into suit of armor> This'll really scare them. Everybody set?

Joe:
 Check!

Brian:
 Check!

Goldie Hawn:
 Sock it to me!

Mayor West:
 If we only had a teacup, this'd be like playing Find the Teacup in the Bed Sheet, like I do with my Aunt Sophia.

Peter:
 My God! Not only are ghosts real, but their innards are made of children.

Quagmire:
 Peter, it's us!

Peter:
 Say, that's a nice effect.

Quagmire:
 Yeah. That's really scary.

Peter:
 Wait a second. If you're there, and I'm here and Istanbul is somewhere in this general area then who the hell is that?

Tom Tucker:
 Ha-Get used to this sight, Diane. Guys running away from you.

Diane Simmons:
 Tom, you're so deep in the closet, you're finding Christmas presents.

Peter:
 All right. Now, remember our story. We tell Lois that we both stayed all night. I caught the ghost with my lasso.

Quagmire:
 And I punched him so hard, he ran crying all the way back to Hell!

Peter:
 She'll have to believe that. It hangs together so perfectly.

Diane Simmons:
 Our top story today, cowardly kids lay down rubber at the old Selberg place.

Peter:
 Wait. Turn that up.

Tom Tucker:
 Peter Griffin and Glen Quagmire were seen bolting <gets louder> were seen bolting out of the supposedly haunted house after just one half-hour leaving only their pride and twin trails of urine behind them.

Quagmire:
 Cheese and crackers! Now Lois'll know everything!

Peter:
 Not if I can help it!

Tom Tucker:
 Newsroom.

Peter:
 Hello. This is Peter Griffin. You'd better stop saying that stuff or we'll watch something else!

Girl:
 <in Barbara Walters-like voice> Today on The View, cooties, the silent killer.

Peter:
 Lois? There's something we got to tell you.

Quagmire:
 Yeah. We didn't stay in the haunted house. We're not brave.

Lois:
 Oh, I've decided I don't care about bravery.

Peter and Quagmire:
 You don't?

Lois:
 No. I realized what I really like is smarts.

Mort Goldman:
 Sorry I'm late, darling. I was checking my stool for blood.

Peter and Quagmire:
 Mort Goldman!

Lois:
 He's so clever! Show them, Morty!

Peter:
 He got us again!

Quagmire:
 This whole thing just shows that women are nothing but trouble!

Peter:
 You said it! Let's you and me swear off them for good!

Quagmire:
 And how!

Peter:
 I say, Quagmire, it seems to me we've each made another $500 million.

Quagmire:
 Good thing we swore off women so we wouldn't be distracted and unable to accumulate this vast amount of wealth.

Peter:
 Yes. You watch the ticker. I'm gonna microwave a bagel and have sex with it.

Chris:
 Dad, can you help me with my math? Mr. Shackleford says if I don't learn it, I won't function in the real world.

Man:
 What you gotta do is go down the road past the old Johnson place. You're gonna find two roads, one parallel and one perpendicular. Keep going until you come to a highway that bisects it at a 45 degree angle. Solve for x.

Chris:
 [lies on ground and sucks thumb]

Jim Kaplan:
 Hello, sir.

Peter:
 Enough with the foreplay, sailor. What are you selling?

Jim Kaplan:
 Well, I was gonna try to sell you some "handsome cream" but I can see you already bought out the store!

Jim Kaplan:
 Perhaps you'd be interested in something every homeowner cannot be without. Volcano insurance!

Jim Kaplan:
 According to my uncle-who's a real whiz with volcanoes-a volcano is coming this way!

Peter:
 [Thinking] I, too, have an uncle.

Peter:
 Come in.

Peter:
 How much is this volcano insurance?

Jim Kaplan:
 Uh, I don't know. Let's say, $200.

Peter:
 $200? That's more than I spent on all that handsome cream.

Peter:
 I don't have that kind of money!

Jim Kaplan:
 What about that jar of money?

Peter:
 No way! That's Lois' rainy day fund.

Jim Kaplan:
 Ah, come on, it never rains in Rhode Island.

Peter:
 Yeah, but I'm pretty sure we've never had a volcano either.

Jim Kaplan:
 Well, don't you think we're overdue for one?

Peter:
 TouchÃ©, salesman.

Stewie:
 [snoring, then gasping awake]

Stewie:
 Ah! What the hell are you doing?

Meg:
 Watching you sleep, cutie pie.

Stewie:
 Why you sick, sick little moo cow. Well, you shall watch no more! [smashes Meg's glasses]

Meg:
 My glasses! I can't see a thing without my glasses! Why won't you let me get laser surgery?

Lois:
 Because I don't think it's safe.

Luke Skywalker:
 Okay, I just need to make a quick incision here and we should be all done, Mrs. Wilson.

Wan Kenobi:
 Luke, use the Force.

Luke Skywalker:
 Really? 'Cause I was just gonna make...

Wan Kenobi:
 Use-use the Force.

Luke Skywalker:
 Okay!

Woman:
 [Screaming]

Luke Skywalker:
 Are you happy?

Wan Kenobi:
 I've never been happy.

Lois:
 Don't worry, honey. We'll get you a new pair tomorrow.

Stewie:
 In the meantime, here's a little vision test. What is this? A poopie or a Toblerone?

Announcer:
 We now return to "Girlfriends" on Lifetime.

BOTH:
 He left the toilet seat up!

BOTH:
 Commitment!

Announcer:
Lifetime, television for idiots.

Lois:
 Peter, did you take the money from the family jar?

Peter:
 Who, me? Yes, me. Couldn't be. Then who? Yeah, I did it. I bought us volcano insurance.

Lois:
 Volcano insurance? That's ridiculous.

Peter:
 That's the same thing you said when you talked me out of cloud insurance.

Peter:
 Look at them up there just plottin', pickin' their moment.

Lois:
 That was our emergency money and your daughter needs a new pair of glasses.

Peter:
 Lois, no one really needs glasses.

Lois:
 You wear glasses.

Peter:
 That's only to fool the man from the draft board.

Lois:
 I can't believe you squandered that money! I swear, sometimes I feel like I'm married to a child.

Peter:
 What can I say about my beautiful bride except milk, milk, lemonade. Around the corner, fudge is made!

Peter:
 You better watch who you call a child, Lois. Because if I'm a child, then you know what that makes you? A pedophile! And I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here and be lectured by a pervert!

Peter:
 Can you believe it, Cleveland? Lois thinks I'm bad with money.

Cleveland:
 She's got a point, Peter. You're the white version of a black guy who's not good with his money.

Quagmire:
 Hey, guys and dolls! Drinks are on do-re-me! [slams wad of cash on bar]

Peter:
 Where'd you get that?

Quagmire:
 This loot's thanks to my stockbroker, lan Greenstein. He made some smart investments that really paid off. That guy is to money what Miss Ann-Margaret is to...[Makes squeaky bed noises; then chair collapses]

Cleveland:
 Let me buy the drinks, Quagmire. My accountant, Larry Rosenblat, just got me a huge tax refund and tickets to "Bring In 'Da Noise, Bring In 'Da Funk". The noise was good, but I thought they phoned in a lot of the funk.

Peter:
 Wait a second. Rosenblat? Greenstein? So I need a Jewish guy to handle my money?

Cleveland:
 Peter, not every Jewish person is good with money.

Peter:
 Well, yeah, I guess not the retarded ones. But why would you even say that? For shock value? Jeez, Cleveland, there's "edgy" and there's "offensive." Good day, sir!

Lois:
 Mother, you know how I hate asking for money, but...Mother, Peter's an excellent provider...No, Mother, I do not think I'd be better off married to a chimp...I don't care how well that chimp across the street is doing...Really?...Well, yeah, okay. I guess you can tell him I said hi. But don't make me sound desperate!

Peter:
 I gotta get a Greenstein or a Rosenblat of my very own.

Peter:
 â™ªNothing else has worked so farâ™ª â™ªSo I'll wish upon a starâ™ª â™ªWondrous dancing speck of lightâ™ª â™ªI need a Jewâ™ª â™ªLois makes me take the rapâ™ª â™ªbecause our checkbook looks like crapâ™ª â™ªSince I can't give her a slapâ™ª â™ªI need a Jewâ™ª â™ªWhere to findâ™ª â™ªa Baum, or Stein, or Steinâ™ª â™ªto teach me how to whine and do my taxesâ™ª

Max Weinstein:
 Hi. My name's Max Weinstein. My car just broke down. May I use your phone?

Peter:
 â™ªNow my troubles are all throughâ™ª â™ªI have a Jew.â™ª

Max Weinstein:
 Hey!

Peter:
 I prayed for you, Max Weinstein, and here you are.

Max Weinstein:
 Okay. Listen, uh, thanks for letting me use the phone.

Peter:
 Thanks for Spaceballs.

Max Weinstein:
 If there's anything I can do for you...

Peter:
 You can't leave!

Max Weinstein:
 What do you want?

Max Weinstein:
 Financial advice? How the Hell did you know I'm an accountant?

Peter:
 Hello! 'Max Weinstein'?

Max Weinstein:
 Look, I'll do what I can, but I don't know why you think I can get your money back.

Peter:
 Max, Max, Max-let's not deny our heritages. You're Jewish, you're good with money. I'm Irish, I drink, and I ban homosexuals from marching in my parade. Now, help me get my money back.

Jim Kaplan:
 Oh, it's you. [Stammering] I'm not in right now. Please leave a message. Beep!

Peter:
 Man, I hate these things. Yeah, hi, this is Peter Griffin. I'm sorry I missed you-

Max Weinstein:
 Play with this. Sir, I have reviewed this contract, and it offers no coverage at all. It just says "volcano insurance" over and over again and down here in small print it says: "He's signing it. He's signing it. I can't believe it."

Jim Kaplan:
 So?

Max Weinstein:
 Refund his money and we'll go.

Jim Kaplan:
 I don't have your money!

Max Weinstein:
 How about that money?

Jim Kaplan:
 No way! That's Lois' rainy day fund!...Damn it!

Jerry Seinfeld:
 You couldn't date her because she was a tickler.

George Costanza:
 A tickler.

Jerry Seinfeld:
 You're not a stickler for a tickler.

George Costanza:
 Not a stickler for a tickler.

Jerry Seinfeld:
 Not a tickler stickler.

George Costanza:
 Not a tickler stickler.

BOTH:
 [Absurd babbling]

Brian:
 Where the hell is the remote?

Peter:
 Hey, honey, guess what? I got back the money for Meg's glasses.

Lois:
 Really? Oh, honey! Hello.

Peter:
 This is my special friend, Max Weinstein. He's Jewish.

Lois:
 Oh my, how exotic.

Max Weinstein:
 Thank you?

Peter:
 See, here's your rainy day money and I balanced our checkbook, too.

Lois:
 You balanced our checkbook?

Peter:
 Yep. Isn't that right, Max?

Max Weinstein:
 Yeah, sure. He did it.

Lois:
 I'll going to go call my mother right now and tell her to tell that chimp across the street [shrieks like a chimpanzee].

Peter:
 Look how low I've sunk-taking credit for something a smart Jewish person did.

Max Weinstein:
 That's okay, Peter.

Peter:
 No. People have been doing that for too damn long.

Civil Rights Speaker:
 It is the white devil that has propagated, exacerbated, instigated, instigated.... Line!

Woody Allen:
 "Instigated our hatred like a Buick." What was I thinking when I agreed to this? This is so degrading. This is worse than the time I was at the Friars' Club and Soon-Yi's retainer fell out of my pants.

Max Weinstein:
 Lois, I appreciate the marshmallow and fish casserole, but I'm sorry, I can't eat this.

Lois:
 Oh, because it's not kosher.

Max Weinstein:
 Yeah, let's go with that.

Chris:
 Can Stewie and me be excused? He's gonna help me with my math homework.

Lois:
 Chris, he's just a baby.

Stewie:
 Oh, and you're a regular Rhodes scholar. Where was it you graduated from again? The University of Duh?

Max Weinstein:
 I can help you with your homework, son.

Peter:
 My God! Is there nothing you people can't do? I mean, y'know, other than manual labor.

Lois:
 Peter, what a ridiculous thing to say! They built the pyramids. You'll have to excuse Peter. He can be a little tactless sometimes.

Brian:
 Yes, like the time he soiled himself at that dinner party?

 Lois:
 I was so sorry to hear that your father passed away.

Woman:
 Yes. It spread through his body so fast. But he's at peace now and the whole...

Peter:
 Uh-oh!

Peter:
 Well, there's only one thing that'll top a great dinner like that. Operation!

Lois:
 May I play?

KIDS:
 Mom!

Max Weinstein:
 Thank you, but I can't stay. It's Friday, I've got to go to Temple.

Peter:
 Temple? Like Indiana Jones?

Ralph Kramden:
 Will you just pick it up already!

Peter:
 They better not be expecting us to give money 'cause I already gave at church last Sunday, and I'm pretty sure it all goes to the same God.

Lois:
 Peter! Max, it was nice of you to invite us along.

Max Weinstein:
 Your husband's got a good heart, Lois, but his views on Judaism are a little misguided. I'd consider it a mitzvah to educate him a little.

Stewie:
 No. I don't think so. It's not that I have ideological differences, I'm just not a hat person.

Peter:
 Hey, look! I didn't know the principal of Meg's school was Jewish. Hey, there's Bill Nye, the Science Guy and half of Lenny Kravitz. Optimus Prime? He's Jewish?

Peter:
 Jeez, Max, I don't know about this. I went to Catholic school. I'm not sure this is allowed. Ah, what the hell?

Penguin:
 Excellent, excellent!

Woman:
 Hello.

Lois:
 We're not Jewish. But I hear you people have such lovely services. Oh, my God! I didn't mean "you people." I didn't mean "Oh, MY God," either. I know he's your God, too. [Nervous laughter]

Woman:
 [Shushing]

Rabbi:
: And on this day, the Sabbath we gather here to...

Lois:
 Well, that was so nice. A good sermon and such beautiful songs.

Peter:
 Yeah, it was just like that other Jewish musical we saw.

William Shatner:
 A fiddler on the roof sounds crazy, no? But here in our little village of Anatevka, you might say each one of us...

William Shatner:
 Kahn! Kahn!

Max Weinstein:
 Well, there's my cab. It was nice meeting all of you.

Peter:
 Thanks for everything, buddy.

Chris:
 Wait. I thought you were gonna help me with my homework.

Max Weinstein:
 I'm sorry, son. I have to go. But, I'm sure you'll do just fine.

Peter:
 I don't know, Max, the kid's not exactly an honor roll student. Watch. [hits Chris]

Chris:
 Hey!

Peter:
 He did it. [points to lamp]

Peter:
 See?

Max Weinstein:
 Peter, you took me in, fed me dinner, came to Temple with me. You're a nice family. I have faith that Chris will grow up to be a real mensch.

Peter:
 Lois, I just figured out how to make sure Chris becomes a big success.

Lois:
 Tell me this doesn't have anything to do with Tony Robbins.

Peter:
 No, I learned my lesson.

Peter:
 Could you sign this book, please?

Tony Robbins:
 Tony Robbins hungry! [Growling, swallows Peter]

Peter:
 No, Lois, I'm gonna make Chris Jewish!

Lois:
 What are you talking about?

Brian:
 He thinks if Chris is Jewish, he'll become smart.

Lois:
 Peter, you can't convert someone because you think it'll help their grades. Now I don't want to hear another word about this.

Peter:
 [signing] She won't have to hear another word, because luckily we've mastered American sign language.

Chris:
 [signing] Ha-ha-ha-ha!

Chris:
 Where are we going?

Peter:
 Son, it's too late for me, and Meg's a girl, but for you, the sky's the limit. We're gonna take you down to that synagogue and turn you Jewish!

Chris:
 Okay!

Peter:
 Chris, duck!

Rabbi:
 [Sighing] Mr. Griffin, I still don't understand. Why exactly does your son want to join the Jewish faith?

Peter:
 Heck, I don't know. He's bi-curious.

Rabbi:
 I appreciate your interest, but Judaism takes a serious commitment. Elliott here has spent years preparing for his bar mitzvah this Saturday.

Peter:
 A bar mitzvah! Perfect. How much for one of those?

Rabbi:
 You can't just buy a bar mitzvah. It requires a lot of study.

Peter:
 Can't we skip that part? I mean, c'mon, if Chris knew how to study, he wouldn't need to become Jewish, right? Right? Right?

Chris:
 Don't worry, Dad. I don't need a bar mitzvah. I'm okay just the way I...[screaming, as head is caught in car window]

Peter:
 We got no time to lose. There's gotta be someplace in America where you can take a solemn spiritual ceremony that begins a lifetime commitment and blow through it in about 20 minutes.

Meg:
 So, how do I look in my new glasses?

Stewie:
 How shall I put this? In an attic somewhere there's a portrait of you getting prettier.

Lois:
 Wow, someone needs a nap. After lunch it's straight to bed, Stewie.

Stewie:
 This isn't the first time my wit has gone unappreciated.

Ed McMahon:
 And in the comedy competition, Stewie Griffin receives three and a half stars. Challenger Sinbad receives four stars! We have a new champion, Sinbad! Stewie, any parting words?

Stewie:
 Um, you know, I got beat, pure and simple. You-you are a very funny man! "Men be acting all like zombies at the mall." God, ain't that the truth?

Lois:
 Where's your father and Chris? It's not like them to be late for lunch.

Meg:
 I think they left a note.

Brian:
 [chuckles]

Lois:
 Brian, what do you know about this?

Brian:
 Nothing.

Lois:
 I know when you're lying to me, Brian.

Brian:
 No, I swear.

Brian:
 What-What are you doing?

Lois:
 Oh, you don't know that, either? Last chance, Brian.

Brian:
 [yelps] They're in Vegas getting a quickie bar mitzvah!

Quagmire:
 Well, hel-Lois! Forgive me for pointing.

Lois:
 Quick, I need to borrow your car! I've got a bar mitzvah to stop!

Quagmire:
 No problem. Let me grab my keys. [lengthy crotch-level grabbing] Here they are.

Peter:
 Chris, in a few minutes, you'll become a smart, successful Jewish man. I could make a foreskin joke right now, but this is a solemn occasion. And, besides, there'll be plenty of time for that on the ride back. I got so many of them, too! I know, I know, shh, shh. But later!

Chris:
 ×‘×¨×›×• ×?×ª ×”' ×”×z×‘×•×¨×š (Hebrew: Cherish God the cherished)

Lois:
 Chris! [Banging] [yelling]

Lois:
 Stop this travesty right now!

Woman:
 Bar mitzvahs are travesties, huh?

Lois:
 No, my son getting bar mitzvahed is a travesty. He's doing it for all the wrong reasons.

Mordecai:
 Well, look-a-here, Herschel. We got us one of them self-hating Jews.

Herschel:
 Nothing I hate worse than a Jew who doesn't appreciate her own rich heritage. Come on, Mordecai. Let's get her!

Peter:
 I'm sorry, Lois. I just wanted our son to be Jewish so he'd be smarter. Then maybe his wife wouldn't be sorry she didn't marry the chimp next door.

Lois:
 Oh, Peter, just because Steven makes more money than you doesn't mean he's any smarter. And I think Chris will do just fine.

Peter:
 How do you know that?

Lois:
 Because I have faith in him, the way I have faith in you. Besides, a person's religion is no guarantee of success.

Peter:
 I see what you're saying. The Jewish are just like us. No better, no worse.

Chris:
 Yeah, and as they say...[Speaking Hebrew]

Peter:
 I think what he's trying to say is everything's gonna be okay.

s Friend:
 There's Craig Hoffman! He's such a rebel.

Meg:
 Oh my God, he so gorgeous! And he plays by no one's rules but his own.

s Other Friend:
 Meg, you should ask him out. I mean, you're the only one of us who's ever had a real boyfriend.

Meg:
 I'm back. (flies buzzing) I brought another picnic. You're such a good listener. You're not like the other boys. A wolf approaches and chews off the boy's arm. You're so good with animals. End Cut Scene.

Meg:
 I guess I could give it a try. All right. Here goes. She leaves the table and approaces Craig. Hi, Craig. Um, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to... I don't know, go out some time?

Craig:
 Ha. That's about as likely as me playing by someone else's rules besides my own. Which I would never do. I play by my own rules. Nobody else's. Not even my own.

Meg:
 How 'bout a movie?

Craig:
 I don't go out with dudes.

Meg:
 Mom, Dad, am I ugly?

Lois:
 Oh, of course not, sweetie.

Peter:
 Craig... Craig Hoffman said that? Well, he's a sharp kid. You might be ugly.

Stewie:
 Oh, there, there, let me dry those tears. Mmm... yes, yes. Your anguish sustains me.

Lois:
 Meg, honey, don't let those awful kids at school make you feel bad about yourself. I tell you what. Tomorrow you and I are going to go out and get you some brand new outfits. Maybe a pair of those low-rider jeans that'll show off your cute butt, huh?

Meg:
 Really? Wow, thanks, Mom.

Stewie:
 Mmm... Meg in low riders. Pictures Meg thusly. Ugh, enough of that. The image returns. Go away, damn you. The image of Meg in lowriders returns again. Oh, you're going to get it now. Stewie takes a rolling pin and assaults the thought bubble.

Peter:
 Oh, my God! Horace, what is this all about?

Horace:
 What the hell's it look like? I'm puttin' the bar up for sale.

Peter:
 Oh, please tell me this is some kind of practical joke. Like, like the kind I used to play when I was an intern at the hospital.

Peter:
 I'm afraid I have some very bad news. Your wife's gonna be a vegetable. You'll have to bathe her, feed her and care for her the rest of her life.

Man:
 Oh, my God!

Peter:
 (laughing): Nah, nah, nah, I'm just kidding. She's dead. End cut scene.

Horace:
 Ever since that Mega-Mall opened across the street, it's been taking away all my business. They got 300 stores, 200 restaurants, 53 bars and an indoor cattle ranch.

Cow:
 I go to Baskin-Robbins every night and buy myself a little treat.

Horace:
 Now, how the hell am I supposed to compete with that?

Cleveland:
 You need to fix the place up. Reinvent the Clam's image. And we'll help ya.

Horace:
 That'll take forever.

Peter:
 Not if we do a 1980s fixin'-stuff-up montage.

Quagmire:
 Wow, I think we made it worse.

Peter:
 Boy, I do not envy whoever has to clean that mess up.

Lois:
 Brian, why don't you take Stewie while Meg and I go clothes shopping?

Stewie:
 You know, it's awfully dangerous for me to be walking around the mall at my height. I say, let me get on your back.

Brian:
 Oh, for God's sake.

Stewie:
 Strong with the force, young Skywalker is.

Brian:
 God, I don't believe this.

Stewie:
 That is why you fail.

Lois:
 Oh, what about this, Meg? A pink baby-tee that says "Little Slut." That seems pretty hip.

Meg:
 I don't know if that's really me, Mom.

Lois:
 Well, they've got one that says "Porn Star" and another that says "Sperm Dumpster." And they're all written in glitter.

Meg:
 All right, all right. Give me "Sperm Dumpster."

Lois:
 That's the spirit!

Lois:
 Yes, thank you.

Sales clerk:
 Well, you just let me know if you need any...

Meg:
 How do these jeans look?

Sales clerk:
 AAAAAAAAAAAGGGH!!! The sales clerk douses herself in gasoline, ignites herself on fire and jumps out the window.

Stewie:
 Ten bucks.

Brian:
 Five bucks.

Stewie:
 Eight bucks and I'll do it.

Brian:
 Fine.

Stewie:
 Running naked through the mall. Help, I've escaped from Kevin Spacey's basement! Help me! Returning to Brian. Ha! I am so outrageous. Give me the cash.

Brian:
 Cold in here?

Stewie:
 Nope, just really small.

Meg:
 Face it, Mom. No matter what I wear I look ugly.

Lois:
 Oh, Meg, you're being... that's... eh... Let's try down here.

Tom Tucker:
 Coming up next: Joan Rivers speaks to us from beyond the grave. But first let's go to the Quahog Mega-Mall where Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa is handing out makeovovs.

Tricia Takanawa:
 That's right, Tom. Some lucky hideous woman will be transformed by our makeover magicians into someone of value to society.

Lois:
 Meg, that's it! You could get a makeover! Oh, that'd be just the thing to boost your confidence. Miss Takanawa! Miss Takanawa! Over here! Oh, my daughter needs a makeover like there's no freakin' tomorrow! The cameraman screams, douses himself in gasoline, lights himself on fire and jumps out the nearest window. Tricia holds the camera herself.

Tricia:
 It looks like we've got a winner, Tom.

Horace:
 Face it, The Clam is doomed.

Peter:
 Aw, come on, guys. We can't give up now.

Joe:
 Aw, Peter, we've tried every theme we could think of, and everything's failed. Especially that, that Coyote Ugly theme... Cut Scene. Joe, Peter, Cleveland, and Quagmire are dancing on top of the bar to an Irish jig. Joe hits himself in the face with his leg End Cut Scene.

Horace:
 Ah, it's no use. This place is finished. Quagmire, go get the "For Sale" sign.

Quagmire:
 Hey, Horace, what the hell's this?

Horace:
 Eh, it's a karaoke machine. I never got around to installing it.

Peter:
 A karaoke machine? Wait a minute, that's it. We'll turn this place into a karaoke bar! Oh, man, that's the best idea since they faked the moon landing.

Director:
 Okay, cut. Neil Armstrong exits the studio.

Passerby:
 Wow, Neil Armstrong. Hey, wait a minute, you're supposed to be on the moon. I just saw it on TV.

Neil Armstrong:
 Oh, there's, uh... uh... uh... a tape delay. And, uh... uh, solar winds... Neil smashes the passerby in the head with his helmet and shoves him in his trunk. End cut scene.

Lois:
 Peter... take a look at your daughter.

Peter:
 Oh, my God, Lois, I'm sorry. I-It was 20 years ago, I'd never even heard the word "rubber."

Lois:
 Peter, this is Meg.

Meg:
 I got a makeover, Dad! Don't I look great?!

Peter:
 Oh, Meg, honey, I always thought you were beautiful just the way you... laughing Oh, God, couldn't do that with a straight face! laughing Welcome to the family, sweetheart. Chris, go burn all Meg's old pictures.

Mort Goldman:
 ? There's got to be a morning after ? ? We're moving closer to the shore ? ? I know we'll be there by tomorrow ? ? And we'll escape the darkness ? ? We won't be searching anymore. ? ? There's got to be a morning... ? Thank you very much.

Cleveland:
 I don't understand it. This place should be jumping.

Peter:
 Well, we just need to kick it up a notch. Horace, hit it. Journey's "Don't Stop Believing" plays ? Just a small-town girl ? ? Living in a lonely world ? ? She took the midnight train going anywhere ? Grabs Cleveland by the arm.

Cleveland:
 Oh, Peter, don't make me do th... ? Just a city boy ? ? Born and raised in South Detroit ? ? He took the midnight train going anywhere ?

Mayor West:
 Oh, God. I love this song. And I love it when amateurs sing the lyrics. But I hate baseball cards.

Joe:
 ? Some will win ? ? Some will lose ? ? Some were born to sing the blues ?

Quagmire:
 ? Oh, the movie never ends ? ? It goes on and on and on and on and on... ? ? Giggety-giggety-giggety-goo!

Joe:
 Guys, we were freakin' electric!

Quagmire:
 Yeah, they loved us!

Peter:
 Gentlemen, this is a sign! We are gonna start our own rock band! Huh? Who's with me?!

Cleveland:
 I'm in!

Joe:
 I'm in!

Quagmire:
 I'm in!

Bill Cosby:
 Looks like the guys are gonna form a rock band. Maybe they'll learn a little something. Stick around, you just might learn something, too. Hey, hey, hey!

Brian:
 You know, Peter, just because you guys entertained a bunch of drunken idiots at a karaoke bar doesn't mean you have what it takes to form a band.

Peter:
 Oh, Brian, you're just ants at a picnic. We're gonna be awesome.

Brian:
 Wait, wait, what, what am I? I'm ants at a picnic? Is that what you just said? I just, I, I'm ants at a picnic? All right. Just making sure.

Quagmire:
 Yeah, hey, sorry I'm late, fellas.

Cleveland:
 Aw, cool, Glenn. You look just like Tommy Lee.

Quagmire:
 Well, I figure it would be appropriate since I just found out I got hepatitis.

Joe:
 You know, maybe we should have decided on outfits that matched. Now we all look like a bunch of queers.

Peter:
 Fellas, it doesn't matter what you wear, as long as you play kick-ass rock 'n' roll and do this with your tongue. Am I right, Gene?

Gene Simmons:
 You got that right, Pete.

Lois:
 laughing Oh, my. Hi, Gene, I didn't know you were here. All right, all right. Keep it in your mouth, rock star.

Student:
 whistles Wow! Great job getting hot, Meg!

Meg:
 Gee, thanks!

Craig Hoffman:
 Hey, Meg.

Meg:
 Oh, hi, Craig.

Craig:
 Now that you're attractive, how about we go out some time?

Meg:
 Gosh, I'd love to.

Craig:
 Great. I'll pick you up whenever I feel like it.

Connie DiMico:
 Hey, Meg. We noticed Craig Hoffman just asked you out. That makes you cool. Wanna hang out with us?

Meg:
 Wow. Sure.

Craig:
 Hey. I'm here to pick you up.

Peter:
 Here we are, fellas, our first major gig.

Cleveland:
 Peter, this is a house of corrections. Yeah, you gotta start somewhere, fellas.

Peter:
 That's how you evolve, like when the Tin Man found out he was gay.

Tin Man:
 Oh. Oh. Look what happened by accident. End Cut Scene.

Lois:
 All right, kids, now, everyone stay together.

Warden:
 The people who beat you are proud to present, all the way from Quahog... Fat, Horny, Black and Joe!

Peter:
 Hello, Cleveland!

Cleveland:
 Hello, Peter.

Quagmire:
 One, two, three, four!

Peter:
 Oh, my God, we don't know any songs.

Inmates:
 You suck! Get off the stage!

Peter:
 What do we do?

Quagmire:
 I know what I'm doing-- I'm getting outta here! Giggidy, giggidy, giggidy, gone!

Peter:
 Uh... hey, uh, how about a funny story about Lake Wobegon? It was the day of the tuna hot-dish jamboree... Peter is struck by a chair.

Lois:
 Oh, no, kids, your father's in trouble. I'm going up there.

Chris:
 I'm coming, too, Mom. Oh, my God. The guy behind me braided my hair.

Lois:
 Chris, grab a guitar, Brian, take the drums. Here, Stewie, play with this. Hands Stewie a tambourine.

Meg:
 Mom, can we please just get out of here?

Inmate:
 Oh, my God!

Other Inmate:
 Who is she? God, I could strangle her all night long. Boy, that's not healthy, is it, that that's the first place I go to?

Lois:
 Hit it!

Meg:
 with soft accompaniment ? Cloudy skies and rain clouds ? ? Have come to stay ? ? Windy nights and sad sights won't go away ?

Family:
 ? Sha-la-la-la-la ?

Meg:
 ? But I want to be without a care ? ? Unicorns and butterflies everywhere ?

Family:
 driving rhythm kicks in ? Gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna ? ? Buy me a rainbow ? ? Gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna ? ? Wrap it up in a great big bow ?

Meg:
 ? The time is right, it's day not night ? ? Just open up your heart ? ? It'll be all right ?

Family:
 ? Gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna ? ? Buy me a rainbow! ?

Meg:
 ? Buy me a rainbow! ?

Family:
 ? Rainbow! ? The inmates cheer.

Jimmy Iovine:
 You guys were great! My name's Jimmy Iovine, and I'd like to make you filthy rich rock stars.

Brian:
 Wow, you're the chairman of Interscope Records. What are you doing in prison?

Jimmy:
 Eh, I stomped a cat to death. Listen, you guys got talent.

Peter:
 Well, where do we sign?

Jimmy:
 Right here on Tony's butt cheek. Tony screams. And initial here. Tony screams again. And here. Tony screams again. And date. Tony screams again.

Peter:
 Oh, crap. Today's the 17th. Tony screams and collapses.

Peter:
 How was that, Dr. Diddy?

Puff Daddy:
 Yo, that sounded smooth, y'all. I just have a couple...

Brian:
 (barking) Oh, oh, oh, God. Oh, God. I am so sorry. I keep doing that. Oh, God, please, please forgive me. I get that from my father. He's from a different generation. It's, uh...

Puff Daddy:
 Whatever, man.

Brian:
 We, we cool? We good?

Puff Daddy:
 Yeah, we're cool. Fine.

Brian:
 (growling)

Chris:
 Um, Mr. Doctor, if you get shot in a rap feud, can you perform surgery on yourself?

Puff Daddy:
 Well, no, Chris, my degree is in optometry.

Peter:
 All right, Dr. Diddy, I got three choices for you for the name of the band. Peter Griffin Starship, Peter Griffin and the Sunday Steppers, or Testicular Sound Express.

Puff Daddy:
 I think the name is "Meg."

Meg:
 Me? Why?

Peter:
 Yeah, why?

Puff Daddy:
 Let me explain something to you, a'ight? We gotta get her half-naked and put her out front, center stage, and that's gonna make y'all billionaires, because America loves hot, white jailbait ass.

Peter:
 Wait a minute. That's the smartest thing I've ever heard anyone say about anything.

Lois:
 I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Meg being exploited that way.

Meg:
 Shut up, Mom, it's not your decision! I want to be exploited.

Lois:
 Meg, don't you talk to me like that.

Peter:
 Look, Lois, I love Mealticket just as much as I love Chris and Stevie, but business is business. So let's get this show on the road, eh?

Puff Daddy:
 Good. Now, I just need you to sign these...

Brian:
 (barking) Oh, God. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Oh, my God. That-that is not me. That's not who I am. I vote Democrat. Uh, it will not happen again. W-We cool? We good?

Brian:
 You, uh, y-you guys know I have no problem with black people, right?

 Stewie:
 Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah, sure.

Stewie:
 Well, you did say you hated Crooklyn.

Brian:
 Hey, Doc. You, uh, got a minute?

Puff Daddy:
 What you want, dawg?

Brian:
 Uh, yeah, so, uh, hey, check it out. Uh, Stewie and I have, been, uh, working on some, uh, stuff of our own, and, uh, we thought there might be a place for us...

Brian:
 ...to sing on the next album. Hey, uh, cool. You're busy. No sweat. Boy, Benson was a funny show. I'll talk to you later.

Stewie:
 Well, what did he say?

Brian:
 He said he'd think about it. Okay, so, uh, where were we?

Stewie:
 Oh, okay.

Stewie:
 ? I want to have intercourse with you, uh ooo yeah ? ? Intercourse with you ?

Brian:
 ? Relations ?

Stewie:
 ? Intercourse with you-oo-oo. ?

Stewie:
 Right?

Brian:
 Yeah, no, great. That sounds good.

Stewie:
 All right, all right. Yeah, groovy, groovy. Now, uh, is there a shorter word for intercourse?

Meg:
 Lois, go grab me another bag of Skittles.

Lois:
 Excuse me, young lady?

Meg:
 Did I freakin' stutter? I said-- more Skittles!

Lois:
 All right, that is it, Meg. You know, ever since you got that makeover, you've developed a terrible attitude, and all this success with the family band is only making it worse.

Meg:
 The "family band"? You know, maybe you haven't noticed, Lois, but I am the band. Right, Miss Swan?

Miss Swan:
 Oh, yeah, she band. Old lady jealous.

Lois:
 (sighs) Peter, we have to do something. We're losing our daughter. I'm worried about what's happening to her.

Peter:
 Lois, Lois, this is the kind of thing that always resolves itself if you just ignore it. All right? W-what's more important is, we're living the sweet life, huh? This is even more fun than when I performed at the White House.

Man:
 Mr. President, I present to you, Peter Griffin.

Peter:
 A-booga-booga-booga! booga-begga-begga...! Blah-blah-blah-blah.

President:
 (laughing)

Peter:
 (raspberries)

President:
 (sobbing)

Puff Daddy:
 Okay, listen up, everybody, I got great news. Meg, you and your family are gonna perform on Saturday Night Live.

Peter:
 You mean I'm going to get to meet John Belushi and Gilda Radner and Phil Hartman and Chris Farley and Horatio Sanz? Sweet!

Chris:
 Wow, Saturday Night Live. I can't think of anything more exciting!

Chris:
 Ooh. Oh, my God! A water fountain!

Jimmy Fallon:
 Hey, Meg... (snickers) I'm Jimmy Fallon. It's, uh, it's great to finally meet you. I'm hosting. Hey, uh... why don't you come hang out in my dressing room?

Meg:
 What are you looking at?

Jimmy Fallon:
 Oh, uh, nothing. Uh, come on, let's go.

Lois:
 Peter, I'm worried about Meg. She's spiraling out of control. I mean, what if she develops a coke problem?

Peter:
 No Coke. Pepsi. (laughing)

Lois:
 (groans)

Peter:
 Oh, come on. You set me up for that one.

Meg:
 Wow, Jimmy, that was everything Ladies Home Journal said it would be.

Jimmy Fallon:
 Awesome. Great. Thanks. Um, you know, there's there's something I... (laughs) There's something I've gotta tell you. Being with you just made me feel so a... live from New York, it's Saturday Night!

Meg:
 (gasps)

Announcer:
 It's Saturday Night Live.

Peter:
 Yeah, that wasn't a very good opening sketch, was it? A rare miss.

Lois:
 I don't think that was a sketch, Peter.

Meg:
 (sobbing) Mom! Dad! He used me for comedy!

Peter:
 Wait a minute. Are you telling me that my daughter was deflowered in front of one-and-a-half times the Mad TV audience?

Lois:
 Oh, my poor baby.

Peter:
 My God, Lois, you were right. Why the hell didn't I see it coming? All right, stand aside. It's about time I did my fatherly duty. Ha-ha! I said "doodie." But no time to laugh about it now.

Jimmy Fallon:
 Hey, everybody. It's, uh, great to be back. So, we got a great show tonight and, uh...

Peter:
 Hey, Fallon. Say good night, ya bum!

Peter:
 And this is for laughing and looking at the camera during every sketch you've ever been in! Who do you think you are? Carol Burnett? You think because she did it, it's okay for you?! You haven't earned what she's earned, buddy!

Peter:
 All right, now where's the guy who slept with my daughter?

Meg:
 I'm so glad to be the real me again. It's too much work being beautiful.

Lois:
 (chuckles) Not for me, but it's good to have you back, Pumpkin.

Peter:
 Well, I guess there's only one thing left to do.

Peter:
 Uh, listen, thanks, everybody. I had a great time tonight. Uh, I wanna thank Jimmy Fallon for being such a good sport. Uh, Lois, Meg, Stewie, Brian, Chris. Uh, the guys from the prison, uh, Counting Crows... Uh, uh, if I'm forgetting anybody, I'm sorry. Good night, everybody! Our thoughts are with you, Chevy!

Announcer:
 From the world-famous Apollo Theatre in Harlem. It's Showtime at the Apol...

Brian:
 What? I'm tired. It has nothing to do with the fact that it's a black show. What, I can't be tired at 1:00 in the morning?

Cleveland:
 This is ridiculous. Why did y'all drag me here?

Cleveland:
 Well, I suppose I could give it a try. (Walks over to a woman standing by the bar.) Hey, baby. How'd you like to go black and then have to make a difficult decision regarding whether or not to go back?

Woman:
 Sorry, I went burnt sienna and never went back. (A burnt sierra crayon comes up.)

Crayon:
 Ready, baby? Who's this clown?

Lois:
 Good morning, Chris. Oh, my God. Look at the size of that pimple! You're like a circus freak! ( laughs ) I'm kidding. You're just becoming a man, sweetie.

Peter:
 Yeah, I remember when I became a man.

Peter:
 Peter.

Chris:
 But I don't want to get rid of my zit. I like him. He's my friend. His name is Doug.

Brian:
 I just wish I didn't have to look at it.

Chris:
 Well, we have to look at your anus all day.

Stewie:
 Thank you!

Meg:
 Oh, my God! The Bachelorette is coming to Quahog! That's, like, my favorite show ever!

Brian:
 Meg, how can you watch that crap? That show's not reality. It's all staged. It's a complete mockery of human relationships.

Chris:
 You're a good pimple, Doug.

Doug:
 Feed me!

Chris:
 ( gasps ) You... talk!

Doug:
 That's right. And we're gonna raise some hell. All right! Raise some hell!

Cleveland:
 Peter, I can't do this. I'm too nervous. I gotta go.

Peter:
 No, no, Cleveland, I'm not going to let you do this. I'll tie you down if I have to.

Cleveland:
 Peter, this is only making it worse. Oh, God, my claustrophobia is setting in!

Peter:
 It's all right, it's all right, it's okay. It's all right. It's the fabric. It's the fabric. It's your clothes. All right, let's get your clothes off.

Cleveland:
 Peter! Peter, what's wrong with you? I'm naked.

Peter:
 Oh, God, you're self-conscious. I'm sorry. Here, you know what? Look, look. Cleveland. Look. See? See? Now you're not alone. You're not alone, Cleveland.

Cleveland:
 Let me out of here! I need to get out of here!

Peter:
 Cleveland, no. No, you're staying. This, this for your own good. This is for your own good.

Brian:
 Hi. Yeah, listen, I just wanted to apologize for Peter. He was just trying to help out his friend. You see, his wife left him and he's been kind of lonely, confused about what he really wants.

Brian:
 They are stupid, but I figure I got a few days of free booze and free food before they kick me off. I could use a vacation.

Stewie:
 Oh, yes, 'cause you've got such a heavy workload around here. Hmm, how you, uh... how you coming on that novel you working on? Hmm? Got a big, uh, big stack of papers there? Got a, got a, got a nice little story you working on there? Your big -big novel you've been working on for three years? ( voice rising in pitch ) Hmm? Got a, got a compelling protagonist, eh? Got a, got an obstacle for him to overcome? Huh? Got a story brewing there? Working on... Working on that for quite some time, huh? Yeah, talking about that three years ago. You've been working on that the whole time? Nice little, uh, narrative-- beginning, middle and end? Some friends become enemies, some enemies become friends? Eh? At the end your main character is richer ( voice still higher in pitch ) for the experience, yeah? Yeah? Yeah, you've got, uh-- no, no. You deserve some time off. I'm super-excited. You think she'll be hot? I bet she'll be hot. I think she'll be hot, too!

Lois:
 Peter, I 'm getting a little worried about Chris. All he does lately is sit alone in his room talking to that zit.

Peter:
 Oh, relax, Lois. What's a zit going to do? Talk to him and tell him to sneak out of the house and cause trouble?

Doug:
 Now light it, ring the doorbell, and run like hell!

Chris:
 I don't know about this, Doug.

Doug:
 Just do it! ( doorbell rings )

Joe:
 Oh, good Lord! Is that. .. Doody!

Bonnie:
 I'm doing the dishes, Joe. I'll change you in a minute.

Trevor:
 I wasn't too nervous. I mean, when I'm nervous I work out and I wasn't working out, so I must not have been nervous. I was... I was very pleased and surprised.

Brian:
 I really was not expecting an open bar. Top shelf booze, I tell you. And this guy knew his stuff. Made me a mojito. I don't think it's a gay drink. Mo-ji-to.

Quagmire:
 ( breathlessly ) Giggity... giggity... giggity. ..

Quagmire:
 Giggity... giggity... giggity. .. (sighing)

Trevor:
 Dude, put your pants on.

Quagmire :
 shut up! Well, I really like all the guys, but some of them seem Sa little too competitive. I uh, I gotta tell ya, I don't know what she would possibly see in Count Chocula. I-I thin k he's just here because he's a minority.

Chris:
 You were right, Doug! Mischief is fun! We're the best pals since the Snorks.

Brooke:
 Brian.

Brian:
 What? Are you serious?

Brooke:
 I feel like I didn't get to know you at all. Would you accept this rose?

Brian:
 ( sighing) All right, but I think this whole thing is about as pointless as Peter's cow kite.

Stewie:
 Ooh, that means this room is mine now. Man, I'm going to party my ass off in here.

Stewie:
 Yeah, I got it from our cleaning lady's boyfriend. It's okay, though, 'cause she's gonna use the money to get a mammogram.

Lois:
 Chris! Where have you been?

Chris:
 Doug told me I don't need to listen to you.

Lois:
 Doug? Your pimple? Oh, that is it! First thing tomorrow we're going down to Goldman's pharmacy and get some astringent to get rid of that thing.

Doug:
 What did I tell you? She's trying to drive us apart. We can't let that happen. I am in no mood!

Brian:
 Oh, come on. You can' t expect me to ride that thing.

Brian:
 Brooke? What are you doing here?

Brooke:
 Ooh, I just can't take it anymore. All these guys just coming on to me. I had to sneak off. Oh, could I bum one of those?

Brian:
 You know , I don't even know why I agreed to do this show. This is just so not me. I would much rather just be home, listening to my old jazz records.

Brooke:
 Really? You know , I actually have quite a jazz collection myself.

Brian:
 Who do you like?

Brooke:
 DJ Jazzy Jeff.

Brooke:
 I'm kidding. ( laughing )

Brian:
 Oh! You got me. You got me, yeah.

Brooke:
 No, I really like Coleman Hawkins, Ben Webster... ooh, and early Coltrane, before he got clean.

Brian:
Yeah, yeah, no junk, no soul.

Brooke:
 No kidding. I mean, look at Chevy Chase.

Brian:
 Right, right. You know , I gotta say, I thought she was just some actress looking for her 15 minutes of fame, but she's, uh... she's pretty sharp, you know? I guess you can't judge a Brooke by her cover. ( chuckling ) You can... you can cut that out, right? Oh, and maybe you can cut when I said "junk" earlier, the whole Chevy Chase thing. Seems like he's probably the kind of guy who might sue. I mean, the guy's gotta have no money left.

Lois:
 Oh, my God. Peter, d o you think Chris might have done this?

Peter:
 Come on, Lois, he doesn't have the wild streak you had when you were younger. For God' s sake, you used to make plaster molds of celebrity body parts.

Lois:
 Okay, Daryl, it's almost dry. Very nice, by the way. This one 's going on the shelf right next to Dan Fogelberg.

 :
Hey, Lois. Am I up next?

Lois:
 Just wait in your dressing room. I'll come back for you, Oates. ( door closes ) I'm not coming back for Oates.

Brooke:
 Glenn, will you accept this rose?

Quagmire:
 Really? After I drugged you and tried to have sex with your unconscious body?

Brooke:
 What?

Quagmire:
 Yes.

 Peter:
 Brian! Welcome home, you son of a bitch! So, did you lose? ! You got to tell me all about it. Hey, how was the bachelorette? Was she a dumb bimbo, like you said, but with a big rack? ( laughs ) Come on in and tell me everything. I bet your stories will make me laugh so hard I shoot milk out of my nose.

Brian:
 Um, Peter, this is Brooke, the bachelorette. She's, uh, having dinner with us tonight. I went over this with you a few minutes ago.

Peter:
(laughing and then shooting milk out of his nose)

Joe:
Peter, Lois, we h ave proof that it was Chris who vandalized Goldman's Pharmacy. I knew it. I knew it! I didn't want to believe it, but it's true.

JOE:
 Do you know what a cavity search is? You made my mom c

 Quagmire:
 Glenn, would you feed Mittens?

Quagmire:
 Mittens has food in his bowl.

 Quagmire:
 That's old food. (Mittens meowing )

Quagmire:
 Mittens, shut up. Mittens, shut up!

 Quagmire:
 Don't you talk to Mittens that way! Mittens is a member of this family!

Quagmire:
 Mom, you want this three-way to happen, you're going to have to change your tone.

Brian:
 My God, you've just made me the happiest dog in the world. I love you, Brooke.

Brooke:
 I love you too, Brian. All right, that's a wrap. Well, it was great working with you, Brian. Good luck.

Brian:
 What? What are you talking about? Wh-What about us?

Michael Eisner:
 Hi , Brian.

Brian:
 Michael Eisner?

Michael:
 On behalf of ABC, I'd like to give you this parting gift.

Brian:
 The bill for the mansion?

Michael:
 No givesies backsies! ( phone line rings ) Uh, hey, Brooke. It's, uh, it's me again-- Brian. Hi. Wasn't sure if you got my last message. Or, uh, any of the other ones. Um, anyway, I'll just leave a quick message, 'cause you might be trying to call me right now and I don't want to tie up the line, so, I guess, um... Uh, I guess, yeah, give me a call. Okay, I'm hanging up. In three, two, one. Okay, call me back. I'll be here. All day. And tonight. Okay, bye. (phone rings) Uh, hey, me again. Thought I might have heard a voice when I was hanging up. Nope? Guess not. Okay, I will talk to you soon. Hello? No, sorry. Hey, babe, just trying you again, listening to our guy Coltrane... you know, okay... Anyway, I got a fax earlier about cheap airfare to Cancun. Didn't know if that was you trying to reach me. Uh, you know, let me give you my home number again, just in case you lost it... Electronic voice: voice mail is full. Damn.

Delivery Man:
 (doorbell ringing) Package for Brooke Roberts.

Brooke:
 Oh, that's me, thanks.

Brian:
 (on new machine) Uh, hey, there. Me again. Your voice mail was full, so I got you this answering machine. So, uh, what's go ing on?! I'm thinking about doing something tonight...

Brian:
 Hey, you're home.

Brooke:
 Listen, Brian, I want you to leave me alone or I am calling the cops.

Brian:
 ? Brooke, I'm so in love with you... ?

Doug:
 Aw! Oh! Aw! Aw! Chris, where the hell are we?

Chris:
 I told you, Doug, thi s is the bacon factory. Doctor, I need you to get rid of this zit!

Doug:
 You traitor!

Doctor:
 Whoa, that's a doozy. I bet some of those awful kids at school call you zit face. "No." Papa Zit? "No." Puss Peak? "No." Fat ass? Well, yeah. Tsk, tsk. Oh, that's terrible. Well, we're going to have to use some cortisone on that.

Doug:
 Oh, yeah? Two can play at that game. (gunshot) Don't think I won't do it, man!

Chris:
 All right, all right, let's all be cool here... (grunting)

Doctor:
 No! Whew! You okay, fat ass?

Brian:
 She told me she loved me, on what used to be a hit TV show. God, I can't believe I got sucked in to that phony reality world just like everyone else. I became the very thing I was mocking.

Stewie:
 Oh, I know it hurts now, Brian, but look at the bright side. You have some new material for that novel you've been writing. You know, the novel you've been working on. You know, the one you've been working on for three years? (voice rising in pitch): You know, the novel? Got something new to write about now, you know? Maybe your... maybe your main character gets into a relationship? (voices rises in pitch again) Suffers a little heartbreak? Something like what-what you've been... you've just been through? Draw from real-life experiences? A little heartbreak, you know, work it into the story? Make those characters a little more three dimensional? (very high pitch) A little richer experience for the reader? Make those second hundred pages really keep the reader guessing what's going to happen? Some twists and turns? (squeaking in high falsetto) A little epilogue? Everybody learns the hero's journey isn't always a happy one? (normal voice) Oh, I look forward to reading it.

Lois:
 Thanks for babysitting, Meg. We'll be back in a couple of hours.

Meg:
 I don't understand why I have to babysit Stewie. I mean, what's he really gonna do if we leave him by himself?

Stewie:
 And now to test my teleportation pods!

Stewie:
 Oh damn!

Stewie:
 I'M A MONSTER!

Stewie:
 So, um...t-this is, uh, awkward, but, uh, h-have we ever actually, you know, met? I mean y-you know I-I don't even know, say, for example, if you have a room up there. You know, a room? I have a room. You know, Meg, if you kill yourself now, you'll probably get a full page in the yearbook. So, um...you know, that's something to think about- (Stewie burps) Oh, I just burped.

Neil:
 Hi Meg, you busy Saturday night?

Meg:
 Neil, you ask me out, like, once a day, and I always give you the same answer: No!

Meg:
 God, I don't think I could have been any clearer the last time I turned him down.

Debra:
 Ray, your mother insulted my steak pizzola again.

Meg:
 Neil Goldman of Quahog, Rhode Island -- (Shouting) Leave me alone! I hate you! I hate you!

Debra:
 Anyway, your mother insulted--

Ray:
 (Cutting her off) I don't care anymore, Patty. After nine seasons, I just don't care. Maybe you could try not being a bitch.

Peter:
 Hey Mort, Lois and I are out on a date night, uh, why don't you give me some condoms? And some Excedrin. My wife's got a headache (moves his hands toward his crotch) THIS big. (laughing) You know? It's like from the commercial. (moves his hands toward his head) This big? Only it's my junk.

Mort:
 Alright, then. Twelve dollars and forty-three cents.

Peter:
 Aw, jeez, that's more of a ripoff than that breakfast machine I bought.

Peter:
 Gah! Ow! Ow, What was the point of all that? Ow, all it does is shoot ya! It doesn't make breakfast at all! Oww!

Peter:
 Besides, I forgot my wallet.

Mort:
 Well, that's ok, I'll just open up a tab.

Peter:
 Wait a minute, what the hell is a tab? Does that mean I don't gotta pay?

Mort:
 Well, not right now but--

Peter:
 (cutting Mort off) Aww sweet! Hey, while I'm at it, gimmie all these copies of Marie Claire. Y'know in case I wanna rub out that easy one before I get Lois into bed tonight.

Peter:
 (excited) Kathleen Turner, eh, let's see how she looks and- (turns to the right page, not excited anymore) Aww, that's a shame.

TV Announcer:
 And now back to the Kids' Choice Awards, with host, Paula Poundstone!

Paula:
 (pointing into the audience) I choose you, and you, and you. So, come up!

Paula:
 (Shouting) I said let's go!

Stewie:
 (shouting from upstairs) Meg! Meg, I'm hungry! There's a granola bar in the cupboard, I want it!

Stewie:
 Hey. Hey! What's this? What's goin' on? Am I talking to myself up there?

Meg:
 Oh my God, Stewie! (Shouting) Just shut up and go to bed!

Stewie:
 Do you know what I do, Meg? I spit in your mouth while you sleep.

Meg:
 Finally! Look, mom, I've had it! I'm not babysitting anymore! It's Saturday night, I could be out having a life!

Lois:
 Meg, if you don't want to babysit anymore, that's fine, but don't you stand there and lie to me.

Peter:
 Oh Meg, she torched your ass, man! She torched your ass!

Meg:
 Why can't you just hire a real babysitter?

Lois:
 Well, I guess we could do that.

Stewie:
 Damn! I'm terrible at meeting new people...like the time I was on Blind Date!

Woman:
 I'm having a great time, Stewie.

Stewie:
 Me too. So, uh, you ready to go grab some 'za?

Woman:
 Uh...yea

Stewie drops the ball in:
 3...2...1"

Stewie:
 So, uh, wild guess here, but from the looks of your arm hair, I'm guessing you're Italian?

Peter:
 Alright, you guys, I got eight crates of Ipecac all on my tab. Now, whoever goes the longest without puking gets the last piece of pie in the fridge.

Peter:
 Ok, here we go...how's everybody doin?

Brian:
 Good, good so far.

Peter:
 Alright, alright.

Stewie:
 Nothing yet.

Peter:
 Cool, cool...You know, I dunno if you guys have had any of that pie already, but that is, uh, that is some tasty stuff. That's from the uh, bake sale that Lois was {suddenly throws up}

Stewie:
 OOh, one down. I know somebody who won't be having any {throws up}

Chris:
 I'm starting to feel funny.

Brian:
 Well, I feel fine. I guess I'm {throws up}

Chris:
 Oh boy! That means I win! I get to eat {throws up}

Stewie:
 Oh God, why didn't anybody tell me {throws up}

Peter:
 Oh my God, my insides are on {throws up}

Stewie:
 No, no please, no more, no more {throws up}

Chris:
 Dad, I'm scared. {throws up}

Brian:
 Get the phone, call 91-{throws up}

Peter:
 Lois! Lois get in here {walks backwards, throws up and hits the wall}

Brian:
 OK, ok. I think it's all gone. I think [throws up}

Stewie:
 I don't wanna, I don't wanna {throws up}

Brian:
 Peter, Peter, I need you to hold my ears {throws up}

Lois:
 Who wants chowder?

Peter:
 What the hell? Hey Meg, you better check this out.

Meg:
 Oh, God. This is so embarrassing. I can't believe this is happening to me.

Peter:
 Awww, looks like someone could use a greeting card to cheer 'em up. I put these on my tab. Here, take a "Far Side" one. The vulture thinks he's a cowboy! {laughs}

Meg:
 {Chuckles} It is kinda funny.

Quagmire:
 Hey, Peter, you got a card for if you transferred VD to somebody?

Peter:
 Uhh, let's see here...uhh...yep. "Sorry I accidentally gave you VD"

Quagmire:
 Aw, all you got is accidental, huh? All right, I'll take it.

Lois:
 Well, first let me thank you for answering the ad. Now, what do you feel qualifies you to be an effective babysitter for Stewie?

Stewie:
 Uh, yea, uh, we couldn't run an ad that said 'No Portuguese', but, um...no Portuguese.

Lois:
 So, I see here that you've worked for a family for a number of years. Can I call the uh..{squints at the clipboard} Herculoids for a reference?

Lois:
 I-I'm sorry, I don't understand.

Lois:
 The position has been filled.

Lois:
 The position has been filled, thank you very much, you can go now.

Lois:
 {Pissed off} LEAVE! NOW!

Lois:
 I didn't think it was going to be this hard to choose a babysitter.

Stewie:
 Yes, if only you were this discerning when you picked that happening hairdo.

Girl:
 Sorry I'm late. Can I still apply for the job?

Stewie:
 My God, I haven't been this exhilarated since Brian took me to see Les Miserables.

Announcer:
 Attention, ladies and gentlemen, there will be a slight change in the cast tonight.

Brian:
 Oh, no.

Announcer:
 For this evening's performance, the role of Jean Valjean will be played by Kirk Cameron.

Stewie:
 OH! Oh, unbelieveable! Oh my God! How lucky are we, huh? 'Hey Stewie, what are you doing tonight?' 'Oh, nothing, just watching KIRK CAMERON play Jean Valjean!' Oh my God! Curtain up!

Mort:
 Peter, are you EATING those?

Peter:
 {sarcastic} No, I'm shoving them up my butt! Of course I'm eating them! Gimme a carton!

Mort:
 Peter, it's the end of the month, and I'm calling your tab! You owe me $34,000!

Peter:
 WHAT?! Aww, man, how am I gonna come up with that kinda money?

Mort:
 Peter, I'm waiting.

Peter:
 All right, all right, I got another idea. What if I sold you my daughter?

Mort:
 Huh?

Peter:
 You drop the tab, and your son can have Meg.

Meg:
 WHAT?!

Peter:
 Yup, all you gotta do is sign this contract.

Meg:
 ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND!? YOU CAN'T SELL ME, YOU FAT SON OF A BITCH!

Peter:
 Woaa! Careful getting this fish off the hook, Mort, she's got some fangs. {laughs}

Mort:
 What do you think of that, Neil? Daddy bought you a girlfriend!

Neil:
 Excuse me, if anybody's interested, I already have a girlfriend.

Meg:
 There's no way--wait what?

Girl:
 You ready to go, honey?

Neil:
 You rejected me too many times, Meg. I couldn't wait for you forever. Besides, Cecilia thinks my psoriasis is sexy.

Meg:
 I can't believe he's over me.

Mort:
 I can't believe I'm out 34 grand!

Peter:
 I can't believe it's not butter! {laughing} Stick around, more Family Guy comin' up!

Lois:
 Peter, how could you have tried to sell our daughter?

Peter:
 Alright, Lois. I don't want this to ruin our date night, so I'll make it up to ya.

Lois:
 Oh, Peter. {reading the card} "I'm sorry I tried to sell our daughter".

Peter:
 Yeah, you dunno how hard it was to find one of those in English.

Stewie:
 Ahh, tonight the babysitter comes, Rupert. Lovely LaDonne. Mmm...

Stewie:
 {imitating conversation} Oh, hey LaDonne. Hey, what's goin' on? How are you? Yea. Oh, just me, Stewie. Just, uh, bein' myself. Uh...yea..Oh, uh, wha, this here? Just my package. Yea, just, just uh, just uh, my package. God delivered it, I signed for it, the world keeps on spinning. Yea.

LaDonne:
 Oh no! {laughs}

Stewie:
 Oh, Jenga, there it is! {laughs} Oh well, I guess that's why they call it Jenga, Mm? {laughs again}

LaDonne:
 Stewie! You are so cute I can't even stand it!

Stewie:
 Oh, thank you. I'm having a good time too. I hope I don't make any social faux pas, like I did at Pamela and Tommy Lee's dinner party.

Stewie:
 Hi, Sorry I'm late. I was visiting my aunt in the hospital, she has hep...atitis...Oooo, sorry.

Cecilia:
 Neil is such an amazing guy. We just make an absolutely perfect couple.

Meg:
 Y'know, Neil liked me first. And I WAS gonna go out with him when I was ready to settle for him. Get your own spaz!

Gym teacher:
 All right, ladies, enough chit-chat. Take it off, get in the shower, and bounce around for me.

Lois:
 Sweetie, your daddy and I are going to the movies tonight. How would you like LaDonne to babysit?

Stewie:
 YES! Oh, I'm going to wow her tonight, Rupert. I'm gonna be cooler than Brian when he hangs out at the bowling alley.

Brian:
 That's what I love about high school girls, I keep gettin' older, they stay the same age {chuckles}, yes they do, yes they do.

Meg:
 Please go out with me. I'm just trying to make Neil jealous. I promise I'll pay and everything.

GUY:
 Yeah, uh, that sounds cool, but I'm gonna be in the hospital that night.

LaDonne:
 Hi, gorgeous man.

Stewie:
 Oh, you. Must I lock up your tongue with the rest of the silver? {laughs}

LaDonne:
 Stewie, this is Jeremy.

Jeremy:
 Hey, little man. So you're the guy who's been trying to steal my girlfriend.

Stewie:
 Wha-you...GIRLFRIEND?! Oh, what kind of sick, twisted game are you playing at?

LaDonne:
 Stewie sounds a little cranky. I'll put him to bed.

Stewie:
 HA! I got your hat! Take that, hatless! Now go back to the quad and resume your hackey-sack tourney! I'm not going to lie down for some frat boy bastard with his damn Teva sandals and his Skoal Bandits and his Abercrombie and Fitch long-sleeve, open stitched, crew-neck henley smoking his sticky buds out of a soda can while watching his favorite downloaded Simpson episodes every night! Yes, we all love Mr. Plow - oh, you've got the song memorized, do you? SO DOES EVERYONE ELSE! That is exactly the kind of idiot you see at Taco Bell at one in the morning - the guy who just whiffed his way down the bar-skank ladder.

LaDonne:
 Goodnight, Stewie.

Stewie:
 If he wants to throw hands, I'll throw hands! I tell you...{LaDonne puts a pacifier in Stewie's mouth}

Meg:
 Oh, hey. Neil and Cecilia. I didn't expect to see you here! Meet Jake, my boyfriend!

Jake:
 I want some BB's! My dad lets me shoot at cats!

Cecilia:
 Oh! Hi Meg! Neil and I are celebrating our two-week anniversary! Oh, it seems like only yesterday he was only a stranger videotaping me through the window.

Meg:
 Big deal. He did that to me 3 years ago. AND he gave me the tapes for Christmas.

Cecilia:
 He gave me DVDs. The production values were amazing, much better than Kramer vs. Predator.

Kramer:
 You want him back? You can't just dissapear for three months and suddenly decide you want him back! You can't have him! {swipes a glass of wine into the wall}

Meg:
 Well, I'm glad Neil's over me anyway. I'm with Jake now. Right, Jake?

Jake:
 Maybe someday we'll get married and you can go up on me.

Meg:
 Neil! I want to be your girlfriend!

Neil:
 What?

Meg:
 I was wrong to drive you away. We belong together.

Neil:
 Of course I'm understandibly skeptical of your newfound affection for me.

Meg:
 You still got that contract our dads drew up?

Meg:
 Gimme that!

Cecilia:
 {talking to Jake} You wanna hook up?

Jake:
 BUY ME SOMETHING!

Meg:
 I can't believe we're going out. This is so cool!

Meg:
 Neil, Neil, n-not so fast.

Neil:
 {laughs} Uh, Meg, you need to fufill your contractual obligations.

Meg:
 What are you talking about?

Neil:
 All right, Meg, according to the contract, every night, you have to put on my pajamas. My mom's record is 12 seconds.

Meg:
 Neil, I think you're old enough to-

Neil:
 {cutting Meg off} GO!

Stewie:
 Oh, LaDonne, I thought we could watch a DVD together. I picked up the first season of Jiminy Glick, oh, imagine being that guy for a day.

Stewie:
 {Stewie keeps changing positions on the chair} Colin Farrell! So, I was talking to my wife, Dixie, the other day, and she was saying that you weren't a very good actor. And I agreed with her. Now, now why, now why Colin? Why would we both say that?

Stewie:
 All right, that's it! Jeremy must be destroyed!

Jeremy:
 Mom?

Jeremy:
 Dad? Mom? Is anyone there.

Jeremy:
 Uh...little man? Y-you in here?

Stewie:
 I say, I think this is how you change a tire, but what would I know? I'm just a baby!

Stewie:
 Here's your iPod, so you can listen to The Streaks while you gasp for air!

Stewie:
 Oh, The Strokes, right.

Mort:
 Boy, this was a better aquisition than I thought. We may even be able to put in some sorghum this year.

Stewie:
 So, uh, anyway, um, hey! I made you a mix tape! I don't have a dual cassette player, so I had to hold the tape recorder up to the radio, so the quality's kinda sucky, but, y'know, all the songs describe my feelings.

LaDonne:
 I'm sorry, Stewie. I'm just upset. Jeremy stopped calling me.

Stewie:
 HE WHAT? That blaggard! Oh, come here, let me just, let me just hold you for a while.

LaDonne:
 Stewie, NO! That is a bad place to touch! No! No no no no no no no.

Stewie:
 B-But...but I...I...you...I...Waaaaaaaah! [Stewie starts crying]

LaDonne:
 No more TV!

Stewie:
 Well, how about no more job? Hmm? You hear that miss fussybritches? I shall see you fired, damn you! I thought we were going to go all the way and die together like Hitler and Eva Braun!

Hitler:
 We do everything together, ja?

Eva:
 Ja.

Hitler:
 You got your poison?

Eva:
 Mmm.

Hitler:
 Ok, one...two...three.

Hitler:
 You didn't do it!

Eva:
 You didn't do it either!

Hitler:
 Ok, ok, all right, this time we really have to do it. Ok, ready? Ok.

BOTH:
 One, two...

EVA:
 You want me to kill myself and you're not going to! You suck! You suck!

HITLER:
 You suck!

Brian:
 Hey Stewie, there's something thunkin' around in the trunk of my car and I can't get in there because somebody busted the lock. You have, uh, any idea what that's about?

Stewie:
 Oh? Oh, that, pfft. It's this whole, it's this whole crazy thing.

Lois:
 Hey, this is not a barn, young lady.

Meg:
 Ugg, I'm just so exhausted! You know, I thought I'd be happy being with Neil, but I'm not! This is horrible! {starts crying}

Lois:
 Oh, sweetheart, we'll figure out some way to get you out of this. Brian, did you find any loopholes in the contract?

Brian:
 Nope, it's airtight. The only way out is if Neil commits an infidelity.

Peter:
 Well, that's it then, we gotta find somebody to seduce Neil.

Lois:
 Who, me?

Peter:
 Well, if not you Lois, than who? Beverly D'Angelo? Cause I don't think she'd do it. And I don't even know how to get a hold of her.

Stewie:
 Oh, hello, LaDonne. Listen, I certainly hope you'll excuse last night's indescretion, it was just--oh my God, LaDonne! What's that on your neck?

Stewie:
 LOIS! Oh thank God you're here, Lois! It was all her friends, they, they were doing marijuana and heroin! (pronounces it "haro-een" and marijuana, "mara-ju-ana") And they were taking Exema and touching each other!

Lois:
 LaDonne, wake up this instant! {kicks LaDonne}

LaDonne:
 Wha? I dunno...

Lois:
 You know what? Don't bother LaDonne! You are fired!

LaDonne:
 Well, I really don't know how this happened, but I guess this is the last time I get to see you. I'm...I'm gonna miss you, little guy. Oh {reaches into purse, pulls out a tape} this is for you.

Stewie:
 She...she made me a mix tape?! Oh dear God, what have I done?! I've made a terrible mistake!

Peter:
 All right, you all set honey?

Lois:
 {from inside the room} Oh, I can't believe I'm doing this. It's so disgusting, but it's for my little girl.

Meg:
 Dad, how do you know Neil will show up?

Peter:
 Don't worry, Meg. I sent him an invitation he couldn't refuse.

Neil:
 Hmm....strange...these conventions usually have Segway parking.

Neil:
 Hello? Am I too late for the Q and A?

Lois:
 Yeah, but you're just in time for the T and A. {growls}

Neil:
 Mrs. Griffin! What are you--

Lois:
 Shh, you can call me Mystique.

Neil:
 Mrs. Griffin! This is wrong!

Peter:
 Well, well, well. Look at this, Meg. Your boyfriend is violating both your contract and my wife.

Neil:
 Meg! I wasn't doing anything! Mrs. Griffin was just-- OWW, you're bending it.

Meg:
 I don't care. You've nullified the contract. I'm free! {laughs}

Neil:
 Free? I don't understand, Meg. You don't want to be my girlfriend?

Meg:
 Well, I thought I did, but I guess I was just jealous.

Neil:
 I see. Well, Meg, I want you to be with me because you WANT to be with me, not because you have to.

Meg:
 Thank you, Neil.

Neil:
 Cecilia? It's The Gold-man. How 'bout we fire up the ol' Segway and find a nice, quiet field to do long division in? I-I mean 'a nice, quiet field in which to do long division', sorry. {holds hand up to the phone} Sorry, everybody. {back to talking on the phone} Ok, I'm on my way.

Meg:
 He's going back to Cecilia? I can't believe I'm actually jealous.

Lois:
 I can't believe I actually touched him.

Peter:
 I still can't believe it's not butter! {laughs} Next week, I run for mayor of Quahog. Do I have what it takes? We'll find out, don't miss it.

Meg:
 Well, here we are again. Another Saturday night with basic cable.

Stewie:
 Yep. {sigh} I suppose none of us are really cut out for love, and we--OH MY GOD! JEREMY'S STILL IN THE TRUNK! Oh God, how long's it been? Uh...let's see...two weeks, yep. Yep, he's dead. Definitely dead.

Peter:
 Everybody, I got bad news: We've been canceled!

Lois:
 Oh, no! Peter, how could they do that?

Peter:
 Well, unfortunately, Lois, there's just no more room on the schedule. We've just got to accept the fact that Fox has to make room for terrific shows like Dark Angel, Titus, Undeclared, Action, That 80's Show, Wonderfalls, Fastlane, Andy Richter Controls the Universe, Skin, Girl's Club, Cracking Up, The Pitts, Firefly, Get Real, Freaky Links, Wanda at Large, Costello, The Lone Gunmen, A Minute with Stan Hooper, Normal, Ohio, Pasadena, Harsh Realm, Keen Eddie, The Street, American Embassy, Cedric the Entertainer, The Tick, Luis, and Greg the Bunny.

Peter:
 Well, I suppose if all those shows go down the tubes we might have a shot.

Brian:
 What are you watching, Peter?

Peter:
 Passion of the Christ. I tell you, Brian, I can't believe that this guy is just lying there taking it. If it was me, I would have done something about it

Cut Scene:
 Peter is being lashed with a cat-"o"-nine-tails.

Peter:
 AH! AH! AH! AH! AH! AH! AH! AH! AH! Hey, hey, hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop it. Stop it.

Guard:
 OK.

Peter:
 OK?

Lois:
 Hi boys.

Peter:
 I didn't have my hands down my pants!

Lois:
 Hmmmm, good for you. I got us some new sheets from Bed, Bath, and Beyond

Peter:
 Oh boy, I hope you stayed away from the "Beyond" section.

Scene:
 Peter approaches the "Beyond" Section. He opens the doors and enters a space-time void.

Peter:
 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH--Oh, here are the coffee mugs.

Lois:
 Honey, what do you say we, uh, christen these new sheets, huh?

Peter:
 Why, Lois Griffin, you naughty girl.

Lois:
 *giggles* That's me.

Lois:
 *chuckles*

Peter:
 You filthy, stinking prostitute.

Lois:
 Haha-OK, I get it.

Peter:
 You foul, venereal-disease-carrying, street-walking whore.

Lois:
 All right, that's enough!

Stewie:
 Aaaah, it's good to have land.

Lois:
 Oh, oh.... GEORGE!

Peter:
 George? Who the hell is George?!

Lois:
 George Clooney?

Peter:
 Our sex is so dull for you that you got to fantasize about George Clooney?

Lois:
 I'm sorry, honey, I guess that things have become a little stale for me.

Peter:
 Well I, I don't know what to do, I mean I don't really know that much about any kinky stuff. I mean I, I could hook this car battery up to my nipples. AH! AH! AH! AH! OH GOD! OW! OW! OW! OW! OW! OW! This doing it for ya? OW! OW! OW! OW! OW!

Lois:
 Oh, I don't know. I just don't feel that spark anymore; I mean... our honeymoon, ah so much rugburn!

Peter:
 Wait a second, Lois, that's what we need. We'll go on a second honeymoon!

Lois:
 *gasp* Peter, that's a wonderful idea!

Peter:
 Yeah, we'll be just like "The Honeymooners."

Ralph:
 One of these days, Alice. One of these days.

Alice:
 Yeah, yeah I know, Ralph; Right to the moon.

Lois:
 Well that's everything. Now, remember, kids, Brian is in charge while your father and I are out at Cape Cod.

Brian:
 I'll take good care of them, Lois, you guys have a good time.

Group:
 Bye.

Chris:
 Bye, mom, I LOVE YOU!

Stewie:
 You know, Brian if i choose to make stool in my pants right now, you're the only one here to change me. What do you think of that? Hmmmmm?

Brian:
 I'm not going to change you.

Brian:
 I said I'm not going to change you.

Stewie:
 Oh you can't be serious. What if--what if i make a fudgie? Well I just wont. I just won't, that's all, I just won't. BLAST! I just did.

Meg:
 AH! Chris, cut it out. Brian, Chris just picked his nose and he keeps touching me with his finger!

Chris:
 What good is mining nose gold if i cant share it with the townspeople?

Brian:
 I swear to god, these kids are going to make me put a bullet through my head.

Stewie:
 Well, if I was in charge, we wouldn't be having this problem right now.

Brian:
 Well, you've got some ideas, tell me.

Stewie:
 Oh I'll tell you of course. I'll want a favor in exchange.

Stewie:
 Ahahaha how does it smell, dog, does it smell like servitude? Ahaha! Aft torpedos fire!

Peter:
 Lois? Hey, Lois, honey? Sweetheart? Peter swerves the car so Lois hits her head on the window. Oh you,re awake, hey, will you pass me the pretzels?

Lois:
 Peter, where are we?

Peter:
 About two hours from Cape Cod's most luxurious Bed & Breakfast.

Lois:
 Oh, Peter, this is going to be so wonderful I'm so excited i want to prep my diaphragm right now.

Peter:
 Hehehe. Gross. Hey why don't you go back to sleep? I'll wake you when we get there.

Lois:
 Ok.

Peter:
 Hehehehehe, look at all those hamburgers. You can't eat all those hamburgers, you stupid fellow--Peter realizes he's swerving off the road. Oh jeeze! Peter rights the car and then slides the comic back up. Oh! he's going to do it. Oh, he's so ridiculous. You hear me, you ridiculous man?? You're -- whoa!!!

Lois:
 Peter, what the hell is wrong with you? I fall asleep for ten minutes and you plow the car into a tree? Oh my god, you got to pay attention to the road! We could have been killed! Will you look at the front of our car? It's totaled, it's completely totaled! Oh this is terrific, how are we gonna get--oh my god, I knew I should have driven. I should always drive. I can not trust you--

Lois:
 Dear God, this is where we're sleeping?

Peter:
 Aw, come on Lois. They said they'd have the car fixed by tomorrow and then our second honeymoon's [is this wrong?] be right back on track, eh?

Lois:
 Peter, there's a hooker on the bed.

Hooker:
 Hi

Hooker:
 where'd you go?

TV Announcer:
 And now back to "Two and a Half Men"

Torso:
 AAAAAAAAAH! Help me!

Meg:
 Turn it Chris, I wanna watch George Lopez.

Chris:
 That show only encourages the stereotype that George Lopez is funny. Give me that.

Meg:
 Chris give me the remote. Chris stop. Chris! Chris grabs her hat. *gasp* My hat!

Chris:
 stuffs the hat down his pants. Ahahaha! Wear it now!

Brian:
 Hey, uh, uh, you two better settle down. Chris, give Meg her hat.

Chris:
 I don't have to listen to you. You're a dog; you don't have a soul.

Brian:
 Ow.

Stewie:
 Don't take that. Raise your voice to them.

Brian:
 HEY! Knock it off! Chris and Meg immediately behave. You kids are obviously in need of some type of activity so uh I don't know what do you say we read a book or something. Stewie, What does Peter have on his bookshelf?

Stewie:
 Uh, two "Garfield" books and the novelization of the movie "Caddyshack."

Brian:
 Reading to everyone. "Nananananananananana," said Ty, sinking yet another ball. "Nananananananananana." phone rings Oh hang on.

Meg:
 Oh thank god.

Stewie:
 Reading Garfield at Large by Jim Davis. Now as you can see in this panel, Garfield doesn't care for Nermal. But like him or not, Nermal is here to stay! Or is he? Let's read on.

Brian:
 over phone OK, I'll be there. To Stewie Peter and Lois were supposed to chaperone Chris's school dance tomorrow night. So I guess it's up to me.

Stewie:
 You mean it's up to us. Clearly you need my help with this parenting thing you're too stupid to do it alone. Besides I know how to deal with children unlike Mr. Gepetto.

Gepetto:
 Oh no, I dropped my glasses. bends over, away from Pinocchio, to pick them up. Uh, by the way, Pinocchio, there was a cookie missing from the jar. Did you, uh did you take it by any chance?

Pinocchio:
 Yes, papa Gepetto, I'm sorry.

Gepetto:
 Are you sure you took it? Because I'd believe you if you said you didn't.

Pinocchio:
 No I took it, papa. I wouldn't lie to you.

Gepetto:
 You could try and, who knows, you might get away with it.

Peter:
 900 bucks to fix the car that was all the money we had for this trip.

Lois:
 the second honeymoon was a sepcial thought but maybe we should just go home

Tom Tucker:
 Coming up, handsome moustachioed man recaps news in pleasing baritone. Stay tuned for this and more.

Diane Simmons:
 But first, Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa is on hand for the opening of Manhattan's newest luxury hotel.

Tricia Takanawa:
 Diane, I'm standing outside the Park Barrington Hotel, because they dont allow Asians inside.

Peter:
 Fancy place. Boy, that would make some second honeymoon, huh?

Tricia Takanawa:
 The Park Barrington is already attracting some big names, such as Christianity enthusiast Mel Gibson who has his own room on permannt reserve. A room which he barely uses.

Peter:
 Barely uses, huh? Lois, I just got an idea much better than that time I experimented with gene splicing.

Peter:
 Uh, Lois, quick question: do we have any tylenol?

Stewie:
 Oh, how I envy them, dog. They've got their whole lives ahead of them.

Brian:
 Oh man, look at that kid. That is one ugly eighth grader.

Herbert:
 You dont want to hurt yourself dancing. Make sure you stretch out those creamy hamstrings.

Friend:
 Come on Chris its just vodka. Jake swiped it from his dad's liquor cabinet.

Jake:
 Yeah, see? it's good!

Chris:
 Well, OK maybe just one sip

Teacher:
 Christopher Griffin, is that alcohol? Mister, you are in serious trouble.

 Joe:
 He's absolutely right, kids, because when you drink nobody wins. In fact last year alone there were over 27,000 deaths from chronic liver disease as a result of alcohol abuse.

Kids:
 Now we know!

 Joe:
 And knowing is half the battle!

Lois:
 Peter, we can't afford this.

Peter:
 No, but Mel Gibson can. Puts on hat, flips up collar, and approaches desk Uh, excuse me, I'm Mel Gisbon here for the key to my specially reserved room.

Clerk:
 You're Mel Gibson?

Peter:
 Yes, I've put on a few pounds for my next role. I play Peter Griffin a heroic warrior who defied the English, to free England from the English.

Clerk:
 Holy mackerel! Let me show you to your room, Mr. Gibson.

Lois:
 Peter, the toilet paper is made of money.

Peter:
 Yeah, and look at this: they even have some of that high class English porn.

Man on TV:
 Almost...almost...almost....there we are.

Woman on TV:
 Well done.

Stewie:
 Did you think you were "cool"? did you think you were "grown-up"?

Chris:
 I didn't actually drink any of it. Besides, Jake Tucker gave it to me.

Stewie:
 Well, we are going to have a talk with Jake's parents tomorrow after my burping.

Brian:
 In the meantime, you're grounded.

Chris:
 Aw, that sucks.

Stewie:
 Do you want us to pull over?

Chris:
 I don't care what you do.

Stewie:
 Oh we'll pull over. We'll pull over. Pull over.

Chris:
 AAH! ahaha!! WAAAAH!

Stewie:
 If your teachers ask about your bruises, what do you tell them?

Chris:
 I got hit by a baseball! WAAAAAAH! aaaah!

Peter:
 Heheheheh!

Lois:
 Ooooooh, Mel!

Peter:
 turns on the light. Mel? Wait a minute, you were fantasizing about Mel Gibson. You--you don't find me attractive anymore.

Lois:
 Honey, I'm sorry, I know you're trying but you can't rush the spark back into our marriage.

Peter:
 Well, then I guess this whole second honeymoon was a waste of time. I don't want to talk about it. I'm just going to watch british porn.

Man on TV:
 You know, Maragaret, we could have sexual intercourse right now.

Woman on TV:
 Yes, yes, we could.

Man on TV:
 Hmmm, but let's not.

Stewie:
 Do you think we were too hard on Chris tonight?

Brian:
 What? oh no no no I don't think so. Do you?

Stewie:
 Oh no, I just always feel bad when we have to be strict. Ah, did I remember to turn the stove off? Yes.

Lois:
 I'm sorry for everything that's happened, Peter. I guess I'm going through a phase right now where I'm only attracted to handsome men.

Peter:
 Well, what are we supposed to do, Lois,just admit that there's no excitement left in our marriage, go home and spend the rest of our lives looking at each other across the breakfast table talking about how much we both like Total?

Lois:
 Oh, I love Total.

Peter:
 Ooooh, actually, so do I, and it's healthy for you too--oh god it's startin' already. Lois we are screwed.

Lois:
 Woooow. Mel Gibson's secret screenin' room

Peter:
 Hey, what's this?

Announcer:
 In the year 33 AD.

Guy:
 The messiah! He's gone!

Other guy:
 Where did he go?

Chris Tucker:
 Man you crazy, Jesus! You crazy!

Jesus:
 That's what my ex-wife said.

Chris Tucker:
 For the son of God, you sure are the son of a--WHoooaa!

Announcer:
 Chris Tucker. And Jim Ca--Caziva---Cav-Caviziel? Is that it? The guy from the first one? Passion of the Christ 2: Crucify This!

Jesus:
 holds a gun out for Chris Tucker. You know how to use one of these?

Chris Tucker:
 holds a joint out for Jesus. You know how to use one of these?

Announcer:
 This July, let he who is without sin kick the first ass.

Peter:
 Oh man, that's all we need: more Mel Gibson Jesus mumbo jumbo. Well, not if I have anything to say about it. I am going to make sure this never sees the lght of day

Lois:
 Peter, are you crazy? Stealing Mel Gibson's towels, bathrobes, and nazi paraphernelia is one thing, but this is a multi-million dollar film an he's a very powerful man he could have us arrested or killed.

Peter:
 Well it's worth the risk, Lois. To save the world another 2 hours of torture. We've got to get rid of this thing for the sake of Jesus and Snoopy and all the other beloved children's characters.

Priest:
 Pardon me. We work for Mel Gibson. Seems he left something very valuable in his room and we're here to retrieve it.

Clerk:
 Mr. Gibson just checked out a moment ago. There he goes now.

Peter:
 Uh-oh. lois, run.

Priest:
 Hey! Stop!

Clerk:
 Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

Lois:
 They're gaining on us. Oh, we never should've stolen this film.

Peter:
 Oh, man. This is even more intense than that time I forgot how to sit down.

Peter:
 Don't worry, Lois, I think I know how to lose em.

Peter:
 Lois trust me. How many times have I done this before?

Lois:
 All right, but be careful.

Brian:
 OK, now be polite and for God's sake don't mention anything about his kid's face

Stewie:
 Oh, shut up. I am alwys so polite.

Brian:
 Heh, I hope we dont wind up on the evening news because of this.

Stewie:
 He he he. You're funny.

Tom Tucker:
 Ah Brian! Please come in. Can my wife, Stacy get you anything?

Stacy Tucker :
Go to hell, Tom.

Tom Tucker:
 Already there, hon.

Brian:
 Well, uh, Mr. Tucker it seems your son Jake had some vodka at the school dance and Chris got blamed for it. This, uh, this whole situation has turned his life upside-down face.

Tom Tucker:
 Well it's no concern of mine if it turned his life upside-down face. Jakes a good boy, aren't you Jake?

Jake Tucker:
 Yeah!

Brian:
 Look Mr. Tucker I...

Tom Tucker:
 We're though here. Get out of my house Benji!

Brian:
 Well fine, if you're going to be that way about it maybe I'll do this.

Brian:
 Yeah, look at this.

Tom Tucker:
 Stop that!

Brian:
 Oh yeah, you don't like that.

Tom Tucker:
 Stop doing that on my carpet.

Brian:
 This is what Benji would do.

Tom Tucker:
 Stop it! Stop it!

Brian:
 It feels so good, it feels so good.

Brian:
 There's got to be a way to get back at Jake Tucker for what he did to Chris.

Stewie:
 I know, I know, I know, let's plant drugs in his locker.

Brian:
 Oh my god, that's a great idea.

Stewie:
 I thought you'd like that. Hey look at that Yosemite Sam mudflap. You better stay back Brian. nyeeeh.

Peter:
 *sigh* Think we lost 'em. You stay here I'm gunna go bury this film.

Peter:
 Well Mel Gibson, this is one piece of crap the world will never have to suffer through. Hehehehe, I am so clever. That's why they picked me to convince Congress to go to war.

Man at Podium:
 There is no just cause for an invasion of Iraq.

Peter:
 Well that may be, but what we're all forgetting is anyone who doesn't want to go to war, is gay.

All of Congress:
 Oh yes, yes yes yes, (ect.)

Speaker of the House:
 I was the first one who wanted to go to war!

Peter:
 (while running) AAAH!

Lois:
 Aaaah! Peter!

The note says:
 Bring the film to my house on the top of Mount Rushmore in three days, or your wife dies --M. Gibson (camera pans down) Also, don't miss "Bird on a Wire", Tuesday night on TBS Superstation." (The letter is in all caps).

Mel Gibson:
 Don't take this personally Mrs. Griffin. I'm doing this because I have to.

Lois:
 What are you gonna do? (in suductive tone) Oh, what are you gonna do to me?

Mel Gibson:
 As soon as your husband gives me what I want, you're free to go.

Peter:
 Anybody home?

Lois:
 *gasp* Peter!

Peter:
 All right, Gibson I want my wife back...or a woman of equal physical attractiveness.

Mel Gibson:
 Where's the film?

Peter:
 Come on, honey let's get out of here.

Lois:
 Peter you're just going to give him the film?

Peter:
 Don't worry Lois there's a dog turd in there, but by the time he finds out well be long go--

Mel Gibson:
 There's a dog turd in here.

Peter:
 Uh-oh. Lois...

Peter:
 Jump!

 Lois:
 Aaaah!

Mel Gibson:
 No, wait! I'll deal with them myself.

Lois:
 We're on top of the monument.

 Lois:
 Ah!

Peter:
 You know I know this is the wrong time to be starstruck but, Mel Gibson is shooting at us.

Lois:
 Peter help!

Peter:
Aw, man. I'm comin' Lois.

Peter:
 Heheheheh. Look, Lois im a booger. Hehhehe.

Lois:
 Peter for god's sake.

Peter:
 Ok, Ok, grab my hand.

 Lois:
 *gasp*

Mel Gibson:
 And now Mr Griffin, I want that film.

Peter:
 Oh sure it's right over there in President Rushmore's mouth.

Lois:
 Oh my god, he just walked right over the edge.

Peter:
 Of course he did, Christians don't believe in gravity.

Lois:
 Peter it's back.

Peter:
 What that rash?

Lois:
 No no the spark. Honey I have never been more attracted to you than I am right now.

Peter:
 Really wow, so I guess this honeymoon was just the kind of excitement our marriage needed. I guess it just goes to show that...

Lois:
 Shutup and let's do it.

Lois:
 Oh, oh, oh Peter!

Peter:
 YES!

George Washington:
 Hey Jefferson check it out. Chick gettin nailed on my head.

Thomas Jefferson:
 Sweet. Hey Teddy pass the word down to Frankenstein.

Abraham Lincolin:
 Oh ha ha.

Tom Tucker:
 In local news a Buddy Cianci Jr. high school student has been arrested for possession of drugs. The student has been sentenced to 200 hours of community service and is a very bad boy. We now go to Ollie Williams for the punishment forecast. Ollie.

Ollie Williams:
 HE GON GET IT!

Tom Tucker:
 Thanks Ollie. Now this.

Meg:
 So you actually put coke in that kid's locker?

Brian:
 Yup.

Meg:
 Wow, where'd you get it.

Brian:
 Oh I got a guy.

up deaf guy:
 Dont let it get the best of you. I used to be a lawyer. See you next week. Good to be back, America.

Joe:
 Can't blame them for being self-righteous. The black ball's in their neighborhood uninvited.

Cleveland:
 The black ball's done nothing wrong.

Joe:
 If the black ball's innocent, it has nothing to fear.

Peter:
 Huh. Wonder what the hell's down there. Peter sticks his head inside. Judd Hirsch?

Judd Hirsch:
 Uh... hey.

Peter:
 What, uh... What's goin' on?

Judd Hirsch:
 Nothin'.

Lois:
 Hi, boys! Your ride is here.

Peter:
 Hey, you're just in time. Mort's one ball away from a perfect game.

Mort:
 Oh, God, the pressure's too much. I just lost control of my bladder. Oh, why didn't I clothespin the end of my penis like Muriel told me to?

Cleveland:
 Oh, my God, you bowled a perfect game.

Group:
 Mort!

Joe:
 Grr-yeah!

Group:
 All right, Mort!

Mort:
 I just never stopped believing. Say no to acid!

Peter:
 Geez, relax, Mort. You'd think you were God Himself.

Mort:
 No, He's over there.

God:
 Hey. You wanna see what I can do? All right, ready? Check it out. Beer. Glass. All right? Now watch this. Oh, Hey, guess I'll go over here for a minute. (Humming) Oh, holy crap, that's still pouring itself. Oh, wow. Oh, that's amazing. I've never seen anyone do that. You wanna go out later?

Lois:
 I'll be right back. I'm gonna go tinkle.

Peter:
 Okay, everybody ready? Hey, where's Quagmire? In the bathroom. Lois searches for a toilet seat cover but there are none. She has to use toilet paper instead.

Quagmire:
 giggety-gig... Gig-gig-giggy. Giggety-gig, gig, giggety, giggety. (Groaning) Would you just sit down and go to the bathroom, already?!

Diane Simmons:
 A scandal at the Quahog Bowling Alley tonight, where a local man, Glenn Quagmire, was charged with peeping in the ladies' room.

Tom Tucker:
 Coming up: Diane's weight.

Officer:
 He's all yours, Joe.

Joe:
 You know, you're lucky I've got some extra pull around here thanks to my eighteen medals for heroism.

Peter:
 Sheesh, there he goes again with the medals. Hey, Joe, if you love your medals so much, why don't you marry 'em? (Chuckles) I-I did something like that once.

Lawyer:
 And in the event of your death, you'd like the insurance policy to be paid to your wife?

Peter:
 Yep.

Lawyer:
 And your wife is this piece of pie?

Peter:
 You got it. Love you.

Lawyer:
 Okay... sign here.

Peter:
 You know what? You can probably go ahead and cancel that.

Lois:
 Well, well, look who's here.

Peter:
 All right, all right. Look, I know an apology is due here. So, Lois, tell Quagmire you're sorry you had him arrested.

Lois:
 Excuse me? He's the one who owes me an apology. He was watching me go to the bathroom!

Peter:
 Well, clearly he thinks you're attractive, Lois. It's a positive thing. Thank you, Glenn, for complimenting our family.

Loretta:
 We have had it with his disrespect for women. We're petitioning the city to have him removed from the neighborhood.

Bonnie:
 Yeah. I don't want to bring a new baby into the world with him running around.

Peter:
 Okay, first of all, Bonnie, you've been pregnant for, like, six years, all right, either have the baby or don't. Second of all, Quagmire's a good guy. He's just a little mixed up.

Man:
 This isn't medium-rare.

Woman:
 Then have them take it back.

Peter:
 Sorry about that. Second of all, Quagmire's a good guy. You know, he's just a little mixed up, that's all. Come on, give him another chance, yeah?

Lois:
 All right, but one more incident like the one at the bowling alley, and Quagmire is out of this neighborhood.

Peter:
 Now don't worry about a thing, Quagmire. Your pals are gonna help you change your ways.

Quagmire:
 I don't know, Peter. I'm not sure I can do this. He sees trees and things transform into beautiful women. Then he sees Meg. Meg, get out of the way. A fire hydrant turns into a beautiful woman.

Cleveland:
 All right, Glenn, this exercise should help teach you self-control.

Joe:
 Here's this month's Victoria's Secret catalogue.

Quagmire:
 Oh, God! Oh, God! Uh, uh, uh, dead kittens, dead kittens! Uh, old nuns. Really old nuns. Uh, Renee Zellweger! Oh, there we go.

Peter:
 Heyyy, good, good, good.

Joe:
 Uh, yeah.

Lois:
 Peter, are you sure Quagmire is ready to be out in public?

Peter:
 Nothing to worry about, Lois. We figured out a foolproof rehabilitation method. I got the idea from when Brian had to wear that cone after his operation.

Stewie:
 Okay, okay. If I make this, we're all gonna get laid... ha-ha! Yes! Score! Score!

Brian:
 Boy, I'd really like to chew on my crotch right now.

Peter:
 Okay, Quagmire, time to take off your training wheels.

Quagmire:
 *Sighs* OK. I think I'm ready. Quagmire sees lots of attractive girls in the mall. He groans. Oh, boy.

Peter:
 What's the matter, Glenn?

Quagmire:
 Uh... nothing.

Cheerleader:
 Oh, Stacey, you dropped your pom-pom in the water.

Second cheerleader:
 I'll get it for you.

Stacey:
 I'll come with you.

Cheerleader:
 Me, too.

Second Cheerleader:
 But wait a minute. We don't want to get our sweaters all wet. Better take 'em off.

Stacey:
 Splash fight!

Quagmire:
 *moans* I-I need... I need some air! I need some air! (panting) (screams) Naked plastic chicks! (screams) Where... Where am I? Am I dead?

Security Guard:
 No, this is where we monitor all the dressing rooms in the mall, so we can keep an eye out for shoplifters.

Quagmire:
 You don't say. Oh my God, that one's having a heart attack!

Quagmire:
 What the hell's CPR?

Horace:
 Congratulations, Quagmire. You're the newest member of my Wall of Fame.

Joe:
 What's wrong, Peter?

Peter:
 Oh, it's nothing, Joe. It's... I dunno... it's just that... all you guys have something to be Proud of, you know? Quagmire got a key to the city. Mort bowled a perfect game. You're always getting medals for catchin' crooks. Hell, even Cleveland used to be an accomplished auctioneer.

Cleveland:
 very rapidly I have 125. Do I hear 130? 130,000 For this authentic Comanche headdress? I got one-30. I got one-30. Do I hear one-35? One-40. Do I hear one-for...? An assistant knocks over a totem pole whic knocks Cleveland in the head. He changes to a slow monotone. One-35 going once.

Peter:
 I'm the only one here who's got nothin'. You know, if I died tomorrow, there's nothin' people would remember me for.

Cleveland:
 Not if you jumped off a skyscraper and landed on Joan Cusack. People would say, "Hey, remember that guy who landed on Joan Cusack?"

Peter:
 Well, things are gonna change. From this day forth, people are gonna know the name Peter Griffin. Even If I have to shout it from the rooftops. On the roof of The Drunken Clam You hear that, world?! I am gonna do something that people will remember me for! He loses his balance and falls over the edge. Whoa! Oh, oh, God. Sorry, sorry... Hey! Joan Cusack! Hello? Uh-oh. He stuffs Joan Cusack's body in a mailbox and walks away.

Brian:
 Peter, If you just let me talk, I'll explain to you why you shouldn't do this.

Peter:
 Later, later, Brian. I gotta do something people will remember me for. Which is why I've invented a new type of flying machine.

Stewie:
 You know, I vaguely recall seeing footage somewhere of something exactly like this that, uh... leads me to believe this probably won't work.

Peter:
 All right, stewie, let 'er rip!

Elves:
 Ya! All right, we attack the Rice Krispy guys at dawn. Assuming Judd Hirsch delivers the goods.

Peter:
 Brian, this time I think I got just the thing people will remember me for. I am gonna stop pollution with my new, lovable character, Gary the No-trash Cougar. Yelling: pick up your trash! screaming: I wanna know whose cup this is! I said, I wanna know whose cup this is! A frightened girl timidly raises her hand. Pick it up! Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up! gently: Thank you, sweetie. See what a nicer place this is when we all pitch in? Like Gary the No-trash Cougar says: give a larbage, throw out your garbage. Spread the word! He fires his gun into the air and leaves the room.

Pop:
 Those freakin' elves, man. They just came out of the trees, man. They just came out of the trees.

Crackle:
 You saved my ass back there.

Pop:
 You saved mine.

Crackle:
 Here's to Snap.

Crackle:
 To Snap.

Peter:
 Ah, this sucks. I've been workin' on this all week and I keep comin' up dry. Who am I kiddin'? I'm never gonna be remembered for anything. Not like my great, great uncles, the siamese twins who fought each other in the Civil War.

Barkeeper:
 Not too smart, huh?

Cleveland:
Peter, you have to stop comparing yourself to other people and find out what's special about you.

Tom Tucker:
 (on TV) In sadder news, the man who held the Guinness World Record for most drugs ever done by a single human being died today. He was attacked by a pack of wild dogs... he thought he saw.

Mort:
 Ooh, there you go, Peter. You could break a world record.

Peter:
 What are you, nuts? I got no special talents. What can I do that nobody else does?

Horace the Bartender:
 Well, you just ate my tip.

Peter:
 I got it!

Lois:
 Peter, you're really putting away those Mentos.

Peter:
 Oh, these aren't Mentos, Lois. Everybody, you're lookin' at a guy who's gonna set a new world record. I am gonna eat more nickels than anyone has ever eaten before! Settin' this world record is gonna make me famous. Just like the world's fattest twins over there.

Right Fat Twin:
 Did I tell you that I'm doing Atkins?

Left Fat Twin:
 Oh, that's not good for you.

Meg:
 Dad, I just don't hear it.

Peter:
 C'mon!

Brian:
 Really, Peter. It just doesn't...

Peter:
 You're telling me that doesn't sound like "Camptown Races"?!

Brian:
 Not one bit.

Chris:
 (Laughs) Do "Short People."

Stewie:
 Ugh, this is the worst use of money since I tricked out my big wheel.

Stewie:
 Hey, ladies! Check out this ride! Huh?! Yeah! I'm off to make trouble for the establishment!

Peter:
 I love you, Lois.

Lois:
 Ooo, I love you too Peter. Even if you are full of nickels.

Peter:
 Good night, honey.

Peter:
 Oh my God! Lois! I can't see!

 Hartman:
 Uh, how about now?

Peter:
 No, nothin'.

 Hartman:
 Well, that makes me feel much better. You can't see the spaceship, either. My cousin Marshall insists if you look past the picture, you can see a spaceship...

Lois:
 Can you please just tell us what's wrong with my husband?

 Hartman:
 Oh, yes. Uh, well, you see, after ingesting such a large number of metal coins, Mr. Griffin appears to have succumbed to nickel poisoning, causing him to lose his sight.

Peter:
 Oh my God, Lois. I'm blind as a bat! I can't see a damn thing.

Tumbler Man:
 You know what else you can't see? The writing on the wall. Vaudeville's dead. And TV's the box they're gonna bury it in. Back then, everybody had a specialty. I, for one, am a tumbler. Watch me leap through this big hoop.

Tumbler Man:
 Vamp, vamp!

Lois:
 So we're all gonna have to pitch in and help your father out, now that he's lost his sight.

Meg:
 Nobody took care of me when I lost my arms and legs and was struck blind, deaf and dumb.

Peter:
 Hey, Hey, Meg, they got a Happy Days spoof in here, but they call it Crappy Days. (Laughing)

Peter:
 All right, you know what? If you're not gonna laugh, then I'm not gonna keep you company.

Peter:
 This sucks. Now the only thing anybody's gonna remember me for after I die is being, "That Blind Guy."

Brian:
 Don't give up yet, Peter. I mean, many blind people lead rich, fulfilling lives.

Peter:
 Oh, I don't know, Brian. I mean, I guess I can give it a shot.

Stewie:
 (Laughs) Oh my God! I almost didn't do it. I almost didn't do it. I thought, is this in bad taste? But you know what, I went for it. I went for it and I am so glad I did. Ohh, worth it, totally worth it.

Peter:
 Still awake, Lois, honey?

Peter:
 Thats right, I'm your daddy. Shh, shh, shh; don't talk, Lois, don't talk. Just let me do all the work. Yeah, you feel my warm breath on the nape of your neck? My hands on your big soft boobs, moving down your big man like che--

Peter:
 Holy crap, it's Chris! Uh, ah, so, ah... how ya doing? You do all your homework? Finish all your subjects?

Peter:
 Good, Just, uh, just checkin'. Have a good night, son.

Peter:
 You still awake, honey?

Brian:
 Peter, what the hell is that?

Peter:
 Ah, this is my seeing eye dog, Brutus.

Brian:
 What do you need a seeing eye dog for?

Peter:
 Well, 'cause I can't do anything for myself, Brian. I can't drive, I don't know when to cross the street, and I took a dump in the church confessional, which I guess they frown upon If you're not homeless. I thought I could deal with being blind at first, but I don't know. I... I haven't felt this out of place since that week I lived with Superman.

Peter:
 Uh, Hi. Uh, sorry. I know you got a meetin' going on, but, um... So, we are officially running low on Mr. Pibb and Cheez-its. So, um, just putting it out there If you're heading to the store later. Uh... you know, uh... 800 mile drive for me, like, uh, five seconds for you. Whatever. I'm not here.

Brian:
 Peter, this is something you're still adjusting to. You can't expect to get used to it overnight.

Peter:
 Whatever you say, Brian. I'm going to the Clam.

Lois:
 Did Peter leave?

Brian:
 Yeah. Boy, he's really down about this.

Lois:
 Oh, I know. I'm so worried about him. I've been looking into support groups we could join to help him...

Brian:
 Are you... are-are you not wearing makeup?

Lois:
 Oh, no. I just... You know, since Peter went blind, it's actually been kinda nice not to have to worry about my appearance.

Brian:
 I see.

Lois:
 Is it really noticeable?

Brian:
 Well, a... little mascara wouldn't kill you.

Lois:
 (chuckles) I was kinda thinking I'd try an au natural thing.

Brian:
 You think, uh... You think you have the skin for that?

God:
 Oh, uh, let me light that for you, babe.

Woman:
 Wow.

God:
 Yeah, magic fingers.

God:
 Jesus Christ!

Jesus:
 What?

God:
 Get the Escalade. We're outta here.

Peter:
 Come on, girl. I'm thirsty.

Brutus:
(barks)

Peter:
 All right, you don't wanna come in? Fine. I'll just tie you to this parking meter.

Peter:
 Hey, Horace. Um, I'll have a Pawtucket Patriot.

Horace:
 (groaning)

Peter:
 So, how's your hammer hanging? (sniffing) Hey, somebody smokin' in here? Huh. Oh, hey, y-you ever watch that show "Scrubs"? Yeah, Lois had it on the other night, and I was kinda fading in and out, but, uh, you know, I was watchin' and I'm wonderin'... Which one is the funny guy?

Horace:
 (Grunts) Peter, grab my hand!

Peter:
 Geez, Horace, you been drinkin'?

Horace:
 Grab it and pull! Come on! Let's go!

Tom Tucker:
 And here comes the heroic blind man. Tell us, sir, how did you summon the courage to save your friend from that burning building?

Peter:
 That freakin' place was on fire?!

Tom Tucker:
 And there you have it. Coming up next... Watch me shave.

Lois:
 Oh! Peter, you're all right! Oh, I am so proud of you for saving Horace's life.

Brian:
 Yeah, Peter, you were amazing.

Reporter:
 We now return to Winona Ryder distracting from other speeches in history.

Abraham Lincoln:
 Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that-

Peter:
 Great news, everyone. The new smartphone from Crabapple is out.

Chris:
 The new Crabapple phone? Awesome!

Lois:
 We may not be able to afford to send you to college but we can afford to buy you all thousand dollar phones whenever we like.

Chris:
 I'm so old, I still remember when phones cost $800.

Peter:
 That's why I thought we'd all camp out in line. I wanna be the first to get the new phone. I don't care if it takes all day.

Lois:
 Don't you have work?

Peter:
 Eh, I wouldn't mind missing work. There's a secretary looking for reassurance about her overly short haircut.

Secretary:
 I saw it in a magazine ... I needed a fresh start ... STOP PRETENDING TO STARE AT YOUR PHONES AND JUST SAY YOU HATE IT!

Peter:
 Sir, I am trying to read.

Chris:
 Mom, will you tie my shoes?

Lois:
 Just wear the Velcro ones.

Chris:
 I look like a bus person with the Velcro ones.

Lois:
 Okay, everybody. Last tinkles and poos.

Meg:
 Gross, mom!

Lois:
 I'M A MOM! I have to say it.

Peter:
 Man, I can't wait for a new phone. Kids, time to gather up our old cords and chargers that no longer work and throw them in the garbage.

Brian:
 We can't do that. Don't you know a lot of discarded electronics end up in the ocean and kill sea turtles?

Peter:
 Well then, let's cut out the middle man.

Peter:
 GRRRR! I'm sorry, there's a new phone.

Russian Woman:
 Hey! Gold phone is mine! Already match fingernail.

Chris:
 I was here first! That's mine!

Russian Woman:
 Don't make me get my very hairy husband, or my very hairy son, or my very hairy daughter!

Chris:
 She wanted it more than me.

Lois:
 Peter, I'm just not sure it's such a great idea that everyone in the family got a new cell phone.

Stewie:
 Said the woman who voted for Trump. You never should have carried me into that booth.

Peter:
 It's fine, Lois. Plus, they won't stay new for long. I mean, how long do you think it's gonna be before Meg cracks her screen?

Brian:
 Did she really vote for Trump?

Stewie:
 I'm note sure. She just got me the new Playskool phone and I was just swamped with calls that day.

Meg:
 Good morning everybo-

Meg:
 Dammit!

Peter:
 She's just gonna keep it like that for the next three years.

Lois:
 AH! OH GOD! AAAAAH! AAAAAAH! MY ARM! MY ARM! PETER! AAAAAH! I'M ON FIRE! HELP ME PUT IT OUT!

Lois:
 Dammit! Those phones have turned you all into mindless drones! I knew this was would happen. Getting those things was a worse idea than when all those pop stars committed a skank robbery.

Iggy Azalea:
 Everybody put your hands up! This is a robbery!

Nicki Minaj:
 Just put the money and the giant buttpants in a bag and nobody gets hurt!

Banker:
 We don't have any giant butt pants!

Banker:
 [scared] Okay, okay! Give them the giant butt pants!

Nicki Minaj:
 And now, since we have yall's attention, we're gonna shriek our latest single into y'alls earholes.

Father Bob:
 Today's sermon is about perseverance. When I was run out of Boston by the spotlight team, I could have hung up my collar.

Lois:
 Oh my God, again? You guys have got to put those away! You can't be on your phones in here!

Peter:
 Relax, Lois. It's just stupid boring church. It's not like we're gonna miss anything.

Father Bob:
 But instead, I packed my bibles my Tootsie pops and headed down to Quahog, with a renewed sense of spirit and a renewed reverence for, [notices Jesus] Jesus Christ!?

Tom:
 What's going on in there, Ollie?

Ollie:
 HE CAME BACK!

Tom:
 How is he?

Ollie:
 MAD!

Tom:
 Thanks, Ollie.

Herbert:
 Let's get out of here, other altar boys!

Lois:
 That's it! Hand over those cell phones!

Peter:
 What!? But we just got these things.

Meg:
 Yeah, mom. That's not fair.

Chris:
 Meg's right. That's not fair!

Lois:
 I refuse to let technology turn my family into brain dead robots! In fact, you know what? We're finally going to Old Sturbridge village.

Chris:
 What's that?

Lois:
 It's a place, where you can see what life was like before all these screens. A place where people farmed their own food, make their own clothing, and read books for entertainment.

Peter:
 Oh, come on, Lois. You only wanna go to Old Sturbridge Village, cuz you once got hand blasted there on a field trip.

Stewie:
 Yes, let's just say the candles weren't the only things being hot dipped.

Chris:
 That place is scary. It reminds me of The Handmaid's Tale.

Meg:
 Yeah. Don't make us go there mom. That place is so lame.

Lois:
 Sorry, gang, but we're going to Old Sturbridge Village.

Jesus:
 Hey, I'm really sorry for all this. My girlfriend just broke up with me and she says she's not giving me back my dog ... and I skipped breakfast. Will you forgive me?

Chris:
 Are you kidding? You're Jesus. We have to forgive you.

Jesus:
 Oh, great. Great. Hey, while I got you guys here, would it be cool if I crashed in your garage until I can figure out this dog situation?

Chris:
 And this is why you should never go to church.

TV Announcer:
 We now return to Alien vs. Predator vs. The People vs. O.J. Simpson.

Xenomorph:
 If it does not fit, you must lay eggs in people's stomach against their will, until they explode.

Ten:
 Objection, your honor.

Judge:
 On what grounds?

Ten:
 On muddy grounds, preferably in the jungle, where one could ambush a group of highly-trained green berets.

Sarah Paulson:
 Your honor, the predator is making a mockery of this courtroom.

Judge:
 I'm gunna call a thirty minute recess to dispose of Mrs. Clark's body.

Joe:
 Peter, you've been quiet.

Peter:
 Yeah, Lois is making me go on a family trip to Old Strubridge Village. I just gotta figure out how to get out of it.

Cleveland:
 Whenever I wanna get out of something, I just use one of my previously earned "Cleveland points". I get six a year, in lieu of birthday gifts, to use as as I see fit.

Quagmire:
 Or why not just pretend to be sick?

Peter:
 You want me to lie? But isn't that a sin?

Cleveland:
 Peter, there is no church to return to. It was destroyed by Jesus in a ball of fire!

Joe:
 Yeah, why aren't we following that story?

Cleveland:
 Because this is a godless show.

Peter:
 Alright, I'll do it. I'll pretend to be sick to get out of going to Old Sturbridge Village.

Peter:
 [checking his thermometer] Mmm, still 126.

Lois:
 Oh, I wish you were feeling well enough to come. Maybe I should stay home and take care of you.

Peter:
 No, go Lois. Go watch dead-eyed pale women make bread.

Lois:
 Okay, sweetie. I hope you get better and if you get bored, there's a fitted sheet in the dryer just waiting to be folded.

Peter:
 Peter, you're a genius. Time to eat a meatball sub and watch football all day. Man, this is an even better scam than Ferris Bueller's Day On.

Boss:
 Okay, I need you to file these and not be working with a shampoo mohawk.

Ferris Bueller:
 You know, life moves pretty fast. If you don't slow down once in a while, you might hit two people in Ireland with your car.

Boss:
 Whatever. Have you finished calculating the insurance adjustments for the Missouri policies?

Ferris Bueller:
 I used to be the cool kid. How did I end up here?

Boss:
 You killed someone.

Peter:
 Aw. Uh-oh. I think I'm stuck.

Meatball:
 Hop in. We're heading to the Jersey Shore.

Peter:
 Hah. They're meatballs.

Lois:
 Here it is, kids. Look around you. It's like Hamilton but with white people.

Chris:
 Well that's not historically accurate.

Sturbridge Lady:
 Welcome to Old Sturbridge Village everyone. Here's a fun fact. In colonial times, butter and soap were the same thing.

Chris:
 I get that it's a fact but how is it fun?

Peter:
 Sheesh, how the hell am I gunna get out of this thing? Lois won't be back for hours.

Peter:
 It's no use. I guess I'm just stuck ... halfway down the stairs.

Peter:
 [singing] Halfway down the stairs is a stair where I sit. There isn't any other stair quite like it. I'm not at the bottom. I'm not at the top. So, this is the stair, where I always stop. Halfway up the stairs isn't up, isn't down. It isn't in the nursery. It isn't in the town. And all sorts of funny thoughts run 'round my head. It isn't really anywhere. It's somewhere else instead. Halfway down the stairs is a stair where I sit. There isn't any other stair quite like it. I'm not at the bottom. I'm not at the top. So, this is the stair, where I always stop.

Chris:
 Oh no! Dad's stuck in a Starcade. He must have danced on the Sabbath.

Stewie:
 Somebody was paying attention today.

Meg:
 Dad, you really can't get out of there? How did this even happen?

Chris:
 Do not speak to the wicked. Throw heads of cabbage at him!

Lois:
 Damm it peter! This all your fault!

Chris:
 I think I know the answer to this question, but there isn't a bathroom in the sixth step of this staircase, is there?

Meg:
 Someone could be vacumming these stairs a little better than they are.

Peter:
 Don't worry guys. I can get us out of here. I'm good at figuring things out. Like when I figured out the secret of business; pointing at stuff during meetings.

Peter:
 Oh yeah. We forgot to do business. We just pointed at stuff.

Meg:
 I'm bored. We've been here three hours.

Lois:
 Let's try playing one-word story. Okay, I'll start. The...

Chris:
 The...

Lois:
 No Chris. Don't repeat what I say. Say a word.

Chris:
 Word.

Lois:
 No, no. Not "word". A word!

Chris:
 A word!

Lois:
 Meg, just.. It's your turn.

Meg:
 The.

Peter:
 God, I'm lost. You guys are so good at this.

Chris:
 Did I win?

Peter:
 Don't worry Lois. I know how to get us out of the stairs. I'll just yell for Quagmire. Quagmire! Quagmire!

Peter:
 Quagmire!

Quagmire:
 Look at that. That's a beautiful cut.

Cleveland:
 I've long dreamed of building a chair with my male friends.

Cleveland:
Yeah I can't believe Peter called us all "mos".

Quagmire:
 (Laughs) All right.

Cleveland:
 Well that was unexpected.

Lois:
 Well I really regret confiscating everyone's phones now. How the hell are we gonna get out of here?

Peter:
 I got no idea, but we're in trouble. Even more than when we were literally in the game, Trouble.

Delivery Man:
 FedAir delivery.

Lois:
 Someone's here!

Chris:
 Oh thank god.

Meg:
 We're gonna get out of this.

Lois:
 Help! Please help us!

Chris:
 There's a fak rock with a key in it.

Delivery Man:
 I don't see it.

Chris:
 Okay there's also a real rock you could throw through the glass.

Delivery Man:
 I found the fake one.

Chris:
 Great.

Meg:
 Oh thank God. Can you get us...

Delivery Man:
 Man, this is gonna be easier than I thought.

Peter:
 Wait, you're robbing us?

Burglar:
 Sure am. And apparently I can take my sweet time.

Burglar:
 Come on in guys.

Peter:
 Oh my god. It's a burglar party!

Delivery Man:
 I got a package for a Brian Griffin.

Burglar:
 I'm Brian Griffin.

Delivery Man:
 Great. Sign here.

Burglar:
 Thanks. Alright you guys who's ready to have some fun?

Peter:
 Hey Brian, they used your account to buy a karoke machine.

Burglar:
 Halfway down the stairs is a stair where I sit.

Peter:
 Oh you're kidding me. They're doing my song!

Burglar:
 There isn't any other stair quite like it. It isn't in the nursery, it isn't in the town, and all sorts of funny thoughts run round my head, it isn't really anywhere, it's somewhere else instead. Halfway down the stairs is a stair where I sit, there isn't any other stair quite like it. I'm not at the bottom, I'm not at the top, so this is the stair where I always stop.

Lois:
 Damn it. They're taking everything!

Peter:
 Crap I haven't felt this violated since I rode that bus in Indida.

Peter:
 Excuse me. These many men are groping me.

Bus Driver:
 I'm "udderly" powerless to stop this. Next stop the holy river, Ganges. Please get your corpses out of the overhead bins and prepare for dumping.

Brian:
 Anyone got any other ideas?

Chris:
 Well Dad got out during the song. Let's just do that.

Peter:
 I don't remember how I did that.

Meg:
 You guys, we gotta do something. And it's fine if the answer is no but does the seventh step have a ladies' room?

Lois:
 Hold on. What if we use the Crabapple phone's virtual assistant, Miri? That way, we could call a carpenter to cut us out of this thing. I looked your phones up but mine is on my purse on the floor.

Brian:
 Worth a shot.

Chris:
 In Soviet Russia, phone calls you.

Lois:
 Chris, knock off Yakov.

Chris:
 Fuck off.

Lois:
 Hey, Miri! Call a carpenter!

Miri:
 Playing The Carpenters.

Lois:
 No! Call a carpenter!

Miri:
 John Carpenter, born January 16th 1948, is an AMerican film director, screenwriter and producer.

Peter:
 Hang on, you proably have to be more specific. Hey Miri, call a woodworker.

Miri:
 Calling Andy Cohen. Just kidding. Calling a woodworker.

Peter:
 I might have taught the phone gay jokes.

Quagmire:
 Spooner Street Rocking Chairs. Guys, the yellow pages work.

Cleveland:
 I can't post this till later. Donna thinks I'm at the doctor.

Joe:
 Well if you put it on Instagram, be sure to tag me. No one's ever tagged me.

Quagmire:
 Wait a second guys. See the marking on this railing? This is an incredibly rare turn-of-the-century staircase. Legally we're not allowed to cut into it because of its tremendous historical value.

Cleveland:
 Smells llike someone's got doo-doo pants.

Joe:
 Oh that's me. Sorry.

Cleveland:
 Is it a trape measure or a tape measurer?

Joe:
 That's not a tape measure-er. You're not measuring the tape. The tape itself is doing the measuring.

Quagmire:
 Woudl you guys shut up? Now I lost count. Gotta start again.

Cleveland:
 Joe, I think you'd best go home and change them pants.

Joe:
 Let's keep it on the banister.

Quagmire:
 I beileve it's called a baluster.

Joe:
 Well if this of historical value, I don't think we're allowed to touch it.

Cleveland:
 Well if we can't cut 'em out of the stairs, what can we do?

Quagmire:
 I suppose there's only one thing.

Woman:
 This type of staircase was very typical of the era. The wood itself is a hardy Rhode Island pine, which was almost completely wiped out by the German aphid, whcih was oddly brought by the Swedes during the Great Depression, which for those of you who are too young, was like a decade -long case of the Mondays.

Man:
 Well, I'm guessing you folks are from out of town too.

Lois:
 Well you guys, I guess we all learned something about not letting technology rule our lives.

Chris:
 And Mom, next time we get baluster slats, let's make sure there's enough room to get our heads out.

Consuela:
 [greets each resident as they enter the mansion] Mr. Peter. Mr. Joe. Mr. Bonnie.

Stewie:
 [to Brian] She doesn't know what "mister" means.

Consuela:
 Mr. Mort. Mr. Muriel. Mayor West Mister.

Stewie:
 Oh, my God, seriously.

West:
 I know what you're all thinking but fear not, citizens. While I'm enjoying myself at this festive get-together, I've left the city in the capable hands of the Mayor-O-Matic 5000.

Matic:
 Take a letter, hold my calls. That's a matter for the Parks Department.

Stewie:
 [after shooting Diane, who almost shot Lois] If anyone's going to take the bitch down, it's gonna be me.

Lois:
 Look, Brian, all I'm saying is it's not normal for people to change their political views so radically overnight.

Brian:
 Lois, no offense, but you don't exactly know what you're talking about. I mean, you...you're not exactly a fountain of political knowledge yourself.

Lois:
 You want to know what I think is happening here?

Brian:
 Oh, this should be rich and overtaxed.

Lois:
 I think you just got to be in the "out" group. Whoever's on top, whoever's in power, whoever's successful, you gotta be on the other side or you don't feel like the smartest guy in the room. All you are, my dear, is a contrarian.

Brian:
 Oh, please, you could not be more off base.

Lois:
 Oh, yeah? Let me ask, what did you think of the movie Titanic?

Brian:
 Horrible. One of the worst movies ever made.

Lois:
 Mm-hm, what about Slumdog Millionaire?

Brian:
 Overrated. Just a terrible movie.

Lois:
 Cocktail.

Brian:
 Actually, not a bad film. You know, as classically structured cinema, Cocktail was one of the best films of its era.

Lois:
 You make me sick, Brian.

Brian:
 Does this mean I'll never see you again?

Rush:
 Oh, I'll be around. Wherever there's a rich white guy in need of another tax break, I'll be there. Wherever there's a brain-dead woman in need of expensive life support her husband doesn't want, I'll be there. Wherever there's a country that needs to be invaded for reasons that don't exactly pan out, I'll be there, too. Oh, yes, I will be around.

Carter:
 Ahh, that was excellent. When I clenched it, you took your fingers away. You were right to do that.

Peter:
 Oh my God! [Carter and his whore gasp in shock] Mr. Pewterschmidt, you're having an affair?! Ewww!

Carter:
 No, no, this is my sister!

Peter:
 Ewww!

Carter:
 No, no, I'm impotent!

Carter:
 I mean, she looked at me while I did it to myself!

Carter:
 I mean, she's a man!

Peter:
 'Ewww!'

Connie:
 [knocks] C'mon, you guys. It's been well over 7 minutes. [knocks again] Let's go! Other people wanna use the closet!

Connie:
 You guys!

Connie:
 Oh... my... God!

Meg:
 Chris?

Meg:
 OH, MY GOD! What are you doing here?!

Chris:
 Tryin' to grab some boob!

Meg:
 FROM YOUR SISTER?!

Chris:
 I didn't know it was you!

Meg:
 Well, who did you think it was?!

Chris:
 Some bitch! Who cares?!

Meg:
 [coughs] OH, MY GOD! Oh! WE DID SO MUCH!

Chris:
 SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP!

Meg:
 WE'RE DISGUSTING! WE'RE A DISGRACE TO OUR FAMILY!

Man dressed as Clinton:
 [in his underpants] Ah! Maybe I can get in on this!

Peter:
 UGLY BITCHES!

Quagmire:
 MOOOOOOO!

Tom:
 Now, since this is a televised boxing match, I'm going to be joined by a horribly disfigured former fighter providing barely intelligible commentary throughout. Any thoughts on the fight, Floyd?

Wetherton:
 Ah, I think that they are, they are gonna have, they are gonna be fightin' Diedre's last fight in the contrast to the later one is gonna be b-better than usually.

Tom:
 And how do you think that helps her chances tonight?

Wetherton:
 Well, the match lasts about up until the particular inaccuracy, p-particular unusually that should be the ultimate determining factor in about the 12-round experience, the heart of a champion, margarine hat.

Tom:
 Well, we'll be watching for that. We'll be checking in with you throughout the night, Floyd, and happy 23rd birthday.

Wetherton:
 You're welcome.

Stewie:
 Brian, settle down. You're worse than that guy from Penguin Publishing.

Penguin:
 You wanna get a book published, don't you?

Writer:
 Well, yes.

Penguin:
 Well, if you wanna be in black and white, black and white's gotta be in you.

Huffington:
 I think that this is simple exploitation of the American people who would be using the money that they spend to buy this book to actually buy something useful like legitimate health care that they actually need.

Brian:
 You know, what the hell's your problem, Zsa Zsa?

Huffington:
 What is your problem, Snoopy?

Brian:
 Glenn? Glenn Quagmire? Wow! What are you doin' here?

Quagmire:
 [not surprised] Oh, hi, Brian. Just waitin' for Santa, like everyone else.

Brian:
 Cool, cool. We'll just hang with you guys. [approaches Quagmire's niece] Hey, who's this little guy? Is this your nephew? Hey, buddy! Are you excited to see Santa? Hope you've been a good boy this year.

Quagmire:
 That "little guy" is my niece Abby, you douche. Her hair's short because of the chemotherapy.

Stewie:
 Uh-oh.

Quagmire:
 Do you know how much talking it took to get her outta the house because of her no-hair?

Brian:
 Gosh, I didn't know. I'm so sorry.

Quagmire:
 Oh, you're sorry? For what? That waiting in line is such a catastrophe for you'd rather destroy the confidence of a 5-year-old cancer patient?

Brian:
 Aw, c'mon. I didn't know she was dying.

Quagmire:
 Who said anything about dying?

Abby:
 Uncle Glenn, am I dying?

Quagmire:
 [holds her close] No, sweetheart, you're not dying, 'cause we're gonna see Santa, and he's gonna give you a new brain. [turns to Brian, unhappily grinding his teeth] Get outta here, Brian. Just get out of here.

Stewie:
 Should've gone into politics, Bri.

Dan:
 Hey, who the hell are you?

Brian:
 Uh... Hello.

Dan:
 What are you doing in my house?

Stewie:
 We're Santa Claus... es.

Dan:
 Yeah, you're Santa Claus, that's why you broke in through the window, I'm calling the cops!

Brian:
 No, no no no, I-I can explain. We came down the chimney, but we forgot the presents. It's actually-, it's kind of a funny story. [Stewie beats Dan with a baseball bat knocking him unconscious] What the hell did you do?!

Stewie:
 He was gonna call the cops, man. You can't call the cops on Santa.

Stewie:
 Alright, that's the last of the blood, go check on the other kid.

Brian:
 What other kid?

Stewie:
 Johnny, the one who's getting the bat.

Brian:
 [runs upstairs] Stewie there's only one bedroom up here.

Stewie:
 What? Do you have a brother?

Stewie:
 Well then, who the hell is Joh...? Oh my God, we're in the wrong house.

Ron:
 The next morning, Stewie and Brian set out on foot for the North Pole. They were cold and tired, but Stewie was determined to carry out his plan to kill Santa Claus. As long as I've got all of you people-watching, does anyone wanna buy some pot?

Drew:
 Everybody, welcome back to The Price is Right. Time to spin the wheel. The top winner for the day is Peter, so you're gonna be the first to spin it. Go ahead, Peter. Close as you can to a dollar without going over.

Drew:
 Alright. While we're waitin' for the wheel to spin, wanna say hi to anybody?

Peter:
 Oh, yeah, Drew! I wanna say hi to Lois, Brian, Chris, Stewie, Meg, Joe, Bonnie, Quagmire, Cleveland, Mort, Seamus, Adam West, Dr. Hartman, Bruce, Carter, Babs, Tom Tucker, Angela, Opie, Carl, Herbert, Jillian, Consuela, Giant Chicken, Greased-Up Deaf Guy!

Drew:
 [laughs] Okay. Sure they're happy to hear that.

Peter:
 Whoa! Paramedics, come on down!

Bonnie:
 [after hearing the news about Lois] Ha! Slut!

Brian:
 Ah, good. It's starting.

Peter:
 Yeah, that's what YOU say. I can never figure out when the hell the studio logos end and the actual movie begins. [20th Century Fox logo plays] Alright. Let's see what you got, Fox. [map pops out from under the water on the screen] Oh, I bet that's a sea monster. [revealed to be logo for Underwater Map Productions] Oh, that's not the movie. That's... yeah, I think I've heard of them. [Once Upon a Time... shows up on screen] Here we go. Movie! ["STUDIOS" shows up from under the caption] Well, now that seems intentionally misleading. [airplane comes up on screen] Alright, someone's coming to town! [revealed to be logo for Arriving Flight Productions] Oh, for crying out loud! [image of India shown with the caption "India, 1853"] Alright, a period movie. [zooms out to show that it's the logo for Country-and-Date Productions] Oh, not a period movie. [guy on screen runs into a house in a thunderstorm] Oh, this guy's in trouble. Can't wait to hear his story. [flashes and tints into black and white on-screen to show that it's the logo for Panting Man's Wounded Shoulder Films] Oh, COME ON!

Tom:
 This man wants to testify!

Peter:
 Very well, my brother. Let us lead him on the path of righteousness!

Tom:
 This poor gentleman used to speak in long, eloquent sentences. But after years of drinking, he can only speak in short, choppy utterances. Why, at one time, if you asked him who his favorite musicians were, he'd say, "Leonard Bernstein, Johann Sebastian Bach, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart". But thanks to that old devil hooch, it's all changed. Who's your favorite musician, Ollie?

Ollie:
 CHER!

Tom:
 He doesn't even like Cher!

Herbert:
 [After Franz has been killed by his fall] Say good night, you Nazi bastard...

Meg:
 Mr. Swanson, can I ask you a personal question? What is it like having a disability?

Joe:
 Well, it isn't easy. But it's like we handicapped say: "When life gives you lemons, make leg-o-nade.

Meg:
 I guess I can relate to that. I mean, sometimes it's really hard being me, so when life gives me lemons, I guess I just make Meg-o-nade.

Joe:
 That sounds disgusting.

Peter:
 I think we should go live with Mom...

Stewie:
 I just heard all of that, and I just want to say this family is fucking disintegrating.

Brian:
 Hey, you okay?

Quagmire:
 Yup. Just waiting for my car.

Brian:
 Look, I'm sorry I did what I did. Cheryl's great and I hope someday you get the chance to be with her.

Quagmire:
 No. I'm never gonna get that chance again. I blew it for good, Brian, and you know what? I deserve to be lonely. I'm no saint, I dated Jillian just to hurt you.

Brian:
 It's okay. It probably wouldn't have worked out like everything else. Hey, you know, maybe it took us stealing each other's girls to finally become friends.

Quagmire:
 [admittedly] Yeah, maybe.

Brian:
 Boy, Carol's lucky to have a sister like Lois.

Peter:
 You're tellin' me. I always wanted a brother or sister, but instead, I got a broster.

Broster:
 Hey, Peter, you wanna see my vegenis?

Peter:
 Uh... Uh-- I-- Uh, I-I don't know.

West:
 Oh, by the way, I should tell you I got aides.

Carol:
 What?

West:
 Yeah, they're right over there waiting for me. [points to West's aides]

Aide:
 Ready to go when you are, sir.

West:
 Poor guys. They both have AIDS.

Loggia:
 NOT OKAY!

Brian:
 Aw, don't feel bad, Peter. Hey, I know what'll cheer ya up. [leaves] Hey, where the hell's my banana thing?

Stewie:
 [appears behind the couch in Brian's banana suit and sings and dances] It's Peanut Butter Jelly Time!

Peter:
 [laughs] Oh, my God! Oh, Stewie! That is so funny! I did not see that comin'! [leaves]

Brian:
 But that was my thing.

Stewie:
 I'm pretty sure it was the Internet's thing.

Peter:
 Now, I know some teachers think they're workin' outside the box when they have class on the lawn, but I'm gonna take it a step further. We're gonna do peyote in the desert.

Meg:
 [dancing] Oh, it's beautiful! Everything is so beautiful! Come dance with me, Dad!

Peter:
 Soon, Meg. Soon. But first, I must inhale. [inhales] And again. [inhales] And again. [inhales, pause] Let's go to the Hollywood Hills and kill a bunch of people.

Vader:
 Oh, my God. That was absolute hell! I don't understand why we're in a galaxy far away, and we still have to change in Atlanta.

Moff:
 Hi, Darth. You got any bags, or did you leave Mrs. Vader at home?

Vader:
 Wow, it's you? Are we already out of our characters?

Tiaan:
 What?

Vader:
 How's the construction going?

Tiaan:
 Oh, fantabulously. Remember how last time they skimmed along a trench and then blew it up by shooting through a hole?

Vader:
 Yeah.

Tiaan:
 Well, now there's no trench.

Vader:
 Great. Is there a hole?

Tiaan:
 [pause] Yes.

Vader:
 What?

Tiaan:
 There is.

Vader:
 Well, if I were you, I'd repair that hole before the Emperor arrives.

Tiaan:
 The Emperor is coming here?

Vader:
 Yeah, he loves this place. I was there when he came up with the idea for the Death Star.

Peter:
 Shirts off! I want to see who's got bigger pecs. [Tears off his shirt]

Peter:
 Well, they look better when they're oiled up. Chris, pass that salad dressing. Oh, no, it's an almost empty squeeze bottle. Hang on. [squirts whatever is left onto his body] Eh, it's all out. [to Chris] There's dressing on that salad! Gimme that salad! [puts some salad onto his body] Yeah, who's the better man now, Ross?!

Quagmire:
 Thanks to you, TV's a vast wasteland. Do you know how I know that phrase? I read it in a book, you monster!

Brian:
 Hey, what's wrong, Peter?

Peter:
 I miss my friend, Brian. I mean, I was having fun with those Nielsen boxes, but what's the point if I don't get Joe and Quagmire to enjoy it with me? I guess I shouldn't have messed with television.

Brian:
 Well, it's not exactly your fault. The networks never should have listened to you in the first place. This is exactly what makes bad television: pandering to the lowest common denominator.

Peter:
 So what do I do, Brian?

Brian:
 Well, you still have these boxes. That means you still have the power to influence television. Maybe you can use that power to help restore television to the way it was.

Peter:
 You're right, Brian. Maybe if I watch smart, quality shows, that'll help get things back to the way they were. We can use these boxes for good and...

Peter:
 What the hell?!

Mayor West:
 That's for adding another tree to One Tree Hill!

Brian:
 Oh, my God! He destroyed every last box!

Brian:
 We're sunk now, Peter. There goes your one chance to get television back to the way it was.

Peter:
 Wait a minute. Maybe not, Brian.

Peter:
 I think I just got an idea.

Peter:
 Aah! I got glass in my face! Oh, crap. Now I forgot what it was.

Peter:
 Aah! Son of a bitch!

Peter:
 I learned how to somersault. [Peter tries to do it, but falls over] Did I do it?

Peter:
 I guess all the time Quagmire should've been saying "Wiggity".

Quagmire:
 Baldness is for women's crotches, not men's heads.

Stewie:
 I don't think so. The crotch doesn't look like a BMX track. You bastard! You've been using my time machine to nail your bar skanks!

Brian:
 Oh, come on! They're not all bad.

Stewie:
 Oh, yes. I've seen the women you bring home. That stutterer, she was a real prize.

Lois:
 How are you enjoying your meal?

Woman:
 L-L-L-L-L-Lois, it's d-d-d-delicious.

Peter:
 Oh, for crying out loud. [walks up to the thermostat and turns up the heat]

Lois:
 Peter, why are you turning up the heat again?

Peter:
 Lois, this woman is freezing.

Stewie:
 Somehow, my machine seems to have reversed the direction of time.

Brian:
 Reversed the direction of time? Stewie, what does that mean? I don't get it.

Brian:
 Okay, now I get it.

Cleveland:
 Man, we got a large number of clovers on our lawn. [He floats up while the damage to both the house and the bathtub undo themselves] No, no, no, no, no, NO!

Peter:
 Oh, hey, Cleveland.

Peter:
 Australia, here I come!

Stewie:
 What the hell was that?

Brian:
 This is more intense than that time I fought a rabbit in that karate tournament.

Stewie:
 That's weird. You're doing reverse cutaways now?

Stewie:
 What the devil is that?

Brian:
 It's Peter and Chris. Sounds like they're in trouble.

Stewie:
 My God. Why is there so much vomit everywhere?

Brian:
 [points at a bottle] Is that the ipecac bottle? [suddenly realizes] Oh, no! No, please, not this!

Stewie:
 Oh, God! It's not gonna be coming out of us, it's gonna be going - [throws up]

Brian:
 Oh, dear God! [throws up] Aah! WHAT THE HELL?!

Stewie:
 I don't wanna! I don't wanna! [regurgitates]

Chris:
 Dad, I'm scared! [vomits and cries]

Stewie:
 Oh God, this is so disgusting! I think I'm gonna puke! [regurgitates] FUCK!

Brian:
 Stewie, I don't care what it takes. We've GOT to fix this! We just ate so much vomit!

Stewie:
 Brian, it gets worse. Look.

Brian:
 Yeah, Bonnie is pregnant with Susie. So what?

Stewie:
 That means Susie has been "unborn".

Brian:
 Oh, my God! Stewie, you aren't that much older than Susie.

Stewie:
 Brian, if we don't push time forward again soon, then I too will become unborn.

Chris:
 You guys heard the baby talking in there, didn't you?

Lois:
 Chris, that's ridiculous!

Stewie:
 Watch your back, Simpsons, we're less than halfway there.

Joe:
 What is that?

Peter:
 Let's use our eyes to see.

Brian:
 Stupid cat!

Stewie:
 Oh, my God! Super Mario? What are you doing here?

Mario:
 I jump-a on-a turtles, Stewie. It's-a not an exciting life, but it's-a my life.

Peter:
 I'm gonna get our old mom back! Brian, keys! Chris, beer! Meg, UG-LAAAAAY!

Jester:
 I'm King Stewie! I rule with an iron fist! La-la-la-la-la-la-la, look at me! Oooh!

Stewie:
 In my office. Now.

Quagmire:
 How're you girls doin' on popcorn?

Girl:
 I'll take some.

Quagmire:
 Here ya go. [tilts popcorn container towards a girl with his crotch.]

Lois:
 Meg, Kent's here!

Meg:
 Just putting on my lipstick! [shaves, cuts] Damn it!

Stewie:
 Rupert, did you hear that? Meg's boyfriend is in love with me. Not that I care, I mean, it won't matter once I explain to him what's going on with us. But what would I tell him is going on with us?

Stewie:
 Dear God, I have a shoeing appointment in the morning and I want to be fresh!

 Hartman:
 Yeah, that's... that's not supposed to be there so, she should probably always wear a hat.

Lois:
 Oh, I wouldn't worry about it, Bonnie. I've put Stewie in the oven a bunch of times. As long as you come to your senses in 15 minutes, everything's fine.

Peter:
 Lois, can I go slip N slide in the yard?

Lois:
 Has it been half an hour since you've eaten?

Peter:
 Yes, almost.

Lois:
 Okay, I just wanna be sure you don't get a cramp.

Peter:
 Yay, poor people water fun!

Consuela:
 No, no, no.

Peter:
 Hey, what's that in there?

Guide:
 That's a sensory deprivation room that prepares our astronauts for the terrifying emptiness of space.

Peter:
 Aw cool! Hey, c'mon, Brian. Try it with me. [both enter. The guide closes the door; both scream and exit with heads in each other's bodies]

Peter:
 Things got crazy so fast!

Peter:
 We were talking about Meg. We call her Chris so she doesn't know.

Meg:
 Screw you!

Peter:
 Shut up, Chris!

Peter:
 A week ago, we call him stupid and now he's given tours at a space shuttle. Negative reinforcement, that's the key. [kicks Stewie] Right, stupid?

Stewie:
 Ow! I'll do better!

Lois:
 Everyone, strap yourselves in! Stewie, hold my hand!

Stewie:
 No, thank you. I prefer to die giving you the finger. [Stewie does so]

Peter:
 If this is what it takes to get out of Florida, fine.

Meg:
 [touring the shuttle with Chris] So do you know how all this stuff works?

Chris:
 Well, I don't know what most of these buttons do, but I know this big red one is the one you press to launch.

Stewie:
 Ooo! Big red button!

Brian:
 [as they are being blasted off] You know what? You only live once. I am sticking my head out the window. [he does] YES! THIS IS THE BEST PART OF WHATEVER'S SO ENJOYABLE ABOUT THIS!

Brian:
 What are you doing?

Chris:
 Saving our lives.

Peter:
 I wish he hadn't said that. Now I'm kinda rooting against him.

Stewie:
 What the deuce are you talking about? The play I wrote, have you seen it?

Stewie:
 You tried to destroy it, didn't you? I knew my play was good, just like I knew your play was a mediocre patchwork of hackneyed ideas and tired cliches. You have no idea how hard it was to sit in that theater with all those braying hyenas. Couldn't you tell something was up when Chris and the fat man could follow the plot? I mean, it took Peter a year to figure out "Stuart Little".

Peter:
 I just figured it out. "Stuart" means mouse.

Lois:
 No, Peter.

Peter:
 "Little" means mouse?

Peter:
 I feel so old and in the way.

Brian:
 It's still a good play!

Stewie:
 It's filled with terrible double entendres, puns, and stolen bits. There's a line in there from "Seinfeld".

Brian:
 I never saw that episode.

Stewie:
 I have a voice. Do you understand that? A writer needs a voice and I have one. You don't. Your play panders to the lowest common denominator, Brian. And it doesn't even do that well!

Peter:
 Where will you two be going on your date? And can I plan your bridal golden shower?

Peter:
 Your new wife is a human toilet.

Lois:
 Welcome to our home, Charisse. Sit on my lips if you like. That chair with the garbage bag taped over it looks pretty good.

Stewie:
 Meg, you look good next to her.

Quagmire:
 I need you to have sex with me while she watches.

Peter:
 I have some demands.

Quagmire:
 What the hell is going on with my life?

Lois:
 Peter, are you ready for your Valentine's gift?

Stewie:
 No, but I'm ready for therapy.:

Brian:
 Oh my God. Stewie, what happened?

Stewie:
 NONE OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS WHAT HAPPENED!

Brian:
 (angrily) Geez, do you kiss your mother with that mouth? (Stewie throws up again while Brian recoils)

s date:
 I thought we could get some breakfast.

Quagmire:
 Clearly, you're not familiar with how this works.

Herbert:
 Sweet dreams, Chris.

Chris:
 I'm not tired yet.

Lois:
 That was a fun birthday party, huh, Stewie?

Stewie:
 That kid was Indian and eleven years old. Where are you finding my friends?

Lois:
 It's like our privates were shaking hands after a successful business meeting in a swamp.

Stewie:
 Can I interest you guys in a two-and-a-quarter way?

Joe:
 Hey, Quagmire, do yourself a favor: don't get married.

Quagmire:
 I wasn't gonna.

Joe:
 Good. Don't.

Quagmire:
 [Impatiently] I said I wasn't!

Quagmire:
 Joe, you telling me not to does not affect me whatsoever. I will not get married.

Joe:
 [Defiantly] Perfect. ...don't.

Joe:
 Quagmire, you should never meet one of those sex operators.

Quagmire:
 [Impatiently] Yeah that's what I said... I wouldn't do it!

Quagmire:
 [Angrily] J-Joe, you realize what you're telling me not to do, I already am not doing! I know I should never meet one of those sex operators ever!

Peter:
 Thanks for the lift, Gil. I think I'll take the express down.

Peter:
 Is dinner almost ready?

Lois:
 Yes, Peter. God, where are you? I can barely hear you.

Peter:
 Pull back my chair ever so slightly.

Peter:
 Ahh, Daddy's home.

Peter:
 I just don't think he could have done it. Guilty!

Peter:
 Oh, guilty is the other one? [exasperated] Well, I don't know.

Lois:
 Peter, how long do we have to sit here?

Peter:
 Until I'm not angry anymore, you naked bitches!

Judge:
 We will now hear the defense attorney's closing statement.

Peter:
 I switched seats.

Peter:
 Enough!... was a movie with Jennifer Lopez that did not live up to expectations.

Quagmire:
 And now to take my position. This is what I call the butterfat.

Stewie:
 There's a maniac out there! He's cutting people's power off, breaking into their homes, and slitting their throats! [the lights suddenly go out] ...And we're dead.

Peter:
 What kind of dog is that?

Roger:
 [indicates Meg] I was gonna ask you the same thing.

Peter:
 Lift the shades, there's a man on the wing! [Joe lifts the shades] I'm the man on the wing.

Joe:
 Are you crazy?!

Quagmire:
 I don't know if I can pull out of this! Giggity!

Stewie:
 [weakly] You... look... fat.

Peter:
 [sighs] I'm bored.

Quagmire:
 Peter, you made me crash the damn plane!

Peter:
 Okay, I know you're a pilot and everything, but not everyone likes to talk about planes as much as you, Quagmire.

Peter:
 [in a deep voice] I even won a deep voice contest with Joe.

Joe:
 [in a deep voice] I heard you coming.

Peter:
 I made myself heard.

Joe:
 Where have you come from?

Peter:
 I've come from where I've been.

Joe:
 You still riding with that mangy polecat, Fletcher?

Peter:
 Fletcher met the long arm of the law at the wrong end of a shotgun in the deep end of a grave at the far end of a dead-end road.

Referee:
 Winner!

Peter:
 Look, Lois! I have my friends and you have groceries and all those rusty pink razors in the shower. Now just stick to what's intended for you and leave my things to me.

Lois:
 Hey, Horace, get that wiener outta your hand and give us 3 more beers over here.

Horace:
 Ah, Lois, you're always giving me the business.

Peter:
 Hey, Horace, why don't ya take that wiener outta your hand and give me a beer!

Horace:
 Don't talk to me that way, you son of a bitch! [Punches Peter]

Chris:
 Hey, Meg. Who's your date? He looks like a real stiff.

Peter:
 There's only one drinking spot for us and it's the Clam.

Quagmire:
 But Peter, it's closed. We can't go in there.

Peter:
 Quagmire, when a girl says she doesn't want to have sex with you, do you take that as an answer?

Quagmire:
 My lawyer has advised me not to answer that question.

Meg:
 [puts make up on corpse] Wow, that really works. Hmm, maybe I'll try that on myself.

s boss at the morgue:
 Oh, eh... You have what we call a "closed-casket-face".

Lois:
 [to Peter] I forgot you don't even know your ass from a hole in the ground.

Peter:
 Is that my ass?

Meg:
 You guys. I think this is a meth lab.

Lois:
 Oh my god. Do you mean like as in D-R-U-G-S? Aren't those I-L-L-E-G-A-L?

Stewie:
 What's going on? What are you guys talking about?

Lois:
 Uh-oh, someone's getting cranky. [picks up Stewie] I think he needs an N-A-P.

Stewie:
 What's happening? Where are you taking me? Man, I got to crack this code.

Peter:
 Scissors are jerks! And I'm a owl.

Lucky Stewie:
 Okay, come on. You look nothing like your photo in the ad.

Loan Shark Enforcer:
 [pulls out a gun] Shut up and give me the money!

Lucky Brian:
 What?! What the hell are you talking about?

Lucky Stewie:
 Okay, I'm starting to think you're not Apollo.

Loan Shark Enforcer:
 You bastards think that you can just borrow a bunch of money from a loan shark and then waste it on tacky suits?!

Lucky Stewie:
 "Tacky"? Sir, I'll have you know I bought this in the lobby of a casino!

Lucky Brian:
 Don't shoot! You must have us confused with someone else. We didn't borrow any money, I swear!

Loan Shark Enforcer:
 Sounds like someone wants to die!

Lucky Brian:
 No! Stewie, just give him the money from the backpack!

Lucky Stewie:
 Okay, okay! Don't shoot! [unzips the unlucky pair's backpack] What? It's empty! It's just Cheerios and coloring books!

Lucky Brian:
 What?! Where the hell is the money?!

Lucky Stewie:
 Sir, we can't give you any money, but if you have some milk and a bowl, we can give you a healthy way to start your day.

Loan Shark Enforcer:
 Alright, enough of this! You, dog - pick which one of you two is gonna die!

Lucky Brian:
 What?! You can't ask me to decide something like that! The life of every being is sacred, just like the life of -

Loan Shark Enforcer:
 Fine! I'll kill you!

Lucky Brian:
 No, no! [points at Stewie] Kill him! He's a baby! He won't even remember he was alive!

Lucky Stewie:
 You son of a -

Lucky Brian:
 Aaah! Stewie!

Loan Shark Enforcer:
 Now give us the money borrowed!

Stewie:
 Well... this is it.

Stewie:
 Count to three?

Brian:
 Yep.

Brian and Stewie:
 1... 2...

Brian:
 [jumps off the balcony, but Stewie doesn't] Three!

Stewie:
 [holds onto the railing] I'm sorry, I can't! I want to live! I didn't think we were gonna do it!

Brian:
 [falls to his death] YOU DICK!

Stewie:
 Oh, my God! Brian! Brian, no! Good Lord, what have I done?! [tries to run out of the room] I'd better get the hell out of here! [trips over his backpack and finds the money the other pair had won] What the deuce? Where did this come from? [slides the money tops] Well, looks like Archibald Meatpants is gonna have a fun night.

Brian:
 Hey, so yeah... I'm digging a hole under the fence in the backyard.

Stewie:
 Brian, you have a car. You don't have to escape.

Brian:
 Just don't say anything, okay?

Peter:
 [to Lois] I want you on my team for everything... except for sports.

Stewie:
 Ah! Friendly fire!

Quagmire:
 We're supposed to dig this kid up. Any volunteers?

Herbert:
 [in mining gear] I dig kids.

Chris:
 Why are your nipples poking into me?!

Meg:
 Sorry! That happens when I'm cold.

Chris:
 But why are there 3 of them?!

Meg:
 There aren't! Two of them are moles.

Chris:
 Those numbers still don't add up!

Lois:
 Oh, look who's back; the grave robber.

Peter:
 Hey, Lois.

Lois:
 So, what happened? Did you find your treasure?

Peter:
 No, I realized something after you left; It's not the treasure that matters. All that matters is the money you get in exchange for the treasure. I guess I had to learn that the hard way.

Chip:
 Her voice! It's like God sneezing!

Peter:
 [glumly] Welp, now we know. I can taste what he eats.

Teacher at a PTA meeting:
 So, in short; your kids are all doing great. Keep reading to them every night and I think we're going to have a great year. So, unless there are any questions, thank you all for coming.

Cheetah:
 Eh, yeah... I noticed the hot lunch menu doesn't feature any gazelle.

Teacher:
 I'll bring that up to the board.

Cheetah:
 Yeah, see... I-I heard that last year and [laughing] he-h-here we are again.

Quagmire:
 Remind me again. Chip is that African kid you adopted?

Peter:
 No that's Chocolate Chip. We gave him back to Kenya.

Sonja:
 Oh, I'm gonna clean out your trunk. Giggity.

Quagmire:
 That's my word! That's my word!

Joe:
 Quagmire, are you in there?!

Peter:
 Oh, he's eating. [shouts at the door] We'll come back when you're done eating!

Ida:
 Okay, you guys. Where should we start looking for Glenn?

Peter:
 Well, sometimes Quagmire likes to hang out under all the clutter in my garage, so why don't we start sorting stuff and throwing stuff away, but check with me before you throw stuff away?

Meg:
 He's gonna kill me! I can already picture my funeral!

Peter:
 Thanks, didn't wanna pay for the hole.

Meg:
 Chris, you have my back, right?

Chris:
 I don't know. [lifts his shirt and sees his back covered with bacne] Yeah.

Mailman:
 [after Brian opens the door] Brian Griffin?

Brian:
 Uh, yeah, that's me.

Mailman:
 [gives the package to Brian] Here you go.

Brian:
 [sees something terrible in the package, it's revealed to be Peter's penis he cut off] Aah! Oh, God!

Peter:
 [laughs] What's in the box, Brian? I got you good! [Blood is coming out and comes to Peter's pants] I don't feel right. I want it back. [Collapses]

Brian:
 You gonna put your clothes on?

Peter:
 Yes, I swear.

Brian:
 You gonna keep them on?

Peter:
 Yes, I promise I'll never bother you again. Just please make this stop!

Brian:
 Good.

Chris:
 Dad, can you give me a ride to the-- [screams] What is that thing?! Make it go away! [claws his eyes out]

Lois:
 What's going on in here? [sees that Brian has shaved off all his fur] Oh, my God! Is that a rat?! Peter, hold it down! I'm getting a gun!

Man:
 You renounced your citizenship?

Peter:
 Oh, I did that on the Italian "Shut-up-a-You-Facebook."

Lois:
 Last night was the best sex I ever had.

Peter:
 Me too. We haven't done it like that since we were engaged, but allowed to sleep with other people.

Peter:
 Kids, I've got an announcement...

Stewie:
 [sitting near the hem of Peter's robe on the floor] He's wearing a rubber.

Peter:
 We're staying in Italy. We're Italian now.

Brian:
 What?!

Meg:
 Are you kidding?

Stewie:
 Well, if we're going to be Italian, I guess we should start murdering our brothers.

Chris:
 What are you... [starts to choke and struggle]

Stewie:
 [in an Italian-accented whisper] You break-a my heart, Chris. You break-a my heart.

Stewie:
 There. Now I said it. So shut your mouth.

Stewie:
 [sees a car heading towards Brian] Brian, look out! [the car runs over Brian, breaking the hockey stick, and the toy net in the process] Aah, Brian! [runs to him]

Lois:
 [runs out of the house with Peter, Chris, and Meg and saw Brian hurt] Oh, my God! [runs to him] Brian! Brian, can you hear me?!

Peter:
 Holy crap! What the hell happened?!

Squirrel:
 [runs to Brian, kicks his head, and spits] That guy sucked! [runs away]

Peter:
 Aren't you supposed to be running around?

Chicken:
 Don't talk to me. You have a bad reputation in the chicken community.

Brian:
 Damn it, Stewie! What the hell did you do?!

Stewie:
 I know, I know, I messed up.

Brian:
 [Mocks] "I messed up!" [Normal voice] You went back to 17th-century Jamestown and you gave guns to the Indians. And now they're running everything!

Stewie:
 I said I messed up, all right?! I guess I just have this pathological need to be liked.

Brian:
 Well, it's not a good trait.

Stewie:
 Oh, come on. Don't say that. Let me buy you lunch.

Brian:
 Thanks to you, the Indians killed all the white people and took over America! I mean, you're the one who's always saying "never alter the past".

Stewie:
 Oh, come on, Brian, let's be honest. I frequently alter the past.

Jesus:
 All right, so, I guess we'll split the bill 13 ways?

Stewie:
 Hey, Judas, he ordered like 5 margaritas. All you had was a salad.

Quagmire:
 [meditating] I can be Giggity. I can be Goo.

Stewie:
 Meg, could you zip up your fly? That's kind of wafting over here.

Chris:
 So did you get a lot of trim on the road?

Peter:
 [nodding] Chris, that's wildly inappropriate.

Peter:
 Quagmire? I thought you were still out on the road!

Quagmire:
 I was, but what was Simon without Garfunkel?

Peter:
 Wildly successful?

TV Announcer:
 We now return to Muppet Babies.

Kermit:
 Piggy, I don't think Kermie Jr. is feeling well.

Lois:
 It's Stewie's first Christmas!

Stewie:
 Again?

Vinny:
 Whose leg do you gotta gagoosh to get an Amaretto around here?

Vinny:
 Georgette, I'm coming home.

Stewie:
 Who the hell is Georgette?

Stewie:
 [comes from the future and sees Brian on the street. He sees the car heading right for him and runs to him] Brian, look out! [pushes him out of the way, letting the hockey stick and toy net get broken by the car]

Brian:
 What the hell?

Stewie:
 You're alive, my friend! [hugs him]

Brian:
 What? Of course, I'm alive. What the hell is going on here?

Stewie:
 Brian, [points at the car] that car killed you, and when it did, a little part of me died as well. I couldn't live without you, so I came back from the future to save your life.

Brian:
 Wait a minute. What are you talking about? I saw you destroy your time machine.

Stewie:
 Yes, but luckily, I ran into another me from the past, so I stole his return pad and came back here. Oh, that reminds me. I better send this back to where it came from.

Brian:
 Wow, Stewie, thank you for saving my life! Y'know, a whole lot of other families would've just gotten another dog and moved on.

Stewie:
 Oh, oh, w...we could, we could never do something like that, Brian! [starts to fade away]

Brian:
 Stewie, wh-what's happening to you?

Stewie:
 [looks at himself] I think...my timeline has been erased! The timeline where you died no longer exists! Merry Christmas, Brian. [finally fades away]

Stewie:
 Hey, who are you talking to out here?

Brian:
 A pretty awesome guy.

Brian:
 Thanks for everything, Stewie. You're my best friend, and I love you.

Stewie:
 All I can say, Brian, is you've been making creepy eye contact with me all morning, and I want it to stop right now.

Stewie:
 You know you've made it when you've got a teenage boss.

Peter:
 My hog cannot partake in the slop this evening.

Lois:
 Oh, Peter, you're up.

Stewie:
 That's not what I heard.

Lois:
 This shouldn't embarrass you, the size should embarrass you.

Peter:
 Jack and the Beanstalk. And that title could be a fairy tale or porn. Let's find out.

Quagmire:
 Where the hell did that thing come from? It's blocking my view of Little Miss Muffet's tuffet.

Quagmire:
 Damn beanstalk. Hey, Little Boy Brown! You said that you were gonna help me saw!

Cleveland:
 I can't find any gloves!

Stewie:
 You know, I'm not sure if that's our hero, or just a lunatic going house-to-house murdering people.

Jaden:
 he kinda looks like Jason.

Quagmire:
 [to Peter] You can't even walk and chew gum at the same time!

Lois:
 Come on!

Peter:
 I'm doin' somethin'. [chews] One thing at a time!

Quagmire:
 DAMN IT, PETER, THAT'S IT! I AM DONE! I AM DONE WITH YOU! I AM DONE WITH ALL YOUR CRAP, I NEVER WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN! THIS FRIENDSHIP IS OVER! [leaves]

Peter:
 Well, fine! I don't need your friendship anyway!

Peter:
 Now this is a gun without safety.

Peter:
 Quite the difference, huh?

Quagmire:
 DAMN IT, PETER, YOU SON OF A BITCH, YOU SHOT ME!

Joe:
 Oh, my God! Peter, that must be the dumbest thing you've ever done!

Peter:
 No. The dumbest I ever did was open that can of whup-ass.

Peter:
 Lois, why did you buy this?!

Lois:
 It was on sale.

Jackson:
 Yamn it to hell!ou just that

Jeffrey:
 It was a long time before you and me, yo.

Peter:
 All right, Quagmire, I have given this a lot of thought. I need you to shoot me in the arm and we can be friends again.

Peter:
 [after realizing what he just told Quagmire] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! No, no, I was supposed to offer, and then you were supposed to say, "No, Peter, I'm not gonna shoot you, although I do appreciate the gesture."

Peter:
 I, erm...I passed the test?

Quagmire:
 No, Peter. I'm gonna shoot you like a dirty animal.

Peter:
 But, but just the fact that I would make the offer is so meaningful to you

Quagmire:
 Your offer means nothing, Peter. But the only thing that it means anything to me is a bullet in your arm. Now give me that!

Peter:
 Stop! Stop! Quagmire, let go!

Quagmire:
 Come on! You're not leaving here without being shot!

Peter:
 Look, I was trying to do the decent thing, like you'd see in a movie!

Quagmire:
 I'm putting that bullet in your arm, Peter!

Peter:
 Ah! Son of a bitch!

Joe:
 It's over. We're all friends again.

Peter:
 What the hell, Joe?!

Joe:
 I'm just trying to settle this nonsense.

Quagmire:
 Nothing got settled!

Jackson:
 Damn it to hell!

Angela:
 So as you can see, our output is up 1 1/2%. That's not net, I'm talking gross.

Peter:
 [under his breath] You do everything gross.

Quagmire:
 C'mon, guys! It's game time!

Peter:
 Alright! This is the greatest Sunday tradition ever...except for getting all my cutaway gags ready for the week. [cutaway] Okay, my great uncle wears a ski hat all the time Griffin will be followed by Nick Nolte's handkerchief, followed by Japanese Abe Lincoln, and then Monkey Rabbi. Hey, where's the Monkey Rabbi? Here's your Torah, you'll be here on Tuesday at 9:00. Check in with Shirley.

Darth Vader:
 You gonna need me this week?

Peter:
 Uh, maybe. Maybe Friday. Uh, now where are the gays?

Gay Man:
 Over here.

Peter:
 No, no, no. The cartoony gay guys.

Cartoony Gay Guy:
 Yoooo-hoooooo!!!

Peter:
 There you are, we're gonna need you guys all week.

Cleveland:
 Hey, Death. What are you doing here?

Death:
 Actually, I'm...here for your show.

Cleveland:
 Ah, come on, man. I'm on vacation.

Peter:
 And you still won't give us an Emmy?! Come on! If Modern Family did that joke, you'd be carrying them around on your shoulders!

Chris:
 Hey, Dad, are you busy? I was thinking we could spend some time together.

Peter:
 Okay, are you a television set on the Internet?

Chris:
 No.

Peter:
 Oh, then no.

s Twin:
 Close the door! The moonlight burns!

Peter:
 It's almost Christmas. It's almost Christmas.

s Twin:
 Christmas?

Peter:
 Yes. Keep being good, and all the eggshells and coffee grounds will be yours.

s Twin:
 Can I meet the family?

Peter:
 You've overstepped! No Christmas!

Carter:
 [about his broken leg] The worst part about it is I can't have sex! God, I wish there was a way I could just do it myself, you know, just to be done and napping within four minutes.

Chris:
 Let me show you something...

Carter:
 That... was... amazing! And Lynda Carter wasn't here?

Chris:
 No, that was just in your mind!

Carter:
 Incredible! So you can do that, like what, once a year or something?

Chris:
 No, you can do it basically whenever you're not doing something else.

Carter:
 Cool! Hey, next time I wanna try it with my hand.

Stewie:
 That was a stroller, not a speedbump.

Chris:
 What if I said "Hey there, shorty!"?

Stewie:
 I'd say "Have another donut, you albino gorilla."

Tough guy:
 Smells like this guy's already wet himself.

Peter:
 Don't flatter yourself, that was from this morning.

Peter:
 Huh, it says "Glenn Quagmire". But if you squint and imagine it says "Peter Griffin", it says "Peter Griffin".

Lois:
 Peter, it's Quagmire's. Take it next door.

Peter:
 Now, now, hold on, Lois. Now, this poses a very difficult ethical dilemma. Do I deliver the package to its rightful owner? Or do I open it up and see if it contains He-Mans?

Lois:
 Do not open that box!

Cowardly Lion:
 Hey. I'm the Rational Lion. So fuck you guys.

Peter:
 Wow. I haven't felt this powerful since I got to decide which ant lives and which ant dies.

Peter:
 You shall battle to the death, and the winner will be given his freedom! Why are you looking at me like that?

Lois:
 Peter, would you like a glass of-- [sees a decapitated Peter with a bloodied neck] OH, MY GOD! I TOLD YOU NOT TO PLAY GOD WITH THOSE ANTS!

Joe:
 I think next time you should bring someone else.

Stewie:
 Hey, what happened to my new friend...that kid who sort of looks like me from behind?

Chris:
 How were all your business trips?

Peter:
 Oh, exemplary, Chris.

Chris:
 I don't understand what either of those words means.

Stewie:
 One of them was "Chris."

Peter:
 Shall we away for "relations"?

Lois:
 I'm not sure what you're saying, but let's hump!

Lois:
 What's wrong with you, Peter?!

Peter:
 Lois, I'm sorry.

Lois:
 How the hell can you possibly mistake another baby for Stewie?!

Peter:
 Now, calm down, Lois. You're gonna say something you don't mean.

Lois:
 [Angry] Oh no, I'm not! You're an idiot!

Peter:
 [Hurt] You don't mean that...

Stewie:
 [Stewie looks at Facebook on his phone] I already got a Facebook friend request from the Dad. Is that weird?

Lois:
 Peter, I have put up with your nonsense for 20 years, but today, you crossed the line! You left a helpless baby in the public park, and that's something only an idiot would do!

Peter:
 I'm not an idiot!

eyed Man:
 Hey, I think there was a mix-up at the park. [he gives Peter his eye back]

Peter:
 Awesome!

Lobster:
 Hey, Chris...these [clacks its claws] on her nipples. Ha, ha, ha.

Chris:
 [to a passing waiter] Kill that one.

Skunk:
 [to Brian] Oh, you don't like smell, huh? Well, sniff on this!

Retep:
 My name is Retep and I am evil!

Brian:
 Holy crap! I'm so much faster on all fours! [trips over a rock and groans] What's that big rock doing there?

Retep:
 (cackles maniacally).

Peter:
 Huh. Look down there. That guy looks like me with a green shirt. He's murdering a lady!

Stewie:
 The rules of this city are very unclear.

Meg:
 You never got to pursue your dream. No wonder you hate me.

Peter:
 I don't hate you, Meg. You're my kid.

Meg:
 Dad I'm sorry to tell you this but I can't go with you.

Meg:
 I just got off the phone with Green Mountain College and they said they'll let me reschedule my interview so I'm going to drive back up there it's time for me to get serious about my life and start taking some responsibility.

Cleveland:
 Wassup?! [The Cleveland Show theme music plays as Cleveland approaches the guys]

Peter:
 [normally] Oh, hey, Cleveland!

Joe:
 Hi!

Quagmire:
 Wait, don't you have a show to do...[chuckles] Oh wait, that's right!

Cleveland:
 Alright, I knew this was comin'! Everybody, gimme your best shot!

Quagmire:
 Oh, my G - where do I even begin? You know, it's not a good sign that this is the first time a lot of people are realizing you had a show!

Joe:
 Your logo was stupid. Looked like a big purple penis and your ratings blew.

Cleveland:
 We did about the same as Bob's Burgers.

Quagmire:
 That's your bar?! Oh, shame on you!

Cleveland:
 This is good. This is constructive.

Quagmire:
 The talking bear was so bad, Seth MacFarlene quit voicing him after Season 2.

Cleveland:
 It's hard to make a talkin' bear funny.

Quagmire:
 [laughs] It worked out okay in movie form!

Joe:
 What was supposed to be the show's audience? Who did you make it for? Like, some black guy who never met another black guy?

Cleveland:
 Anything else?

Peter:
 Yeah, here's four seasons' worth of DVDs of what we've been up to. You know, just so you're back up to speed. And I'll warn ya ahead of time - these have jokes in 'em.

Cleveland:
 I...I don't have a DVD player.

Stewie:
 Hey, Lois, look, I'm smoking! You can't control dick! I'm a roof baby now!

Stewie:
 She is camel-toeing the hell out of that leotard.

Peter and Chris:
 Unga-Bunga! Unga-Bunga! Unga-Bunga!

Stewie:
 What is that? What's happening?

Peter and Chris:
 [carrying mattresses] Unga-Bunga! Unga-Bunga! Unga-Bunga!

Brian:
 Peter, what are you doing?

Peter:
 Playing "Unga-Bunga". It's the championship.

Stewie:
 Go away! This is why Zillow estimates our house at $4.00.

Brian:
 What the hell is "Unga-Bunga"?

Peter:
 Two guys run into each other with mattresses and, um, that's kinda it.

Chris:
 Stop explaining it to the dog! Let's do this!

Stewie:
 Stop it! I'm trying to watch my program!

Peter:
 Whoa, Chris, look! Mom's naked!

Chris:
 Where?

Peter:
 [whacks Chris with his mattress] You creep. [Chris crashes into the TV and breaks it]

Stewie:
 [gasp] No!

Lois:
 Peter, what's going on in...

Peter:
 [whacks Lois with his mattress] Unga-Bunga!

Stewie:
 You... You imbeciles! You've ruined my night! I asked for one thing in this house!

Brian:
 Stewie, just watch your show upstairs.

Stewie:
 I don't want to watch it upstairs on the small TV, I want to watch it downstairs on the big TV! [his face turns red with anger as he starts crying] I WANNA WATCH MY SHOW! [cries, throws himself on the ground and starts throwing his tantrum]

Lois:
 Oh no, Stewie's havin' a tantrum. Come here, sweetie. [Stewie bites her thumb] OW! Screw you, ya little turd!

Meg:
 [enters the living room] What's all that noise? [sees Stewie upset] Aw, do you want a hug from your big sister? [picks Stewie up and is headbutted] OW!

Lois:
 [puts Stewie in his bed] You just earned yourself a time-out, young man! Now you stay in here until you can behave! [closes the door]

Stewie:
 I HATE YOU! You always ruin everything! God, it's a family of idiots! I wish...I wish I was never born! [he sees Rupert wearing a fire helmet] Not tonight, Rupert. I'm much too upset.

Peter:
 Toast house!

Stewie:
 It's not just the TV show, Brian! I'm tired of living with morons! Remember that time I opened that lemonade stand with Chris?

Stewie:
 Alright, that will be ten cents. Chris, pour the man his lemonade.

Chris:
 [trapped in a pitcher] I can't! The lemonade tricked me, and ran away!

Lemonade:
 [runs away] Lemons are God's children!

Lois:
 Happy birthday, Stewie. And here's your equal attention cake, Peter.

Peter:
 Yay! [blows out both candles]

Stewie:
 Oh, come on!

Peter:
 Yay! Double wishes! [a meteorite falls on Meg] One... [the meteorite splits in half to reveal a Snickers bar inside] Two!

Lois:
 Oh, my God! Peter, what happened to your hair?

Peter:
 I don't know. I'm bald! [notices the razor on Lois' lap] You did this! What the hell is wrong with you?!

Lois:
 I didn't do it, but you look kinda cool.

Peter:
 I do?

Lois:
 Yeah, you look like you could be a celebrity.

Peter:
 Lois, what the hell did you do?! I just got a note from Goodwill thanking me for donating all my porn!

Lois:
 WHAT?! I'm sick and tired of you blaming me for things I didn't do! And I've got a bone to pick with you! I don't appreciate how you spray-painted "vile woman" on the bedroom wall.

Peter:
 That wasn't me! It must've been one of the kids!

Lois:
 That's ridiculous, Peter! Chris can't write, and we don't allow Meg upstairs!

Peter:
 Well, you know what? I'm starting to think whoever wrote that is right!

Lois:
 Well, maybe I don't wanna live with someone who doesn't respect me!

Peter:
 Well then, maybe I should just leave!

Lois:
 And where are you gonna go?! You got nothing else and nobody else!

Brian:
 Looks like we're in a town called "Springfield".

Stewie:
 Springfield, eh? What state?

Brian:
 I can't imagine we're allowed to say.

Lois:
 Oh, this Springfield place looks nice. We should visit here again.

Brian:
 I dunno, Lois. This seems like a one-shot deal.

Peter:
 Don't drink the water. Everyone around here looks like they have hepatitis.

Lois:
 Thank you so much for putting us up until we find our car.

Marge:
 And thank you for not being a band of hippie murderers.

Bart:
 Eat my shorts!

Stewie:
 "Eat my shorts". I love that. Is that a popular expression like "what the deuce"?

Brian:
 Probably more popular.

Peter:
 [to Apu] Hello, funny-sounding Cleveland!

Homer:
 Apu, a dozen donuts for our albino visitors.

Peter:
 Mmm. Yummy. Donut.

Homer:
 That's pretty good, but try it like this. Mmm...donut...

Peter:
 Mmm... donut...

Homer:
 I think you and I are gonna get along just okay.

Moe:
 Moe's Tavern, Moe speakin'.

Bart:
 Uh, yeah, I'm looking for a friend, last name Kebum, first name Lee.

Moe:
 Eh, hang on, I'll check. Uh, hey, guys, do I have a Lee Kebum? C'mon, look at the stools. Is there a Lee Kebum? Somebody check the rear, I know I have a Lee Kebun.

Barney:
 Then you probably shouldn't be handling food!

Stewie:
 Hello, Moe? Your sister's being raped!

Bob Belcher:
 Yeah, we did it!

Homer:
 What's he doing here?

Peter:
 Oh, we gotta carry him 'cause he can't fly alone. We let that other guy try and look at what happened.

Cleveland:
 No, no, no, no, no, NO!

Peter:
 That's pretty good, right?

Homer:
 No.

Homer:
 It's not good. This beer tastes exactly like Duff. It's just a lousy ripoff!

Peter:
 Hey, whoa whoa whoa! It's not a ripoff of Duff! It may have been inspired by Duff, but I...I like to think it goes in a different direction.

Homer:
 No, this is just the same as Duff, but, like, worse!

Peter:
 Hey, come on, now, this is my favorite beer you're talking about! Hell, I work for the company. It's my livelihood!

Moe:
 [takes the beer] Oh, yeah? Well, your livelihood is based on fraud. Look at this. [Rips off the Pawtucket Patriot Ale label, revealing the Duff Beer label underneath] Huh?!

Homer:
 [gasps] IT IS DUFF! Your beer is in big trouble! You can't just slap a new label on something and call it your own!

Peter:
 Well, maybe Duff should be in trouble for, you know, not being that great.

Homer:
 [gasps] Duff is an ICON!

Peter:
 Yeah, but some folks prefer Pawtucket Pat. I mean, don't get me wrong. I used to love Duff when I was younger, but, I haven't even had it in 13 years.

Blue Haired Lawyer:
 Be that as it may, I represent the Duff Brewery. And you sir, as a representative of Pawtucket Patriot Ale, are being sued for intellectual theft and patent infringement.

Homer:
 Ah-ha! Intellectual infringement. What do you have to say about that, Griffin?!

Peter:
 D'oh!

Judge:
 I've heard all I need to hear to make a decision. [The camera switches to the judge, who is revealed to be Fred Flintstone]

Fred Flintstone:
 If you ask me, neither of these beers is wholly original. They're both pale imitations of my favorite beer, Bud Rock.

Peter:
 Oh-ho-ho!

Homer:
 Ooh!

Fred Flintstone:
 But rendering a verdict is something I'm paid to YABBA DABBA DOOOOO!

Homer and Peter:
 Eh.

Fred Flintstone:
 And I find in favor of Duff!

Peter:
 Oh, no!

Peter:
 [Answers his cellphone] Hello?

Aid Man:
 Uh, hey. I'm... I'm in the wrong Springfield.

Homer:
 Hey, knock it off! There's a kid back there!

Ralph:
 Heh-heh, I'm in danger!

Krusty:
 Remember, kids - TV violence is funny as long as you don't show a nipple!

Kodos:
 Perfect, the Earthlings are destroying themselves.

Roger:
 Yeah, it's great, isn't it, guys? [to the camera] We went to summer camp together.

Peter:
 It appears that I am now the only one with radioactive powers, which will allow me to unleash my fury... [the radioactivity wears off] Oh, I talked too long.

Peter:
 Ow! What the hell?! That hurts!

Homer:
 No, it doesn't! I do that to my son all the time!

Peter:
 You strangle your son? That's insane! No wonder he's fat and stupid and masturbates all the time!

Homer:
 That's your son!

Peter:
 [Homer throws multiple Emmys at Peter, who dodges them] Hey, that's not fair! I don't have any of them!

Peter:
 We're gonna make it!

Homer:
 Trust me, we're not.

Homer:
 Say "hi" to Maude Flanders!

Peter:
 No, you say "hi" to Muriel Goldman!

Homer:
 Who?

Comic Book Guy:
 Worst chicken fight ever.

Brian:
 Could you close the gate? A couple of calves got loose. Pow!

Parent:
 You're awful!

Peter:
 Applause is customary.

Stewie:
 Lois! Lois! Mommy!

Brian:
 Stewie, what's going on? You should be asleep by now.

Stewie:
 I can't sleep, Brian. Where's the woman? I need her to read me a bedtime story.

Brian:
 Oh, she's busy with the blood drive. Maybe I can help. [grabs a book] How about I read you this one? It's called "Apathetic George". [reads the book] "George used to be a curious monkey, but after a month in captivity, all he did was wait for food. The zoo people wanted him to mate, but he lost interest in that, too. Twenty years and millions of dollars in zoo revenue later, he died."

Stewie:
 Okay, I've had enough.

Brian:
 All right, you know what? I know something that will help you sleep. Wait here.

Stewie:
 Well, I hope so, because I've tried everything. Counting sheep and thinking sleepy thoughts. I even hired the Sandman.

Sandman:
 Sand and sand and sand and sand and sand and sand and good night!

Tom Tucker:
 Coming up: Local newsman shows a camera operator how to center a shot.

Mosquito:
 Hi, I'm the new nurse.

Lois:
 Get outta here. The blood's not for you.

Mosquito:
 Aww. Oh, look, an empty tire with some water in it. All right, I'm happy again.

Brian:
 Bonnie, I still don't get why you want to see this house. The foundation is totally out of whack. I mean, the whole house is slanting down to that cliff over there.

Bonnie:
 Uh-huh. Can you open the sliding door? [Brian complies as Bonnie releases a wheelchair with a large bag of potatoes acting as a weight. The wheelchair rolls easily through the door and smashes on the rocks below the cliff] I'll take it.

Brian:
 [injured because of Peter's greed] Damn it, Peter! What the hell were you thinking?! This has to be the dumbest thing you've ever done!

Peter:
 No, the dumbest thing I ever did was turn the bubbles off in a hot tub. [cut to the said incident] Yeah, party! [shuts off the bubbles] Eww, baths with friends.

Stewie:
 Brian, what are you doing?

Brian:
 I'm hiding from Quagmire for a few more hours. After that, he won't be able to pull out of that deal.

Stewie:
 Well, if anybody knows how to "pull out", it's Quagmire.

Quagmire:
 You are such a scumbag. You know, when you were poor, you were always a douche, but at least you came by it honestly. But now? Screwin' over the people who helped you?! I don't know how you sleep at night.

Brian:
 [sighs] My God. You're right! I'm a jerk. I'm a selfish and pretentious jerk, and you're the only guy in town who's ever called me out on my crap. You know, I used to hate you for it, but now I think you're the only person who is trying to be my friend.

Quagmire:
 No, I think you're misunderstanding me.

Brian:
 No, I'm serious. Even though I know you never liked me, you still helped me when I needed it. That says a lot about your character. I'm ashamed of myself because I am none of the things you are. You're honest and direct and compassionate and... [his phone chimes] that is 72 hours! Enjoy your craphole, dumbass!

Quagmire:
 You son of a bitch!

Brian:
 Peter, what the hell?! You chose a turkey over me?! I almost died!

Peter:
 I swear to God, I thought dogs could breathe underwater.

Joe:
 Hey, do you think if I let Jesus sleep with Bonnie, he'd give me back the use of my legs?

Peter:
 Joe, I don't speak for Jesus, I just get him trim.

Jesus:
 Lois, it seems like you learned the lesson I intended.

Peter:
 What lesson?

Jesus:
 Oh, you know, uh... That... this holiest of days is about... uh... appreciating our loved ones and, uh... resisting temptation.

Lois:
 Oh, so it was a test. Like when your Father told Abraham to sacrifice Isaac.

Jesus:
 Yes, that! That’s exactly right. Uh, well... I can see my work here is done...

Peter:
 Well taught, Jesus. Well taught.

Jesus:
 Yeah, I guess, who cares, I’m not even real. Merry Christmas.

Rupert:
 Hey, everybody, just so you know, I'm straight!

st German Soldier:
 Heil Hooters!

Otto:
 Careful, it might be a "booby-trap".

Chris:
 This would make a great movie.

Brian:
 I mean I was having fun, making new friends, getting laid all the time, sleeping like a rock, but you made the call. You unilaterally decided I was better off as a bitter alcoholic failure who could only hang out with a baby.

Stewie:
 Hey! We have fun.

Ruth:
 Your mom's so hot!

Peter:
 Well, there's only one thing we can do: shrink down to microscopic size, enter Brian's brain and destroy the tumor from within. [Peter grabs a shrink ray and reduces himself down to microscopic size, but then resizes four seconds later] I was raped by a bug.

Stewie:
 Alright, let's lay some ground rules here. You take her left side, I'll take her right.

Brian:
 What? Uh, how about top and bottom or front and back?

Stewie:
 How about I take the head, shoulders, knees, and toes, knees and toes?

Brian:
 Okay, you can have those.

Stewie:
 You just gave away the store mister.

 Finklestein:
 [discovers cash in the dead man's billfold] It's a five! A five!

Meg:
 All right. See you later.

Lois:
 Where are you off to?

Meg:
 Actually, I met a photographer at Stewie's school yesterday, and he wants me to model for him.

Peter:
 [showing his ears he ripped off to Lois] Lois, please send these back to the factory. I believe they're defective.

Lois:
 Oh my God, Peter, did you just rip your ears off?

Peter:
 It was the easiest way to let her know the news was ridiculous. [Collapses]

Stewie:
 [whispering to Brian] Dairy Queen closes in ten minutes.

Judge:
 I have no choice but to sentence you to 20 years in prison!

Female Voice:
 Oh no you don't!

Quagmire:
 Mom?

All the men in the courtroom:
 Crystal?

Peter:
 [singing through microphone after waiting long about throwing up in the sink] Out here in the fields… You know, that was me. I was the one who threw up in the sink.

Lois:
 Peter, are you just trying to take a knee until the end of the show? Peter, that's not gonna work, you can't just...

Chris:
 It's made of Skittles! Do you want to eat the baby together on the way home?

Lois:
 Yeah, I'd like that.

Peter:
 Now, what are the ingredients of a viral internet video?

Joe:
 Cats.

Stewie:
 I have a such craving for burgers. It's like my body is just craving red meat, mint chip ice cream, and only mint chip. Any other ice cream makes me want to puke. Is that weird?

Brian:
 Yes, Stewie. That's the one weird thing in all this.

Adam West:
 [observing Stewie giving birth in Brian's car] Mazel tov!

Peter:
 Remember how everyone liked that video of the monkey performing a sex act on that frog at the zoo?

Joe:
 You mean that frog?

Joe:
 The frog in the miniskirt putting a quarter in the jukebox.

Peter:
 [filming on his phone] Bingo.

Joe:
 [with a worried expression] I'm concerned that frog's in more danger than she realizes.

Lois:
 So...so what do I do? Just aim for the pond?

Peter:
 No, you're not supposed to hit it into the water.

Lois:
 But you hit it into the water.

Peter:
 [exasperated] I know I hit it into the water.

Lois:
 But why do they even have water if you're not supposed to hit it there?

Peter:
 BECAUSE IT'S FUN! WE'RE HAVING FUN! [growling in frustration, he furiously throws his bag of clubs]

Lois:
 Look! It went further than your ball!

Peter:
 Get all of her squawking out, doc?

Cleveland:
 Oh, I think we got to the root of the problem. Didn't we, Lois?

Lois:
 Absolutely.

Peter:
 Alright! Let's dope her up good. Turn that mouth off.

TSA Agent:
 There you are. Listen up, Meg. This TSA isn't sweaty enough for the two of us.

Meg:
 What? What does that even mean?

TSA Agent:
 It means stay away from Larry. I'm his girlfriend.

Meg:
 You are? Oh, my God, I thought you were a boy.

Announcer:
 Hey! Are you a big fat bastard who loves eating at an outback steakhouse but thinks the portions are too small? Well, good news, fatass! 'Cause now there's the Outback Steakhouse Extreme! We don't have a blooming onion, we have a blooming pumpkin! Do you know what else we've got? Elephant steaks! Fifty-pound elephant steaks! And why don't you wash it down out with forty ounces of malt liquor and ranch dressing, ya fat fuck? Outback Steakhouse Extreme: PUNISH! YOUR!! TOILET!!!

Joe:
 Peter, be careful up there.

Peter:
 Is this being careful enough, Joe?

Peter:
 [to Quagmire and Cleveland] Guys, keep swallowing water. We'll drink our way out of this!

TV Announcer:
 We now return to yet another Indiana Jones movie.

Man:
 Snakes. Why did it have to be snakes?

Snake:
 Elderly potheads. Why did it have to be elderly potheads?

Brian:
 Is everyone warm in here? Is it warm?

Lois:
 Brian, are you feeling all right?

Brian:
 Yeah, I'm fine. It just seems kind of... (retching loudly)

Peter:
 Oh, Lois, your dog threw up.

Lois:
 Peter, Brian's not feeling well. You got to take him to the vet.

Meg:
 Unbelievable! Brian throws up once, and you rush him to the vet. I was throwing up all night last night.

Peter:
 Good start. Keep it up, snack pack.

Brian:
 (chuckles) (retching loudly)

Lois:
 Peter, you got to take him now!

Brian:
 Lois, it's probably just something I ate. I'm fine. Really. I got more energy than a cruise ship conga line.

Peter:
 Alright, Brian, it's time for you to take one of these pills from the vet.

Brian:
 Uh, yeah, right. Can we do what we normally where we normally roll it up in a piece of cheese like you're fooling me?

Brian:
 Peter, get away from my ass!

Neil:
 [to Meg sadly] I'm sorry, but my friendship with Chris is more important.

Meg:
 You're a JERK, Neil!

Peter:
 This is because I'm drunk!

Cleveland:
 Move out, Irish trash!

Quagmire:
 Thank you, thank you, thank you very much. Joe, I'd tell you to take your seat, but I'd be about 15 years too late.

Quagmire:
 Well first off, Peter's always been special. In high school, he didn't play sports, but he did wear a helmet.

Quagmire:
 But I gotta say the worst part about being Peter's friend is knowing that eventually you're gonna have to be the fatass' pallbearer. Lift with the legs, right fellas?

Cleveland:
 Peter's got a small penis. But, hey, nothing grows in the shade!

Carter:
 As Lois' father, I hate the thought of her having sex with Peter.

Lois:
 And so do I!

Carl:
 I asked Peter what he got on his SATs. He said "Mayonnaise."

Mort Goldman:
 Peter's so fat and stupid, Lamar Odom tried to bang him!

Jerome:
 Peter, you're loud. You can't hold down a job. You got high blood pressure. You could be black if you didn't have a tiny ding-a-ling!

Liam Neeson:
 I have played a lion in three separate films. Peter Griffin has never played a jungle cat of any sort, not even a smallish one, like a lynx.

Peter:
 You ever got your ass handed to you by a Type 2 diabetic?

Stewie:
 Hey, you know that old woman who lived in a shoe? She had so many children she didn't know what to do. I know what she should do: get your tubes tied, ya kook!

Peter:
 We're here to see Liam Neeson, the guy who wears the same long jacket in his movies.

Lois:
 I feel... unappreciated. Like you don't want to spend time with me.

Peter:
 Okay, I feel a numbness radiating from my left arm.

Donna:
 I feel like you should help out more around the house.

Cleveland:
 I feel salty and sweet. (to the counselor): You got white-chocolate French fries?

Kimi:
 I feel like my cervix hurts.

Counselor:
 Peter, when is Lois' birthday?

Peter:
 Uh, let's see. When is Hitler's birthday?

Counselor:
 April 20th.

Peter:
 Wow. Okay, Noel. Yikes.

Counselor:
 Joe, what is Bonnie's favorite food?

Joe:
 Well, she must like ground glass because I keep finding it in my food.

Counselor:
 Cleveland-

Cleveland:
 Pass.

Counselor:
 Quagmire, what color are Kimi's eyes?

Quagmire:
 Shaved. S-sorry, what is it? What was the question?

Brian:
 [referring to George R. R. Martin] God, he must be the coolest fat guy in a train conductor's cap in the world!

Quagmire:
 How do you think NBA players get all those chicks? They're all great cooks. Except for Kobe Bryant. His secret is different.

Quagmire:
 [referencing an awful Korean Taco] Ugggh! This tastes like Ani DiFranco after a bike ride!

Stewie:
 [seductively to a little girl at nap time in school] Hey? Are you up? Guess where I have a crayon...

Bud:
 Thanks for the ride along. I liked it when you sentenced those two girls to kiss each other.

Peter:
 Yeah, all girls are lesbians when you point a gun at them.

Brian:
 Hey, what are you doing home so early?

Stewie:
 He's following me, Brian.

Brian:
 Who's following you?

Stewie:
 Tom Cruise. I spent one afternoon with the guy and it's like I signed an eight-year contract to show up at events with him and let him fake-father a child.

Brian:
 Stewie, I think Tom Cruise has better things to do than follow you around.

Stewie:
 Oh really, well explain that. [points at Tom Cruise outside]

Brian:
 You know, it's times like this where I think, if I didn't talk and you were a normal baby, we wouldn't have any of these problems.

Peter:
 I like to eat a big bowl of berries before I go to sleep.

Stewie:
 You're just horrible. You're even worse than those people who take dumps in the shower.

Meg:
 What? Why are you cutting to me? What did somebody say? Whatever they say I do, I don't do.

Peter:
 Sorry, someone e-mailed me a video of a sheep screaming.

Lois:
 Oh, my God! Peter, come look at the newspaper! "Jan Itter dead".

Peter:
 (gasps) What?! No!

Lois:
 Right here, my college roommate, Jan Itter. She passed away yesterday.

Peter:
 A-are we seriously doing this? Because I didn't get like, any sleep last night.

Lois:
 What are you freaking out about? You didn't even know her.

Peter:
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're right. [leaves the kitchen]

Lois:
 You and the guys killed and buried a man?!

Peter:
 Aah! I knew you would find out!

Lois:
 Find out about what? I just got David Sedaris's new book: "You and the Guys Killed and Buried a Man".

Peter:
 Okay, I am seriously on edge, and this thing we're doing, I'm not happy about it, and that's a very odd title for a humorist book!

Lois:
 Peter, you're acting weird. Just go to the other room.

Peter:
 I don't wanna go to the other room! I wanna stay here and see what you're seeing 'cause you're saying things that are different than what they are!

Lois:
 Peter, you're gonna have a heart attack. I won't say anything else. I'll let you relax.

Brian:
 It's just when you've read as many books as I have [chuckles] it takes a toll, you know?

Stewie:
 Are you sure it's not from watching too much close-up porn on your phone?

Peter:
 What if God is a serial killer? He lowers the average lifespan of humans to 65 and three are many exceptions based on genetics and diet.

Cleveland:
 That's stupid. I've never heard of somebody living to 65.

Peter:
 I'm very easily influenced by music.

Chris:
 Apologies for being so tardy.

Peter:
 Ah, Chris, you're not tardy. We tested you twice.

Peter:
 [demonic voice] I see the six stations of the Lord's order, and they will all burn!

Carter:
 I couldn't figure out how to use your oven, so I destroyed it in a blind rage.

Quagmire:
 Peter's a good friend. Not like Cleveland.

Peter:
 Or you can pull the hose out of the bucket and let the hose run free.

Peter:
 There are gaps in my knowledge. This is hardly news.

Lois:
 The secret to happiness is burying all your true feelings and living a life of bland compromise.

Brian:
 [trying to pick up Tori] You know, some people are okay with a drive-through car wash. Me, I'm a fan of the hand job.

Stewie:
 Brian? What are you doing on a leash? And who's that?

Brian:
 [quietly] Shhh, be cool. This is the guy whose wife I'm banging.

Stewie:
 Oh, what a romantic way to put it.

Brian:
 Yeah, it's great. I just pretend to be their dog, and then when he leaves for work, I get to go to the "pound" if you know what I mean.

Cleveland:
 You want the media to go away? Just mention black-on-black crime.

Brian:
 I'm just saying. It's no surprise that justice isn't colorblind.

Brian:
 I don't think it's lost on any of us that the laws are written on white paper.

Lawyer:
 Don't worry, Mr. Griffin. You're every bit as sympathetic as this chubby-cheeked coco angel.

Joe:
 Public opinion has shifted, and the boys upstairs said they can no longer ignore it.

Peter:
 Who the hell are the boys upstairs?

Peter:
 Lois, I am an unelected vigilante and take my job very seriously.

Peter:
 Wow, that girl's hot.

Quagmire:
 That's a guy.

Peter:
 That other guy's handsome.

Quagmire:
 That's a girl.

Peter:
 That cat is cute.

Quagmire:
 That's a dog.

Peter:
 WHAT IS EVERYTHING?!

Quagmire:
 Wow, this is even more pussy than I can handle!

Cleveland:
 [thinking] Is he gonna say "Giggity"? Should I say "Giggity"? Are other people allowed to say "Giggity"? [talking] Giggity.

Cleveland:
 [mumbles] Nothing, it's stupid.

Peter:
 Dear God, it's the Griffins. Again, we're very sorry we cyberbullied that girl to death, but we still want a snowmobile. Today though, please let there be money in our bank account. Amen.

Family:
 Amen.

Peter:
 Hey, Lois, check out what I found with my metal detector.

Lois:
 Are those...are those Purple Hearts?

Peter:
 Yeah, some idiot buried like 100 of them in this big lawn underneath bone cages.

Lois:
 Peter! I think you desecrated a military graveyard!

Brian:
 Hey, guys, there are four jeeps outside our house.

Carter:
 Now what do you want to do?

Peter:
 Well, we could watch porn. Have you heard of porn? Is that something you're aware of?

Carter:
 [excited] You have postcards from France?

Carter:
 Tear it all down, now! Or I'm canceling Kwanzaa!

Thug:
 What is "Kwanzaa"?

Carter:
 Ha! I knew it wasn't real!

Cleveland:
 Guys, calm down. There's one way to solve this. I'll just use my phone.

Cleveland:
 It says "Around the World", by Daft Punk."

Quagmire:
 Thank you! God, you idiots are exhausting.

Peter:
 Hey, Cleveland, how'd you do that with your phone?

Joe:
 I am not an idiot.

Cleveland:
 I used Shazam. It recognizes songs and tells you their names.

Peter:
 Yeah? Hey, what if I farted into it?

Cleveland:
 I don't know. Be my guest.

Peter:
 It says "Lana Del Rey."

Lois:
 What are you doing?

Peter:
 Well, I just found out about these things called Apps, so that's kind of all I do now.

Referee:
 Out!

Referee:
 Your ball was long.

Stewie:
 [angry] Are you shitting me? That thing was in! You're gonna penalize us because you're a blind, fucking, blue jacket piece of shit?!

Brian:
 Stewie, calm down!

Stewie:
 I will drop you to your knees and shove my racket so far down your throat, you'll be shitting my grip for a week!

Referee:
 Warning, Mr. Griffin.

Stewie:
 Oh, you're warning me? I'm warning you! I'm gonna go to your house and fuck your wife!

Stewie:
 You proud of yourself? Tennis Club security guard? Your kids look up to you? Big man, throwing out a baby and a dog. Tough guy. Maybe I'll see you later when you don't have that name tag on.

Security Guard:
 I thought your shot was in.

Stewie:
 [happy] Oh, hey! Pound it, dude!

Tricia:
 Joyce, I'm standing here on the streets of Quahog, where citizens are feeling the effects of the city's new drinking law.

Peter:
 [whistling after Brian] Come here, boy! Come on!

Brian:
 [happily wags his tail] Hey, what's up? Are we going for a ride in the car?

Peter:
 No, I had a question for you.

Brian:
 Don't EVER do that unless you have a car ride to offer!

Stewie:
 I want you to come inside me while I'm asleep.

Brian:
 No, don't. Don't say it like that.

Stewie:
 And once you're in my dream, your job is to stop these nightmares by finding that monster and killing him! This isn't a job for the meek, Brian. When you get in there, you've got to be hard.

Brian:
 Okay, but that felt intentional.

Tom:
 Adult stuff. Adult stuff. Adult stuff. The world is scary. Adult stuff. Adult stuff. Scary people yelling in another part of the world. Adult stuff.

Stewie:
 [screams] I wish Mom wouldn't watch the news in front of me! [he and Brian flee]

Tom:
 Coming up, a map with a hurricane on it, and you don't know your states yet!

Joe:
 Peter, I'm going crazy up here.

Cleveland:
 We all are. You gotta talk to Lois.

Peter:
 Damn it, you're right. Lois, let us out of here!

Lois:
 No way! You like it so much?! Then you can rot up there with your buddies!

Peter:
 Lois, so help me God, if you don't let us out right this second, I'm gonna take a dump on your wedding dress!

Lois:
 You wouldn't dare!

Peter:
 Don't test me. I'll do it! We'll all do it! Quagmire, pull down your pants!

Quagmire:
 What I'm not doing with that?!

Lois:
 You leave my dress alone, Peter!

Cleveland:
 If we'll don't get us out of here, I'll make a doodie on it.

Quagmire:
 What are you nuts?!

Cleveland:
 I've been crowning for 6 hours!

Peter:
 Cleveland's pants are off, Lois! Here come mine! This is happening!

Quagmire:
 Lois, they're not bluffing! Open the door!

Joe:
 I miss Bonnie!

Lois:
 Damn it, Peter, you hold that in! I know you can you did it on the ferry to Block Island!

Quagmire:
 Oh my God, I'm gonna puke!

Peter:
 That's good! Puke on the dress! Puke on the dress!

Lois:
 [angry sighs] Dammit! [she comes into the bathroom to grab a towel holder off]

Lois:
 [she caves in and pries the door open, dumping them on the floor] There! You happy!?

Cleveland:
 You were too late. We pooed on the gown.

Joe:
 Ripped a big hole in your ceiling, too.

Quagmire:
 I barfed on Peter's ass. I-I don't know if it got on the dress or not, Lois, but I-I am...I am so sorry.

Peter:
 Yeah, this was all a huge disaster.

Lois:
 [inhales] Let's just agree that we both went a bit too far, hmm?

Quagmire:
 I might need 2 weeks off from this friendship...

Stewie:
 [Sarcastic] Oh, I sure hope the dog approves of who I am. I'm outta here, weirdo. There's a wedding dress out here covered in shit.

Brian:
 I know, I know. It was a huge mistake. Let's just do two or three high-fives and forget it ever happened.

Principal Shepherd:
 Good morning, children. It's that time of the year again to fulfill your community service requirements by signing up for volunteer work.

Meg:
 Do we get to choose our jobs?

Principal Shepherd:
 No, no no no. The jobs will be assigned randomly, but the cooler and prettier students have the better jobs. For instance, the blond chick in the third row will wash my car this afternoon. While Little Miss Frumpkin with all the questions will work in the old folks' home.

Meg:
 Is Frumpkin good?

Principal Shepherd:
 [chuckles] NO. No.

Peter:
 Before you read that, you need to know one thing. I'm the one who's been throwing out your beige bras. Guys don't like beige bras.

Peter:
 Gretchen? Wow. You look great.

Gretchen:
 Yeah. I didn't have kids, so...

Stewie:
 Hey, it's Stewie. All I know about cars is what my mom does.

Cleveland:
 Grab that letter opener over there. I'm going to show you why you should never mail cash.

Peter:
 Is that the one where they make him dress in little shorts and hats like the guy from AC/DC?

Brian:
 Yeah. Why does he wear that outfit?

Peter:
 'Cuz he rocks!

Cleveland:
 I'd be happy to get you an interview. And as a white woman, you'd be the minority here. Unless you're an alcoholic.

Shelby:
 I know I'm a nerd, but I have a thing for rich guys.

Stewie:
 I ate a dime once. It became a manhole cover for like three days, then pow!

Bonnie:
 I've never seen a bulge in the front of a man's pants before.

Lois:
 Did you see that sweet new piece of ass, Dallas Portland?

Bonnie:
 Oh, I don't know. Why don't you ask my index and middle finger?

Chris:
 You know, Brian, this wouldn't have happened if you were just honest with women and had an ounce of integrity!

Brian:
 Don't pull rank on me! You ate a ring, you worthless tub of crap!

Chris:
 Yeah? Well, who's gonna fish through a tub of crap soon, you unemployed butt-munch!

Stewie:
 Whoa, whoa! Let's calm down, guys!

Chris:
 SHUT UP, you unemployed butt-munch!

Stewie:
 Okay, he found a burn he likes.

Stewie:
 Oh my God. They just elected him out of pity, because they think he's mentally challenged.

Brian:
 Kind of like we did with George W. Bush, huh? Right?

Stewie:
 [loud sigh] I guess. I guess, Brian. I don't know. Let's just watch some commercials now.

Brian:
 They have security guards in the bathroom. We live in such a culture of fear now.

Stewie:
 Shut up, hat, that's my brother. They're not gonna mess with him. He's the man. He's got real Griffin beef in his trousers.

Peter:
 Cleveland, you didn't tell us you had plans with Jerome.

Cleveland:
 Some things are my business. You don't tell me when you play with yourself.

Peter:
 If you checked my Twitter feed, I wouldn't have to.

Quagmire:
 You know, this is great, guys. Drinking and eating garbage. I'm glad we all took a mental health day.

Neil:
 Well, Chris, looks like another day of nobody joining us for lunch.

Chris:
 Yeah, we never should have let that blind girl touch our faces.

Pam:
 So, what seems to be the problem?

Brian:
 Well, one problem I have is that I have too much money.

Pam:
 Then why don't you just buy a new computer?

Brian:
 What? ... Uh, ... I ...

Pam:
 Oh, I am just bursting your balls.

Brian:
 People in love can overcome anything.

Stewie:
 I guess you're right. I mean look at Jeb Bush and his wife.

Jeb:
 Honey, do you think I'll ever become president?

Consuela:
 No ... no ... no.

Brian:
 [angry] Stewie!

Stewie:
 What? It's just a joke.

Brian:
 Yeah, but come on!

Stewie:
 Look it up, man. Google her!

Brian:
 [admittedly] I know what she looks like.

Stewie:
 I can't believe we're in India. Oh, look over there. Those cute little kids are playing Cowboys and Indians and Indians.

Pam:
 Brian?

Brian:
 Pam

Pam:
 Why are you here?

Brian:
 Because I was having technical difficulties with my heart.

Stewie:
 Ugh, 16 hours on a plane and that's what you came up with?

Stewie:
 Let's go get sandwiches at that "new deli" I keep hearing about. [Ganesha performs a rimshot] Thanks, Ganesha.

Lois:
 What did he say? Brian, this does not seem appropriate to watch in front of the baby.

Stewie:
 "Not appropriate"? You took me to see Magic Mike XXL.

Lois:
 Huh, this one's wet. [looks at the seat next to her]: This one too. [walks to another seat]: Also wet. [looks at the seat next to her]: Huh, this one's dry, but the back of the seat in front of it is wet.

Quagmire:
 Okay, Chris, I think you'll be a great assistant. Your paperwork appears to be in order, but before we get started, do you own a pair of rubber boots that you'd have to wear if you worked on a fishing boat?

Chris:
 Uh, no, I don't think so.

Quagmire:
 Alright, I guess it'll be a light day today, but tomorrow, you should come wearing those.

Chris:
 Okay, got it.

Quagmire:
 Now, the first thing I need you to do is punch me in the stomach because I'm bad. [he stands up]

Chris:
 Is this a trick?

Quagmire:
 It's the furthest thing from a trick, go ahead. And it should be pretty hard, I'm a worse person than you think.

Quagmire:
 [strained] Okay, that's really good. Now I need you to call Time Warner about my cable bill.

Brian:
 It...it...it's actually "Brian". We've...we've met many times before.

Brian:
 I ... I really wouldn't know.

Stewie:
 This is a bad start to whatever he's doing.

Stewie:
 You uh...you keep meatballs in your jacket?

Announcer:
 Step right up. Everybody take a chance on Whack-A-Big Pussy.

Chris:
 This is not what I thought it was! RAAAAGH!

Lois:
 Oh my God, Chris is out of control!

Peter:
 I know. It must be all the violence in movies and sex on TV.

Lois:
 Ohhhh!

Peter:
 See, I listen!

Brian:
 Wow, what a day!

Stewie:
 Please don't comment.

Lois:
 [ignoring Stewie] Oh, look at you. Did you get a job?

Stewie:
 Bitch.

Stewie:
 There's a rat trap in that cabinet ... with a foot in it ... and somewhere in this house, there's a footless rat.

Quagmire:
 Ladies, this is your pilot speaking. I am in the full, upright, and locked position.

Peter:
 Oh, hey, it's that guy! Are you gonna say, Who else but Quagmire?

Who Else But Quagmire Guy:
 Uh, no, I, uh, wanted to know if Quagmire was available tomorrow evening.

Peter:
 Are you... Are you gay?

Who Else But Quagmire Guy:
 Uh, of course not, but I'm unable to properly have sex with my wife so I figure, you know, who else but Quagmire?

Peter:
 Hey, awesome cameo.

Lois:
 Is it your line?

Chris:
 I don't think so.

Stewie:
 I'm sorry, whose line is it?

Gary:
 Cut! That was Peter's line. Where's Peter?

Peter:
 Sorry, I was in my trailer eating fancy nuts and smoking.

Lois:
 Well, it certainly isn't easy being in a family that also happens to star in a sitcom together. Especially last year when I discovered those naked pictures of that 18-year-old intern on Peter's phone, but he explained that his phone number was the old number of her ex-boyfriend, so ... what was it again? ... So, the cloud. That's right. So, the photos were on the cloud and the cloud pulled the pictures uh ... I mean, even if the pictures had not been sent directly to him and that's why he has them and we both called the Apple store and they said that they can't disprove that it doesn't happen and so, here we are. Still married. Still on the show and it's happened five times since then some of the pictures have both Peter and the girl in them.

Peter:
 Oh, yeah. It's great, you know, doing the show with your family, cuz what guy doesn't want to go to his office and have his family there? You know, and then you go home after work and catch up with the family, [progressively gets more depressed as he keeps talking] and then next day same thing. Just trying to make it through the weekend, so you can uh ... spend some time with the family ... Isn't that the dream?

James Wood:
 It's not just the Griffins who work hard to make Family Guy what it is. Here in the props department, some sweaty guy is working on the Petercopter.

Sweaty Guy:
 That's right. You know, a lot of people don't realize, that SEAL Team Six completed their mission in this puppy.

Osama:
 Oh cool, Family Guy! Over here! I'm down here!

Quagmire:
 Look, don't get me wrong, guys. I think it's hilarious ... and I get that the sex thing is what made me popular, but ... would it kill us to just once tell a joke that brings glory to God?

Peter:
 Alright, red light. Time to text and shave and whittle and floss.

Stewie:
 You've just gotta do what Taylor Swift does and shake it off.

Chris:
 Who's Taylor Swift?

Stewie:
 Oh, my God! Am I about to introduce you to Taylor Swift?

Chris:
 What is she, a singer?

Stewie:
 She's much more than a singer, Chris. She's ... she's ... she's the queen! A goddess! A gazelle in a high-waisted swimsuit!

Peter:
 Name ... Peter Griffin. Criminal history ... This section is optional. I will skip this.

Stewie:
 [talking to Taylor Swift] Okay, so let's talk about Harry Styles. Now, you don't have to say anything. I'm just gonna slowly pull out this tape measure, and you indicate when I should stop. Okay, here I go. [Stewie starts pulling out the tape measure] Still going ... still going ... Oh my God, you bitch! Seriously?

Lois:
 Peter, we can't have a bat flying around the house. We gotta do something.

Peter:
 Don't worry, Lois, I'll get rid of it. It'll be a piece of cake. Just like my penis enhancement. [cutaway to Peter at the doctor's office] I want it to hang down to my knees. [Peter leaves the building, with extremely short legs] They moved up my knees.

Stewie:
 Ugh, this is going to be a Lois episode. [to the audience] Game of Thrones is on.

Gatsby:
 I came down here to think every night and gaze at that green light. It's where the love of my life lives. Daisy Buchanan.

Nick:
 Um, I hate to break it to you, but that green light you've been looking at is a gay gym called the Pump House. [nervously] I... I only know that because I... I saw a coupon that came with my rental.

Gatsby:
 You know, sometimes I just wanna jump off this balcony and into that pool down there.

Daisy:
 So do it.

Gatsby:
 Yeah, I know, right? [chuckles] Do it!

Daisy:
 Yeah, do it.

Gatsby:
 I know, I totally should, right? Here I go. 1... 2... 3... Whoa! [laughs] Can you imagine?

Daisy:
 Yeah, I can imagine. It would be fun. You should do it.

Gatsby:
 If only it were that easy, right?

Daisy:
 It is. It... It looks deep enough. It's your pool. It's your house. You can do whatever you want.

Gatsby:
 I know, right? Uh, you know, I can't right now. My pool guy's cleaning it.

RJ:
 Are you going to bone her?

Daisy:
 Nick, have you met Jordan? She plays golf and is what kids will someday call duff.

Nick:
 Hey, yeah. Nice Tam o'shanter.

Jordan:
 I'll drink your finger bowl if you don't want it.

s narration:
 In the book, I go on a few dates with Jordan. We're gonna skip all that.

Tom:
 I'd like to add another bit of pointless confusion that will make sense later. Let's everyone drive someone else's car.

Gatsby:
 Someone can take my coop.

Nick:
 I'm riding with Gatsby, I don't care which car.

Jordan:
 I'll take someone in Daisy's car.

Tom:
 I don't think Daisy said you could drive her car.

Daisy:
 Tom, why don't you take Jay's car?

Tom:
 Who's Jay?

Daisy:
 Gatsby.

Tom:
 Okay, I have never heard anyone call him that.

Nick:
 Look, if you're in your car, you're in the wrong car.

Nick:
 So, you've seen any good movies lately?

George:
 We just saw Woman Tied to Railroad Tracks 5. Pretty similar to 4.

Tom:
 Hello, room service? I'd like a bottle of your second most expensive champagne.

Gatsby:
 And I'd like your most expensive bottle.

Tom:
 Wow, walked right into that one.

Tom:
 I hear Gatsby didn't even fight in World War I.

Nick:
 Wait, why is he calling it that? [worried] Is there gonna be another big war?

Tom:
 Hi, Huckleberry Finn.

Huck:
 Hi, Tom Sawyer. You're Tom. I'm Huck. [to the camera] Everybody good?

Lois:
 Why the hell would Daddy buy the Brewery?

Brian:
 Well, there are children in the room. Watch your swearing.

Joe:
 I have to confiscate your license and you're gonna have to walk home.

Brian:
 But can't you at least just give me a ride?

Joe:
 No can do, Amigo.

Brian:
 Alright, I guess I'll just call an Uber.

Joe:
 Are you Brian?

Peter:
 You guys, what are you doing, watching TV? It's snowing.

Meg:
 Wow! It's so beautiful.

Peter:
 Isn't it? And you know what's a miracle, kids? Every single snowflake is exactly alike.

Chris:
 I don't think that's right.

Peter:
 No, it's true. Just like fingerprints.

Peter:
 Sledding was the second passion of Christ.

Jesus:
 Eat this, for this, is my dust.

Stewie:
 [to Susie] My sled has Dora on it because my parents got it at a yard sale. It ... It's still for boys though. She's about language acquisition, not gender.

Cleveland:
 You serious all this white stuff used to be water? Mmm, my word.

Brian:
 I've been crashing office Christmas parties for the free booze and the drunk women, who don't want to spend the holiday alone.

Stewie:
 Oh, so you're a Christmas party creep, just like the fat man is a pool party creep.

Peter:
 Now Chris, you're getting older, so it's time for you to learn the classic pool party game, Talk to someone's wife in a bikini until they cover up uncomfortably. [Peter talks to Bonnie and stares at her] So, Bonnie. How are things going?

Bonnie:
 Oh, things are fine. Been kind of busy lately, what with Susie starting to... [covers up]

Peter:
 Okay, bye. [Peter leaves] Man, that was like two seconds.

Quagmire:
 Hey, Peter. Hey, what have you been watching on TV lately?

Peter:
 Oh, you know, this and that. There's this show called "Shipping Wars" and it's kind of...

Quagmire:
 Okay, bye.

Chris:
 Dad, look! Santa's here! [gestures to a Mall Santa] I wanna sit on his lap.

Peter:
 Jeez, Chris, come on. You're in high school.

Chris:
 I'm gonna ask for a family trampoline.

Peter:
 Holy crap! Get your ass up there!

Cleveland:
 Wow, so that was San Francisco.

Joe:
 I didn't realize how hilly it was gonna be there.

Peter:
 Joke's on him. I farted just before he kicked us out.

Quagmire:
 Aaah! Oh, God!

Cleveland:
 Oh my God! Those guys in first class have guns!

Peter:
 Cleveland, just be happy with what you have. Don't envy people.

Peter:
 Uh, listen, Gronk, um, it's getting kind of late. Don't you think maybe it's time to call it a night?

Rob Gronkowski:
 Yeah, sure. Hey, have you ever seen a spikenard explode?

Peter:
 A what? A spikenard? Is that something on the Internet? 'Cause I...

Peter:
 AHH! Damn it! What the hell?!

Rob Gronkowski:
 [laughs] Dude, relax. I was just kidding.

Peter:
 You were kidding about what? What was the joke?

Rob Gronkowski:
 This was! [he slaps Peter in his groin again]

Peter:
 Oh, damn it! You hit the seam!

Peter:
 You know what? You're a jerk, Gronk! That's it. I'm gonna rid of that bastard. Just like how I kicked the British folks out of America.

Peter:
 This tyranny shall not stand! For without liberty...

Peter:
 Ah, crap! He's even in the cutaways! [groans in pain] Just cut to commercial. I'm gonna squat here and hold onto this bench.

Peter:
 I didn't see that in the newsletter this month. Just a big article about how to tailgate a speeding fire truck to get places faster. [cutaway to Peter tailgating a fire truck] Wait til they get to the golf course and find out there's no fire.

Peter:
 Oh, my God! Our new neighbor is Gronk!

Lou Ferrigno:
 Hey, I'm your new mailman. A former star of The Incredible Hulk, Lou Ferrigno.

Peter:
 On any other day, that would be so exciting. Please give me my mail and go.

Brian:
 [In regards to the steroids] So how much do we use?

Stewie:
 It says that this is enough for a horse? So...how many bees are in a horse?

Brain:
 Well you can't fit a horse in this box so I'd just use the whole thing.

Stewie:
 [After a moment of contemplation] That make sense.

Brian:
 Hey look. That bee's trying to get our honey.

Stewie:
 Okay Mr. Bee. We'll give you the employee discount. I...

Stewie:
 ARRRGH!

Brian:
 Holy crap! That thing just lifted a whole jar of honey! Do you think it's one of our steroid bees?

Stewie:
 Well, this one is wearing a hoodie as a shirt so...yeah. I'd say this is ours.

Brian:
 Stewie, I have a bad feeling about ... OH GOD! It just ate the other bee!

Stewie:
 [Worried] Okay. So some of the bees had a bad reaction to the ... Oh crap.

Stewie:
 Oh, my God! BRIAN, RUN!!!

Brian:
 What the hell are we supposed to do? We're surrounded.

Stewie:
 Hang on, I got this. [texting] Meg, come outside. We have Pinkberry.

Meg:
 Aah! Ow, ow, ow! Stop! Stop it!

Stewie:
 All right, they're distracted. Let's go! [he and Brian get out of the car and run to the back of the house] Quick, we just have to get rid of the queen. She's in the hive.

Brian:
 What's that gonna do?

Stewie:
 The bees instinctively stay with the queen. So if she's gone, they'll follow her.

Brian:
 Okay, great. But how are we gonna do it?

Meg:
 I said damn, what a wild couple of days. Anyways, sup with you guys?

Chris:
 Sorry amigo, not interested.

Lois:
 I'm gonna go take a shower, so I can blow my nose into my hands. [crashes into a wall] Ow! Damn it! I hate this house.

Peter:
 Morning, honey.

Lois:
 Go to Hell!

Brian:
 Ugh, this is gonna suck. 80% of these acts are either air guitar or girls dancing to songs from Frozen.

Lois:
 I'm glad you finally agreed to have the cataract surgery, Daddy.

Carter:
 I wish I hadn't. I can't see anything now. This is terrible.

Lois:
 Well, that... That's why the whole family came to support you.

Carter:
 Oh, really? Oh, wow. That's so kind. Who's there?

Lois:
 Oh, uh, ... Well, as you know. I'm here.

Carter:
 Who else?

Lois:
 Uh, Stewie and Brian.

Brian:
 Hey, hope you feel better soon.

Carter:
 That doesn't sound like the whole family.

Lois:
 [imitating Peter] Hey, hope those eyes get better soon, Pop. It's me, Peter. Shipoopi.

Carter:
 Oh, thanks for coming, Peter.

Lois:
 [mimicking Chris] I'm here too, Grandpa. [as herself] And, uh, and Meg went down to ... To put money in the meter.

Carter:
 Ah, I don't care.

Carter:
 Holy crap, it's Jessica Chastain!

Tom:
 Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker. Coming up is tonight's second story.

Brian:
 What's wrong with you?

Stewie:
 It's my back. It's killing me.

Brian:
 Yeah, I'm not falling for that hot oil massage bit again.

Stewie:
 No, this time it's not a bit. I'm in so much pain. I must have jacked it up, playing sports and not trying to dance like Beyoncé.

Al Harrington:
 Good afternoon and welcome to today's auction. I'm Al Harrington of Al Harrington's Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm-Flailing Tubman Warehouse and Emporium. Due to the presence of black mold, discarded half-eaten turkey legs, and an undulating rat king that no one dares approach, I have devised to move these proceedings along as quickly as possible.

Joe:
 Sorry I'm late. The pantry down at the station needed new shelf paper.

Quagmire:
 That's what they got you doing down there?

Joe:
 Well, that, and I'm also in charge of the office gerbil. And let me tell you, Lieutenant Nibbles is quite a handful. He'll only eat real cheese. Not processed.

Cleveland:
 You buy special cheese for a gerbil?

Joe:
 Yeah, I have to. He outranks me.

Joe:
 It may not sound exciting, but I play an important role. I go through all the body cam footage and take out all the parts where the cops go pee-pee.

Cleveland:
 So, you're just erasing cop wieners all day?

Joe:
 Eh, not erasing. Sort of cutting them together into a funny montage, we watch on birthdays.

Peter:
 Run like a man, you get a suit.

Father:
 Next up, our fantasy weekend for two at Fenway Park.

Peter:
 Oh, man. This is it.

Father:
 And the winner is ... Peter Griffin!

Peter:
 Holy crap, I won!

Brian:
 Wow, good for you.

Meg:
 Congratulations.

Chris:
 I LIKE IT WHEN PEOPLE SAY YOUR NAME OUT LOUD!

Airport Security Guard:
 Sir, you're not allowed to be on the carousel.

Peter:
 Well then, maybe you shouldn't have named it such a fun word.

Joe:
 I've got that murdered jogger's Discman you wanted last week. Still bloody.

Meg:
 Mom, you're going to Boston? I didn't even think you liked baseball.

Lois:
 Oh, I'm not going for baseball. I'm going shopping, to the hotel spa, and two days away from you life-sucking turds.

Meg:
 Okay, now you heard Mom say I'm in charge. So, I just wanna lay a few ground rules.

Stewie:
 Yep.

Meg:
 I promise we're gonna have fun, but there will be a schedule.

Stewie:
 Uh-huh.

Meg:
 Just to keep everything running smoothly.

Stewie:
 Sure, gotta have boundaries.

Meg:
 And I may assign a chore or two.

Stewie:
 Sounds great, Meg.

Meg:
 Because it's more fun when everyone pitches in.

Stewie:
 Hey, by the way.

Meg:
 AAAAAAAAH!

Stewie:
 I'm gonna flush your retainer down the toilet.

Lois:
 Alright Peter, I'm gonna go. You wanna hand me some cash in front of the other men, so you feel powerful?

Peter:
 Instead, why don't you just take my Minions Discover card?

Brian:
 We could repurpose my one-act farce.

Chris:
 Or we could write something fresh.

Principal Shepherd:
 [over the intercom] Good morning, students. Today at 3:30, James Wood High will be hosting a cross-country meet, which also happens to be where Lorraine has threatened to take my children. Across the country. And here's today's Tuesday trivia question. Does this sound like yelling? Because apparently, this sounds to some people like yelling.

Jock:
 Well, well. If it isn't Meg Griffin.

Meg:
 Leave me alone, you guys.

Jock:
 Relax, we're taking the day off from bullying.

Meg:
 Oh, thank God. [opens her locker and her face gets burned off] Very funny. Who put the ark of the covenant in here?

Jock:
 Meg is so stupid. She couldn't handle the glory of God's love.

Principal Shepherd:
 I just listened to two hours of butt-dialed sex between my wife and the ADT alarm guy.

Meg:
 Why didn't you just hang up?

Principal Shepherd:
 Because I miss the sound of her voice. [bursts into tears]

Lady:
 [over the intercom] Principal Shepherd, your wife is on the line. She says, "Ugh! Ugh! Oh, God! Harder!"

Stewie:
 Please rub the H and the C off all the knobs, so people won't know what's going on. I want the first 4 minutes of every shower to be confusion and anger.

School Board Guy:
 I know a number of our students have felt [mimicking students] traumatized by the events of this week [normal] and we take those concerns very seriously.

Peter:
 Ah, the water park. Happy anniversary, Lois.

Peter:
 Uh, where's the slide?

Peter:
 Wow! Lemons! Oranges! Cherries! So juicy!

Peter:
 I don't think that was a Starburst. I think that may have just been acid.

Peter:
 Is it also acid?

Park Worker:
 My friend, I'm an adult who works at a water park. If I give you something, it's acid.

Isabella:
 My top came off on the slide. I think I may have seen ... you put it in your shorts.

Chris:
 Okay, well here's my shorts. [Chris takes off his shorts, which are full of bikini tops] Just fish out the one that's yours.

Chris:
 I saw Lady and the Tramp, so I asked if we could eat spaghetti in the alley, but they said no 'cause of all the homeless masturbation.

Isabella:
 Aw, I love that movie.

Lois:
 Are you sure you wanna date a girl who's had so much experience?

Chris:
 What do you mean?

Lois:
 Like, maybe she's got some city miles on here.

Stewie:
 Not to mention a couple of blowouts. [chuckles] Hey, Bri.

Brian:
 Yup, I heard you.

Brian:
 Look, I can see why you're concerned that Chris' girlfriend has kids, but, he's happy and she seems like she's into him. Plus she's ... [bites lips] she's hot.

Lois:
 [bites her lip] Yeah, she is.

Peter:
 [lips covered in blood] I bit my lip off.

Chris:
 [sigh] Go away, Mr. Herbert.

Herbert:
 It's not me. I'm in your closet.

Peter:
 Chris, meet Orville Redenbacher and his son. Watch.

Peter:
 Lois, is the president stronger than a king-- [sees Larry and Lois] WHAT THE HELL?!

Lois:
 Peter! Look, calm down. We're just friends, he's just giving me a friendly massage.

Peter:
 A friendly massage?!

Lois:
 Yeah, and what do you care? When is the last time, you did anything nice for me?

Peter:
 I ate that gross pasta you made!

Larry:
 I might as well just tell you, Peter. I'm in love with Lois. I knew it, the moment we kissed.

Peter:
 Kissed?! [to Lois] Is that true?

Lois:
 Yes, Peter. But, I--

Peter:
 YOU SON OF A BITCH!!! [Peter begins to fight Larry]

Peter:
 Family Guy has been around since 1999 and whenever it's time for the Emmys, they don't give us one. I'm sick of it.

Lois:
 Well, I'm not making another episode with The Simpsons. What did that give us? I'll tell you what it got us. More ink for The Simpsons.

Peter:
 Yeah. [reads newspapers] Simpsons plays down to competition, Simpsons step into the sewer, shame on you, Simpsons. [jealous] Those lucky bastards.

Lois:
 [warning Peter as he shuts the door] Forget the freakin' Emmy. If you touch her ass, I'm...

Stewie:
 I think gender reassignment surgery is very brave and the fat man should win some kind of award for it.

Brian:
 [correcting him] The fat woman.

Stewie:
 He hasn't chopped it off yet.

Brian:
 That doesn't matter. Peter already identifies as a woman.

Stewie:
 And on Karaoke night, I identify as George Michael. That doesn't mean it's true.

Tricia Takanawa:
 Daddies, I'm standing here, delivering my line with more emotion and less of a monotone than the actual Lily on Modern Family.

Peter:
 You guys aren't supporting my choice?

Quagmire:
 Well, what do you expect, Peter, I mean a sex change operation? Why are you doing this?

Peter:
 I'll tell you why I'm doing all of this. For me. M E. M E. I'm doing it for Emm-my.

Peter:
 Huh, samurai or geishas ... Which one am I? I'll just wait 'til somebody else goes in. [two Asian people with unidentifiable genders go into both bathrooms] Well, that wasn't helpful.

Anthropologie Store Owner:
 Sir, sir, there's nothing possibly imagined, that's strange or useless enough, that we don't have it here at Anthropologie.

Peter:
 I know the one thing you don't have: black customers.

Peter:
 Deuce.

Peter:
 Look, this-- this right here-- is exactly why I've been avoiding you. I knew you'd embarrass me in front of Stryker.

Quagmire:
 Who cares? He's just some dude.

Peter:
 He's not just some dude. He happens to be the cool friend I've ever had!

Joe:
 What are you talking about? We're cool.

Peter:
 You are not cool.

Joe:
 Oh, yeah? Well, then why did those teenagers on the way in say, "Cool wheelchair, dick"?

Quagmire:
 Hey, look, Peter if you're so embarrassed by us and you think we're losers, well, then we don't want to hang out with you, either!

Peter:
 Good! Who needs you bums? I got Stryker!

Quagmire:
 Oh, yeah? Well, I hope you two are happy together, you jerk!

TV Announcer:
 We now return to The Last Man on Earth, plus these other 16 people, with more showing up every day.

Peter:
 Aw, no way they'll pull this off. A show with just one character and an unlimited number of other characters?

Peter:
 FYI, my mom's not picking me up for a long time, because... [performs a drum roll] She's dead!

Lois:
 Peter, come down here

Peter:
 [In goat voice], Lois is mad, go to the clam

Lois:
 I saw you Peter

Peter:
 [In goat voice], go back

Peter:
 Oh, boy. Amber alert. Stewie was last seen with a goat in a 98 Toyota Tercel, heading north on I-95.

Carter:
 How do you turn those off, by the way?

Natalia:
 Next book, Everybody Poops... Blood.

Peter:
 Give me two of those round balls of butter and a bread stick. You'll see where I'm heading with this. Okay, look, look, look. [makes a phallic shape with the food] Here's what you want. [bites the breadstick in half] Here's what you got.

Natalia:
 No kissing. Under bed!

Carter:
 You there!

Cleveland:
 Me?

Carter:
 No, the other black guy in shorts. Yes, you!

Cleveland:
 I also have a fat, weird son. Would you like a hug?

Peter:
 Yes, birthdays are the hardest.

Chris:
 Grandpa only gave me a dollar?

Lois:
 Chris, you write him a thank you note. That will is still wide open.

Thru Guy:
 Welcome to McBurgertown, what can I get for you today?

Peter:
 Hmm, what's the easiest thing to eat in the car? I'll have the huevos rancheros and an orange soda without the cap.

Tom Tucker:
 What do we have, ... up, too young.

Peter:
 Hi there, it's me, Peter. You know, when it comes to making dreams come alive, there used to be nothing like the movies. So we thought it would be fun to ask a few visionary Hollywood directors to create his...let's be honest, HIS, own unique version of the same Family Guy story, "Peter Gets Fired". Of the countless directors we contacted, three did not say "no" immediately.

Brian:
 Hello. As you all know, I'm Brian Griffin.

Quagmire:
 [offscreen] Boo. Boo, Brian Griffin. Boo.

Brian:
 I want to read a few words.

Quagmire:
 Boo. Liar. Boo, Brian Griffin. Boo.

Brian:
 Anyway, I want to...

Quagmire:
 [still cuts off Brian] Boo. Apologize somewhere else. Boo. Boo, Brian, boo.

Brian:
 Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to apologize...

Offended Man:
 Why did you say "ladies" first? That's sexist!

Brian:
 It's just... It's just a standard greeting. Let... Let me start over. Gentlemen and ladies...

Offended Woman:
 Ooh, says the man!

Brian:
 Okay, sorry, I... I, um. Humans in the audience...

Offended Basketball:
 I identify as a basketball!

Brian:
 Humans and basketballs...

Offended Parrot:
 I'm a parrot who mimics, but doesn't comprehend them!

Brian:
 Humans, basketballs, talking parrots, and-and whatever else is out there...

Offended Woman:
 "Whatever"? It's whoever.

Other Offended Woman:
 Actually, it's whomever.

Brian:
 All right, all right, just-just calm down, okay?

Offended Woman:
 Now you're tone policing us!

Offended Man:
 That makes me uncomfortable! Anything that makes me uncomfortable in 2017 should be illegal!

Brian:
 [when no one lets him apologize] You know what? [crumples up and throws his apology away] Fuck you! [everyone gasps in horror] I'm not a racist, all right? I just told a bad joke. There's a huge difference. But nobody on the internet ever takes the time to ask themselves "Is this worth freaking out over?", Or "Are there bigger problems in this world than this tweet?". Well, I assure you there are! And just for the record, I love black people! I've watched tons of black porn! So what do you all want from me? Huh? Do you wanna ruin my life? Well, congratulations, you did it! Everybody hates me! I can't leave the house without getting harassed, no one will hire me...

Stewie:
 [from inside the house; offscreen] That was a problem before.

Brian:
 I can't turn on my phone without strangers telling me to kill myself, or that they're gonna kill my family! LEAVE ME ALONE! I'M THE LIBERAL DOUCHEBAG, NOT YOU! I'VE KISSED A TRANSSEXUAL BEFORE! HOW MANY OF YOU CAN SAY THAT?! WHERE'S MY FUCKING MEDAL?! I AM SO FAR LEFT, I'M SPINNING IN CIRCLES, YOU SHITHEADS! INSTEAD OF KILLING MYSELF, I SHOULD KILL ALL OF YOU!

Mob Man:
 I'd like to see you try.

Brian:
 Ow! Geez... [he returns to the house, with all the people clamoring and throwing stuff] Well, we started the dialogue.

Lois:
 You screamed: "black porn" at the top of your lungs in front of women and children.

Peter:
 You got DirecTV?

Putin:
 We have Time Warner.

Peter:
 You got HBO?

Putin:
 We have Starz.

Peter:
 You got ESPN?

Putin:
 We have Fox Sports 1.

Peter:
 Does that come in HD?

Putin:
 420P.

Peter:
 You got--?

Putin:
 Everything you say, I say something a little bit worse.

Peter:
 You got Simpsons?

Putin:
 We have Family Guy.

Stewie:
 I'm coming over.

Brian:
 Hey, listen, you...you don't think...You don't think you could snag a couple of rolls of toilet paper, could you? [silence is heard on Stewie's end] Stewie?

Stewie:
 [over the phone] I'm here. I just wanted you to have to sit with those words for a minute.

Lois:
 [offscreen] Kids, dinner's ready.

Meg:
 [mimicking Lois] Dinner's ready. [normal] Shut up.

Peter:
 So, what are you kids doing at school?

Meg:
 I got in trouble for saying something insensitive to trans kids.

Lois:
 What'd you say?

Meg:
 Well, a few of them started this a capella group, and they're all kind of chubby, so I said, you guys should call yourselves, The Trans-Fats.

Peter:
 Ah! Son of a bitch! What was that?

Lois:
 I don't know. Someone must have messed something up.

Peter:
 Hey, you wanna see where I was sitting, when you were born?

Peter:
 You were already drinking tonight, weren't ya?

Meg:
 [snickers] A little.

Peter:
 Well, I can't talk to a drunk person if I'm sober.

Meg:
 What can I say? I'm just full of surprises, like the end of The Usual Suspects

Brian:
 I hate the guy, but he is good.

Lois:
 [enters Brian's shared hospital room] Oh my God Brian, are you okay?

Brian:
 Yeah, I'm fine.

Lois:
 [to Brian's roommate] Annie, are you okay? So Annie are you okay? Are you okay Annie?

Chris:
 What happened to her?

Lois:
 She was hit by...uh, she was struck by a smooth criminal.

Chris:
 That was fun mom. We don't get to do a lot of that kind of stuff together.

Lois:
 And Meg, I hope you learned your lesson about drinking.

Meg:
 Yeah. I think I'd rather live my life as a loser than feel bad once in a while.

Lois:
 Well, I hope you know that you're our loser.

Meg:
 Thanks, Mom.

Lois:
 You know, Chris. You and your stillborn brother, Tomas were named after Christmas.

Lois:
 First, I need you to take down last year's Christmas lights and put up this year's Christmas lights.

Peter:
 Aw, now I wanna be on that side. [Peter goes to the other side, making the water go back into the tub] Well, that didn't work.

Peter:
 Is this how Jonah Hill was made?

Peter:
 Oh, my God! I'm dead! How?!

Patrick Swazye:
 You died from a fire started by your MILF on a shelf.

Meg:
 What are you doing to Dad?

Peter:
 What? I'm going to the grocery store.

Chris:
 I can't tell if they have a really good marriage or a really bad one.

Stewie:
 [chuckles] Yeah, you're right. I bet he is on his period, whatever that means... [covers his ears, as though Rupert is telling him what it means] LA LA LA LA! STOP STOP STOP! GROSS GROSS GROSS! EW EW EW! NO NO NO! EW!

Peter:
 A loaf of bread, a container of milk, and a stick of butter. A loaf of milk, a container of bread, and a Joe Dirt DVD. A Joe Dirt DVD, Scarlett Johansson, and treasure from a fish tank.

Peter:
 Oh, Mr. Boo Berry! I'm your biggest fan!

Boo Berry:
 You're not the one threatening me on Facebook, are you?

Peter:
 No! No. No, not... not you. Not you.

Peter:
 This is the best thing to happen to me since I became a wise-cracking, fourth-wall-breaking superhero! [cutaway to Peter as Deadpool] Call me Redstool. The treatment didn't give me powers, but it did spread cancer to my anus.

Stewie:
 Bear killing bastard!

Brian:
 Oh my God, Stewie, I am so sorry. I was drunk. It was an accident. I must have thought he was a chew toy.

Stewie:
 So? If you were driving drunk and ran him over, would you still go to jail? Yes! You killed him!

Brian:
 Let me make it up to you, please. How about you kill something I love?

Stewie:
 How about I do that?

Stewie:
 See? I guess we do know each other a bit.

Pritchfield:
 You seem like a very lonely little boy.

Stewie:
 [in tears] Oh my God, I am! I'm so lonely! [cries] You can see inside my soul!

Watson:
 Holmes, there's something I have to tell you. I'm getting...

Holmes:
 [cutting him off] I deduce, Watson, that you're getting married!

Watson:
 I just said that.

Holmes:
 Yes, but I had deuced it first.

Watson:
 He's got a gun! Look out, Stew ... Holmes! God, this is gonna be so annoying.

Eric Dane:
 [reads Peter's hat] USS Nathan James?

Peter:
 Yes, sir. Boats, military, sir.

Eric Dane:
 The Nathan James is the fictitious ship on TNT's The Last Ship, starring Adam Baldwin and Jocko Sims.

Eric Dane:
 ...and Eric Dane.

Cleveland:
 Uh-oh.

Stewie:
 What a day! I asked Mrs. Watson if she had any kids of her own, and immediately she put me in a time-out.

Consuela:
 Ay dios mio!

Brian:
 Oh great, it’s one of them!

Stewie:
 Brian!

Brian:
 Stewie, adults are allowed to say racist things because of traffic.

Consuela:
 My ‘98 Toyota Corolla! We all have a ‘98 Toyota Corolla.

Mikey:
 ¿Qué?

Consuela:
 I was allowed to say racist things because of traffic.

Jerome:
 You guys would look after this place for me?

Peter:
 Of course, running a bar has always been my dream! Well, that, and waking up a rooster. [Cuts to Peter slowly sneaking up on a rooster sleeping on a fence] AARRRGH! [The rooster wakes up and falls off of the fence.] Enjoy the rest of your Saturday.

Carter:
 Damn it, we went to the wrong place.

Crowd Voiceover:
 Vick!

Crowd Voiceover:
 And Eli Manning!

Brian:
 I didn’t know that about you.

Eli Manning:
 Oh yeah, I’m a real idiot psychopath.

Closed Captioning:
 [On the bottom of the screen] This isn’t true, but Patriots fans write this show.

Cleveland:
 Great idea, Peter.

Dummy Peter:
 [In place of the real one] Thanks, guys! [Dummy Peter realizes he is fake.] Oh no, I left the real me in there!

Peter:
 Guys, it's working! He thinks I'm me!

Dummy Peter:
 [After Jerome beat up the real Peter.] Hello others, I am the father! Where is the mother, and what type of sex does she like to have?

Peter:
 For 60 years, Sunday has met God, Football, and Family Guy and later, to a lesser degree.

Tricia Takanawa:
 [in Ollie Williams's body] I'm standing here for some reason doing the weather in a giant black man's body. What kind of a Friday is this?

Ollie Williams:
 [in Tricia's body] FREAKY!

Tricia Takanawa:
 Back to you, Tom.

Herbert:
 [in Tom Tucker's body] This just in: all kids report to the blue van in the park at 3 pm for free popsicles!

Jerome:
 [in Ida's body] What the hell? Am I doing a Madea?

Ida:
 [in Jerome's body] Oh, Lord. This time, I'm gonna need a chainsaw!

Bruce:
 [in the Kool-Aid Man's body] Oh, no!

Aid Man:
 [in Bruce's body] OH YEAH!

Quagmire:
 [to the hamster, as he's begging it] Don't do it. Don't do what I was gonna do. [the hamster squeaks and lowers Quagmire down] No! No! You've perverted something beautiful!

Stewie:
 Brian, hurry!

Brian:
 Stewie, I'm in Chris' body. I'm dragging 230 pounds of lard up a ladder.

Chris:
 I'm 215, you liberal dickweed!

Peter:
 Hey, Chris.

Chris:
 Hey, four eyes.

Peter:
 What did you call me?

Chris:
 Oh, you're deaf, too?

Mayor West:
 [reading from the book of Just Jared] Death be the ultimate fail.

Hammer:
 Peter you're doing great as a millennial. The next thing is you gotta be on Fleek.

Peter:
 "On fleek"? Do people still say "on fleek"?

Hammer:
 No Peter, that's not what I meant. I want you on Fleek. This is Fleek.

Peter:
 Aww, can I ride him?

Hammer:
 Sure, Peter. Get on Fleek.

Peter:
 [Complies] Yay! [Peter and Fleek ride past a collection of various images] Our country's involvement in six different wars, but millennials think about this stuff!

Hammer:
 Remember, Peter. Never walk anywhere when you can ride something weird instead.

Peter:
 What's that? Sorry, I was too busy taking a selfie while shooting a Snapchat while periscoping that Snapchat while Instagramming latte art while Shazaming the Weeknd while streaming Master of None retweeting George Takei while saying, "This wins the Internet!" while still being #sooobored. Hammer? Hammer? Come on, man. Don't make me look up from my phone.

Hammer:
 [Having been hit by a bus] Peter, it's too late. Listen. I've got this idea for a business, and I want you to have it. It's artisanal...artisanal...

Peter:
 Artisanal what? Is it pretzels? Is it artisanal pretzels? Has that been done? Does anyone know if artisanal pretzels are a thing? It seems so obvious, yet I don't think I've ever seen them. I better do millennial CPR! One! Ugh, whatever. Two! Ugh, whatever. Three! Ugh, I'm gonna let my parents take care of this.

Lois:
 Peter, why is he naked in there?

Peter:
 It's an environmental statement. Lois, please stop looking at my dead friend's dong.

Lois:
 Listen! I made breakfast and drove, so if there's a dead dog, I'm gonna look at it!

TV announcer:
 And now back to Marvel's The Offenders.

Bill Cosby:
 (dressed as Nick Fury) Good morning, ya see. I gathered you all here together: Kevin Spacey, Roman Polanski- hey, hey, hey- Woody Allen, Steven Seagal, Matt Lauer, with the pudding pop... [Lauer poses at Cosby] Brett Ratner, and you, lesser-known offender James Toback.

Harvey Weinstein:
 [in a Hulk-like voice, lumbering in wearing a barely-covering bathrobe] Don't forget me! Harvey shower.

Woody Allen:
 Uh, I...is Matt Damon coming?

Bill Cosby:
 No, but he knows about all of us. He's... very aware of what's goin' on here, ya see.

Quagmire:
 I can't believe it. This is horrible. What am I gonna do?

Peter:
 If anything were to happen to me, Lois, I'll miss you more than Life...the cereal, but not the board game which I quite enjoy.

Peter:
 And Meg, I'm sorry I'll never get a chance to walk you down the aisle...at Costco to furnish your sad, single-lady apartment.

Meg:
 [sarcastically] Thanks, Dad.

Peter:
 And Stewie, it kills me that I'll never see you become a man...-loving twink.

Stewie:
 Is anyone gonna stop him?

Peter:
 And Chris, whenever you're feeling defeated, I want you to always reach for the Stars...-ky and Hutch DVD that fell behind the entertainment center. Sorry, you were the last one.

Brian:
 What about me?

Peter:
 You're a dog.

Peter:
 Wha..What's going on?

Lois:
 Peter, enough is enough, that couch is coming off. We're sick of your shenanigans.

Peter:
 [grunts] How dare you?! I work my ass off to bring home the bacon for this family, And all you can say is, "We don't want bacon, we want actual money!" Well, I don't have money, I spent it all on bacon!

Lois:
 Peter, put yourself in our shoes.

Peter:
 I can't! My feet swelled up too much from all the bacon. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to sleep on the couch on the couch.

Peter:
 Chris, give me a hand with this. Alright, you ready? All right, 1..2..3.

Chris:
 [grunting]

Peter:
 Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.

Chris:
 Okay, all right.

Peter:
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. stop, stop.

Chris:
 What? What?

Peter:
 No, no, no, no, no. Twist it.

Chris:
 What? I am.

Peter:
 Just look down, all right? Just--just look at me, look what I'm doing. All right, see the way I'm twisting?

Peter:
 No, no, no, no, no.

Chris:
 Wait, what?

Peter:
 You know what? All right, just--hang--just put-put it down. put it down. Just drop it, drop it.

Chris:
 Alright, alright!

Peter:
 All right, let's...Let's just hang on and figure this out. Okay. I-I got it. I know what we're gonna...Okay, okay, y--you--we--here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna cushions off, unscrew the legs, take the mattress out, and this whole thing's gonna be a lot simpler. It's easier than we're making it. [grunting] This isn't working. You know what? Just give me a push.

Peter:
 Thank you, God!

God:
 Bless you, my pornography fan.

Jess:
 Tell me about it. He called me a dick earlier. [slides one of her cups to Brian] I'm Jess.

Brian:
 Thanks! I'm Brian. Well Jess, bottoms up!

Jess:
 If you're lucky.

Brian:
 So this place... ah, worse than Syria, don't you think?

Jess:
 Yes! Everything about it is awful: the people, the music... [say it with Brian] if you can call it music.

Brian:
 Oh my God, we were grumpy and bitter at the same time!

Jess:
 [giggles] I like you, Brian! You say what's on your mind.

Brian:
 Hey, life's too short, right?

Brian:
 Oh, my God. Somebody call 911! ["9-1-1" series ad pops up] Damn it, Fox! That's not an invitation to ruin our moment to expand your media empire! ["Empire" ad pops up, sighs] Son of Zorn. [fatal error message shows up] Ha.

Stewie:
 We may have taken this too far.

Brian:
 I'm warning you if you kill me, the internet's gonna freak out.

Lois:
 Oh, Meg. You have to babysit Stewie, Saturday.

Meg:
 Nope.

Lois:
 Okay. Chris, you have to do it.

Chris:
 What? That's not fair. I have a party to go to.

Lois:
 Sorry, Meg found pictures on your father's computer and she's blackmailing us. She can do what she wants until we get some dirt on her.

Peter:
 I didn't know it was supposed to be hard before I took the picture.

Peter:
 You lied to me! You said we were going to Baskin-Robbins!

Lois:
 I said we were going to bask in Robbin's glow.

Peter:
 [accusingly] You know what you did.

Lois:
 I do.

Stewie:
 This is a drone. Grown men, who have never had sexual relations fly them over to people's houses to try and… see something. I don't know.

Tony Robbins:
 All of you here are capable of greatness.

Bruce:
 [offscreen] Yaaaay!

Tony Robbins:
 But some will never achieve it.

Bruce:
 [offscreen] Oh no!

Peter:
 Your head is the size of a picnic watermelon.

Tony Robbins:
 Ha! I've been told that.

Peter:
 And you sound like you were lost at sea, and told not to drink seawater, but drank seawater.

Tony Robbins:
 Peter, I was once a lot like you. Unmotivated dangerously obese, always relying on cutaways…

Peter:
 You know, that reminds me of the time…

Tony Robbins:
 No, Peter! No more cutaways! Stay in the present!

Gilbert Gottfried:
 DOG WHISTLE! DOG WHISTLE! WHERE ARE YOU, DOG?!

Stewie:
 Wait a minute. This doesn't feel right. What button did you hit?

Brian:
 That one. The tiny button.

Stewie:
 Wait, did you press the tiny button or the button that says "tiny"?

Brian:
 I hit the button that says "tiny". You said, "hit the tiny button".

Stewie:
 Exactly! I didn't say "hit the big button that says 'tiny'"! I said, "hit the tiny button"! The one you pressed is gonna shrink us down to microscopic size!

Brian:
 Well, why would you make the tiny button big?

Stewie:
 I had to make it big enough to write "tiny" on it!

Lois:
 You bought Vine and shut it down.

Chris:
 I did what?

Kevin:
 More appetizer?

Meg:
 No thanks, cauliflower gives me the scoots.

Principal Shepherd:
 Parents of a failing student, say what?

Lois:
 No, Peter, wait!

Principal Shepherd:
 Nope. Too late. He said it. I'm marking it. [Principal Shepherd goes to a chalkboard, where he gives himself a tally mark] Didn't get The Wus. They're very smart. Asian. Maybe they didn't understand me. I don't know.

Chris:
 [rapping] Alexander Hamilton was white!

Lois:
 Why, Meg, don't you look pretty today?

Stewie:
 She's gonna ask you for something.

Chris:
 I can't believe I have to go to vocational school. Does this mean that I'm a failure?

Lois:
 No, sweetie. It means that we're failures.

Teacher:
 Alright, settle down, ya yuks. We got a new student, Chris Griffin. So, everyone gives him an Ayyy!

Students:
 Ayyy!

Teacher:
 Look at that. Your first day and you got all Ayyys!

Wife:
 [yawns] Did you wash your hands?

Husband:
 Yeah.

Peter:
 Alright, time for Bethany Frankel. America's favorite chattering pirate skeleton.

Meg:
 Dad! Dad, get off me! Get off me, Dad!

Meg:
 [telling her family about the Olympic team] I'm a bi...

Stewie:
 Knew it.

Meg:
 ...athlete.

Stewie:
 Didn't know it.

Stewie:
 [suspicious] What are you up to?

Lois:
 Peter, I need you to mow the lawn. It's out of control.

Peter:
 I can't mow the lawn, Lois. The Friends of Distinction are out there, Grazing in the Grass.

Donna:
 [offscreen] Cleveland? Are you okay in there? Cleveland!

Cleveland:
 What? Uh...yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Mmmm, that was a good toilet dream about my neighbor and his lawn.

Peter:
 Now, to start the mower, you grab this pull cord like so, and give it a nice hard yank.

Chris:
 Can I change my grip?

Peter:
 Wow, much better.

Chris:
 It's a more familiar motion.

Chris:
 Did you know Corey got recruited by ISIS? He disappeared, and now this guy is doing ISIS videos and they think it's Corey.

Corey:
 Assalamu alaikum, guys, this is Corey! Here to talk about making a dirty bomb with stuff you can find in your kitchen!

Chris:
 Well, he often said he wanted to explode all over me. He finally did.

Peter:
 [eulogizing Angela] I may have lost a boss, but Heaven has gained a princess...

Bert:
 Attention, everyone. Do not adjust your TV sets. We are an interracial couple.

Peter:
 Two sets of disappointed parents, right there.

Shelia:
 Now that Angela's no longer with us, we will be your new bosses.

Bert:
 We're splitting the job because one of the shareholder's favorite songs was "Ebony and Ivory".

Bert:
 Now some of you might find the idea of two bosses, unconventional, but...

Shelia:
 We.

Bert:
 Assure.

Shelia:
 You.

Bert:
 Nothing.

Shelia:
 Will.

Bert:
 Be.

Shelia:
 Different.

Joe:
 Hey, you guys ever check Zillow?

Quagmire:
 Joe, who don't you shut the...

Peter:
 Tell me more about this silly word.

Cleveland:
 You might have a g-g-g-g-disembodied spirit in your house!

Meg:
 Holy girl boner!

Stewie:
 Dad's working for the Trump White House?

Director:
 Uh, hey Stewie? Could we do that again? Maybe a little more energy?

Stewie:
 [sips coffee] Uh, no?

Director:
 I... I think we can use it.

Stewie:
 [sarcastic] Oh, hey. That's awesome.

Peter:
 Wow, The White House is great. There's no wonder you spend two days a week here.

Stewie:
 Post Raisin Bran: like Kellogg's, but worse!

Robot Brian:
 Whoa! Ass ahoy!

Cleveland:
 Joe, what are you eating your ice cream out of?

Joe:
 They ran out of those batting helmets, so they're serving it in athletic cups.

Peter:
 I'm using the ladies' room. How bad could it be? [goes into the ladies' room, a girlish scream is heard, and Peter exits] I saw a mouse.

Peter:
 [referring to Stewie's lyric in the Theme Song] I swear, he says the F word.

Quagmire:
 Here, rub this up and on the inside of your cheek

Quagmire and Courtney:
 Giggity!

Quagmire:
 Ahhh! Stop staying that!

Brian:
 For you kids out there, DVDs were plastic discs…

Stewie:
 I... I got this, Brian. Have you ever been at your grandmother's house, and you look at her weird old computer and there's like a crack on the side of it? That's DVDs.

Brian:
 From the moment we arrived, I've either been drunk or ejaculating.

Stewie:
 These are things you don't say to a baby.

Peter:
 Ugh. I can't believe you dragged me to The Flow. This is gonna suck.

Lois:
 Oh, knock it off. It's not gonna be that bad. Besides, I couldn't leave you at home. The last time I did that, the kids walked in on you looking at internet corn.

Brian:
 Peter, that's your 50th bag. What could possibly be in there?

Peter:
 Oh, have you not heard?

Stewie:
 Brian, no!

Brian:
 Wait a minute, didn't we destroy that?

Peter:
 I glued it. Surfin' Bird finds a way.

Peter:
 What's the big emergency? Why did everyone have to come in on Monday?

Bert:
 The internet pretty much only lets us fire white males, so if you're not a white male, you're safe.

Peter:
 So is Derek Jeter safe?

Umpire:
 Safe! He's half black!

Bert:
 Hey, there PG. Been a minute.

Peter:
 Hey, Ernie. Uh, I mean Bert! Bert, sorry.

Lois:
 I gotta say, Peter. I had reservations about this cruise, but you do seem more relaxed.

Peter:
 Hey, good thing I had reservations on this cruise, huh?

Lois:
 Go, Stewie! Ha, isn't this exciting?

Peter:
 Yeah, but I don't like little Kyle Kaepernick kneeling during the National Anthem.

Peter:
 Boo! Get on your feet!

Peter:
 Boo! Down in front!

Brian:
 It's a meaningless event. Like a bar mitzvah.

Rabbi:
 Today, you are a man.

Boy:
 Great! Can I drive?

Rabbi:
 No.

Boy:
 Can I vote?

Boy:
 Can I drink?

Boy:
 Can I have sex?

Boy:
 Can I cash the checks?

Rabbi:
 Yes!

Peter:
 Do you have oysters?

Waiter:
 We do not.

Peter:
 Ah, shucks.

Stewie:
 Hey, Brian, you don't have a metal detector on you, do you?

Peter:
 Okay, when I read your name, please respond with a "here". Griffin, Mac.

Meg:
 It's Meg.

Peter:
 Sorry, it looks like Mac. Griffin, Liam.

Lois:
 It's Lois.

Peter:
 Again, please respond with "here".

Peter:
 That woman looks exactly like me.

Lois:
 That's your reflection, Peter.

Peter:
 Oh ... I'm beautiful.

Quagmre:
 You! You son of a bitch! This is all your fault!

Peter:
 This is the story of the greatest trilogy ever told … The Mighty Ducks. It was a time of great nonsense,...

Meg:
 Dad, why don't you tell us how you and mom fell in love and got married?

Chris:
 And in go the earbuds.

Quagmire:
 I got a promotion at Blockbuster!

Peter:
 Gleonard Quagmire, that is fantastic news.

Quagmire:
 I know, right? Do you know how I always felt like I was stuck in second gear? Well, this is new gear!

Peter:
 It was senseless. We were in our clothes for God's sake. Everyone got wet. It was cold. You know, there were originally nine friends, but three of them died of pneumonia. I'm still haunted by Chad's shivering last words, "Don't let Monica get Botox."

Peter:
 Lois and I are stocking up for a very special anniversary evening and I'm not sure that a 5% discount was worth checking in here on Facebook. [Peter gets a notification] Ew, Meg. Don't "like" that!

Lois:
 We're having people over! I just got off the phone with my mom and all the Pewterschmidts are coming here for Thanksgiving.

Peter:
 I can't believe you invited the whole family. You know I hate big Thanksgiving.

Lois:
 Don't worry, Peter. It's gonna be fun and I can handle most of the prep, myself. I just need you to go to the market and get some extra napkins.

Peter:
 That's not so bad.

Lois:
 Oh, and pick up some wine for the adults.

Peter:
 I can do that.

Lois:
 And put the extra leaf on the dining room table.

Peter:
 FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!!!!!!!!!

Joe:
 Bonnie's sister is married to a real show-off.

Bonnie:
 Denise, Wendell, it's great to see you.

Joe:
 Wendell.

Wendell:
 Joseph.

Joe:
 It's just Joe, I think you know that.

Brian:
 Wow, okay, uh...Stewie. I think I know what happened. I can't tell you explicitly since we're owned by Disney, but let me just say that Santa made her "little mermaid Moana".

Meg:
 Dad, I'm going to ask you one question, and how you answer it will determine the rest of my life. Were you the Santa at this mall yesterday?

Peter:
 Now, Meg, I got a question for you: is there really a weight limit for the escalator, or did I just meet some mean kids?

Peter:
 So long, bitchy 2AM blanket pulls.

Joe:
 Ahhh, there we go.

Lois:
 [from the back of the police cruiser] Screw you, Peter.

Stewie:
 Look at this, Brian. Genderless baby announcement.

Brian:
 It's they.

Stewie:
 Good for they.

Joanna:
 I'm getting my friend a birthday card in Spanish... but he doesn't speak Spanish! [laughs]

Stewie:
 Oh-ho-ho-ho! He's not gonna know what it says! Oh, you're bad.

Mort:
 Go on! Scoot! Get out of here! Or I'll do the cliché pharmacy price check jokes.

Brian:
 You wouldn't dare.

Mort:
 [over the intercom] Yes, I need a price check on extra small condoms!

Joanna:
 [laughs] That's the last thing he'd wanna announce! [laughs] Oh, God!

Brian:
 How did you know what he was doing?

Stewie:
 I read his book. "There is no greater motivation than the destruction of an enemy, and my enemy is Brian Griffin. One day, I will convince him to cut off his balls, and that will be my greatest accomplishment." You said his books changed your life, but you didn't even read them. This is why you're nothing.

Lois:
 Peter, I don't want to have to ground you! You're my husband, and I just don't want you to lie to me!

Peter:
 I lie to you 'cause you treat me like a kid!

Lois:
 Act like a man, and I'll stop treating you like a kid.

Peter:
 Look like a kid, I'll start acting like a man.

Stewie:
 Fart joke.

Shifting Valet:
 Sir, you need to get ready for your lifetime achievement award ceremony.

Stewie:
 Thank you, shape-shifting valet.

Shifting Valet:
 Remember sir, I can be any shape you wish.

Stewie:
 Yeah, but you're already this so.

Peter:
 I love coming to the ballpark. Drunken Irish in front of a fishbowl of minorities. What could go wrong?

Chris:
 Meg's estrogen supplements?

Meg:
 I'll take that, thank you.

Stewie:
 Dad gave me a sip of beer. I'm gonna mention that to my teacher and it's gonna be a big problem.

Lois:
 Hey, Bonnie. Who's on first?

Bonnie:
 Who? The person's name or the pronoun?

Lois:
 Ha. And it goes on like this.

Joe:
 It's my day to shine.

Joe:
 Yeah. A handicapped person at the ballpark. Ramps, private escort, meet the team.

Guy:
 Is there a Joe Swanson?

Peter:
 Right here!

Peter:
 Meet me on that balcony.

Carter:
 Where am I gonna get another coach?

Homer:
 I'm on vacation!

Carter:
 Ah, darn. That would have been funny.

Priest:
 Now, the bride and groom would like to share a moment of silence to honor the family members who have passed. They may not be with us in person but they are with us in spirit.

Stewie:
 Poo-poo!

Brian:
 No! We do not touch poo-poo in this family! We do not touch poo-poo! No! Hands up! That's it. Now there are no bubbles later.

Stewie:
 Yes! Bubbles!

Brian:
 No bubbles. You lost the bubbles.

Brian:
 Maybe you can earn them back but as far as I'm concerned, you lost the bubbles. They're gone. They're probably gone.

Stewie:
 Yay! Bubbles!

Brian:
 [angry] WHAT?!

Brian:
 No. No. No.

Stewie:
 Brian, you did it!

Brian:
 OH, SHIT! SORRY! SHIT!

Brian:
 Wish me luck, Flat Stanley. (leaves in Stewie's time machine)

Flat Stanley:
 Or you could just call me "Stanley". Not make fun of my body.

Peter:
 Nothing like drive-time radio to remind me that I don't make enough to afford satellite radio.

Weenie:
 Hey! You're listening to WQHG 971 and we're Devin and Lawrence formerly known as Weenie and the Butt.

The Butt:
 That's Devin. Those nicknames no longer fly ever since several women came forth with allegations of sexual misconduct against each of us.

Brian:
 [trapped inside the kitchen] Is there food on the floor? I can clean it up!

Brian:
 [observes the party from the kitchen] Joe dropped a cracker! Joe dropped a cracker!

Peter:
 Okay, Meg. If this is you, what's your birthday?

Meg:
 March 23rd.

Peter:
 I have no idea if that's correct. Good day, sir.

Lois:
 Oh my God. When we evacuated, I think we forgot him.

Peter:
 It's okay, Lois. I left him chained up in the gully in the backyard.

Brian:
 Guys?...Guys?!

 see:
 "Movin' In (Principal Shepherd's Song)" at the Transcripts Wiki]

Principal Shepherd:
 Okay, Chris. While you make these announcements, I'm going to be massaging your shoulders, just so I can say in court that I do it to everyone.

Chris:
 God.

Principal Shepherd:
 Good.

Chris:
 Movement.

Principal Shepherd:
 Morning.

Chris:
 Anglebird.

Principal Shepherd:
 Everyone.

Chris:
 The stagnant cancer muting.

Principal Shepherd:
 The student council meeting.

Brian:
 Stewie, how can you afford an entire opera in your room?

Stewie:
 Oh boy. Brian's upset because someone has something he hasn't. Do you know what I'm getting for your birthday? The ability to be happy for other people.

Peter:
 Guys, I'm worried about the baby. He's hardly touched any of his birdseed. Are you sure we're shaking him enough?

Quagmire:
 God, the Clam sucks on Saturday mornings. It's all just weird foreign sports fans like those Pakistani cricket hooligans.

Joe:
 I'm for Karachi but I don't get a death wish about it.

Quagmire:
 Hey, look. A pair of working legs. Dibs on these!

Joe:
 What? Aw, come on, Quagmire!

Quagmire:
 Joe, I said "dibs".

Joe:
 No, no. You're right. You said "dibs".

Stewie:
 I hate this. When do I get my cookie? I want my cookie so I can go home.

Priest:
 Now please join me in silent prayer and as we settle into the silence, I remind you that in honor of Lent, today's coffee service will not include chewy Chips Ahoy.

Stewie:
 FUUUUUUUUCK!

Chris:
 Hey, Stewie said his first word, and it was a swear!

Peter:
 Well, this is unacceptable! We have to leave right now and go straight to breakfast! [Walks out of the church and enters the car] Unbelievable!

Caillou Narrator:
 Lois couldn't find the swearer. Nor could she remove the voice of the grating Caillou narrator from her head.

Lois:
 MAKE IT STOP!

Caillou Narrator:
 Not until you kill them all, Lois.

Lois:
 [accidentally wipes her eyes with the anti-bacterial wipes for the shopping carts] OW! IT'S THOSE ANTI-BACTERIAL WIPES FOR THE SHOPPIN' CARTS! IT'S BURNIN' MY EYES! FUUUUUUUUCK!

Stewie:
 It's time I got back out there again. I've had one beer my whole life! That's not normal!

Brian:
 Nothing about you is normal.

Stewie:
 I mean, I've already wasted a whole year of my life with him!

Brian:
 There's only been a year of your life.

Stewie:
 You know, all of your responses have been very similar, so you might want to nip that in the bud.

Peter:
 Some lady up the block is giving away all of her husband's stuff cuz he shot himself in the face.

Meg:
 Oh my God!

Stewie:
 I've seen that lady. He did the right thing.

Cleveland:
 Donna, they had a bullhorn! I don't know why but they had a bullhorn!

Donna:
 Cleveland! It's time for lunch!

Cleveland:
 What do I want? Sammich! When do I want it? Now! I ain't eatin' any leftover soup!

Lois:
 Bonnie just told me about the neatest thing. It's called a podcast. I guess it's like a radio show on your phone. Have you heard of these? Podcasts!

Meg:
 Yeah, mom. We know what podcasts are.

Lois:
 Huh. I guess these types of things take a while to reach the moms. I have to let Bonnie know.

Bonnie:
 Wow! Really?!

Peter:
 Since Willem Dafoe has more bones in his face than most people have in their entire body, he's perfect for carving cuz the angles are so sharp.

Cleveland:
 Hey, Donna. The tree's just regular.

Donna:
 Go to work, Cleveland!

Peter:
 Ah, the beach. So much to do. Unlimited possibilities. [notices a "No Alcohol" sign] There is nothing to do at the beach! Why did we come here?!

Peter:
 When I go back to school, all my greaser friends are gonna say "Tell me more! Tell me more!" and I'm gonna say you were a slut.

Peter:
 God, can't you believe that Trump hung himself in prison?

Lois:
 You can't bring a cat to church!

Peter:
 Why not? He's cat-olic!

Principal Shepherd:
 Everyone, I wanna thank you all for helping us decorate for the fall dance.

Meg:
 What's the name of this dance anyway?

Principal Shepherd:
 [annoyed laugh] I've been doing this a long time, Meg. The next thing out of my mouth. The theme is climate change. Dance like it's the end of the world. We're going to -

Meg:
 But how do we even decorate for that?

Principal Shepherd:
 [exasperated sigh] We're gonna pump the heat up to 92 and fill the gym up with 6 inches of water and then, you know, balloons, streamers, all that crap. So, thanks again and if anyone needs anything, just think. I'm hanging balloons. How could I possibly have a question?

Meg:
 What do we even - ?

Principal Shepherd:
 [extremely angry] MEG! [takes a deep breath] [calmly] Thanks guys.

Esther:
 So, I'm pretty sure Bobby and I are finally gonna do it after the dance.

Meg:
 [gasp] You're gonna have sex!?

Esther:
 I'm talking about our suicide pact.

Meg:
 [laughs] Oh my God. I was like, who is this girl?

Cleveland:
 I think maybe the show's over.

Peter:
 Lois, you're making this harder than it needs to be. Just get a former Batman and move on. I'm sure Val Kilmer could use the insurance.

Lois:
 Peter, we're not going to get a former Batman. That has been pitched every day since Adam West died and the response has been tepid at best.

Wild West:
 If you're looking for something rugged, something durable, something with an endless supply of gas and a tailgate made for dumping, then you must be looking for Meg Griffin. Meg might not be much to look at but with two different shaped airbags, Meg is one ride you won't mind taking out to the middle of nowhere and giving it all. She's road ready and road hard. Meg Griffin. Kindly leave your go-by and Roman numerics at the sound of the chow bell. [the sound of bell chimes]

Brian:
 Hey everyone, I have some news. I got a job writing for Quahog's top website, The Hog. Starting tomorrow, I'm an online journalist.

Peter:
 Isn't The Hog that stupid pop culture site with those lame quizzes telling you what character you are in a show?

Lois:
 Peter's mad cuz he always gets Barney Rubble.

Peter:
 If I was mad would I laugh like this? [laughs like Barney] I don't think so.

Employer:
 You're good at sexualizing children.

Brian:
 Is that a problem?

Employer:
 No, that's a big part of online journalism.

Lois:
 Well, dragging a bin full of decorations down the stairs while repeatedly yelling in front of my children means only one thing, it's Christmas time!

Peter:
 Yeah, Lois, I knew it was Christmas a week ago when the O in the Pornhub logo became a wreath.

Chris:
 Same.

Peter:
 [while bumping fists with Chris] Nice.

Lois:
 I'd like to finally get a present from the heart this year. Not just some defective clothing item Peter got on clearance at Marshall's.

Peter:
 [holds up a Rolling Stones knockoff shirt] But you love The Rolin Stones.

Stewie:
 [dressed as Cindy Lou Who] Santa Claus? Why are you taking our Christmas tree?

Lois:
 Why are you in pigtails and a little girl's nightgown?

Stewie:
 Okay, okay. Maybe we both forget what we saw.

Ernie:
 There's not left for me in this world. I lost my job. I lost my house. My wife left me for a bigger cock.

Peter:
 [looks towards the audience] Cocks are chickens!

Ernie:
 I'm better off dead.

Peter:
 Oh, that's sad. I agree. I guess that means I win, huh?

Holly:
 Hi, can I help you find something?

Stewie:
 What's she gonna do? This place doesn't even have a backroom. All the inventory is just out on the floor in ceiling-high library stacks.

Brian:
 Yep, we got it, Stewie. You're better than this place.

Stewie:
 Yeah, I know that. I'm better than in every place.

Holly:
 Looks like a 10 and a half.

Chris:
 They're perfect! I'll take them!

Holly:
 No, those aren't shoes.

Chris:
 [in a robot voice] Do not speak in that tone to the iron giant! [robot walks off] Must destroy shoebox city!

Peter:
 What's all this?

Joe:
 Oh, hey guys. Sadly my Uncle Ray passed away last week but he left me his vintage sports car.

Peter:
 Joe, that's amazing that your uncle died! But I'm sorry to hear about the car.

Lois:
 Chris, you've hardly touched your food.

Chris:
 Mom, are you a scientist?

Lois:
 No?

Chris:
 Then quit putting me under a damn microscope!

Terminator Peter:
 This isn't Big Mouth. You aren't gonna see it.

Cleveland:
 That's how my mom died.

Cleveland:
 You're right, Joe. We are all armed. I have it in case people try to make America great again.

Lois:
 Woohoo! New Orleans! I can't wait to get up on the balcony and bust out the twins! Ha ha! Did you hear what I said, Meg? I said I can't wait to get up on the balcony and bust out the...

Meg:
 [unamused] Yeah, I heard you.

Stewie:
 Feels a little humid.

Lois:
 Alexa, what's in the news this morning?

Alexa:
 Here is your morning briefing: In Washington D.C., Congress has passed a measure to...

Lois:
 Alexa, skip to celebrity birthdays.

Alexa:
 Mario Lopez is 47 years old today.

Lois:
 No way! Someone should tell his face!

Lois:
 See you later, Alexa. You're my best friend.

Alexa:
 ...And you're... You're awesome, Lois.

Manager:
 I can assure you, we have a wonderful team of lesbians wearing all black for you to choose from.

Peter:
 [upset] No! I want Jerry!

Lois:
 Come on, Peter, it's just a haircut. Come on, get up. You're embarrassing me.

Peter:
 [lying on the floor] I'm not gonna! I hate you!

Lois:
 [annoyed] Come on, Peter. You're acting worse than the time Chris auditioned for Stanley Kubrick.

Lois:
 Peter, you have to get a haircut.

Peter:
 Lois, Jerry's dead. So I think I'm just gonna be a long-haired old guy from here on out.

Meg:
 I'm, like, not mad at his hair. Sorry, but, like, I would.

Brian:
 You would what? And with who?

Meg:
 Anything. With anybody. I don't give a horse's tomato.

Doug:
 Hey, Poopy Thumb!

Stewie:
 It was golden spicy brown mustard from my sandwich! How many times do I have to say it!?

Doug:
 [chuckles] Okay, no need to relitigate what four of our peers saw.

Peter:
 New shirt, Cleveland?

Cleveland:
 Donna saw an unflattering picture of me on Facebook and only lets me wear black now.

Peter:
 Hey, can somebody change the channel? I'll watch anything except these stupid home renovations shows.

Quagmire:
 What's wrong with them?

Peter:
 Besides their lack of Kermits? Lots of things.

Cleveland:
 Fidel Castro was there to throw out the first pitch. He was wearing the same outfit as always. Later, we would find out he had a fashion disease known as a chronic fatigue system. We would write more jokes about him but our dum-dum writers only know what he looks like.

Cleveland:
 In Cuba, we hated America so much that we copied everything they did and died trying to get there.

Cleveland:
 We tried to play but it was difficult because hurricane season was from February through January. Every time, a hurricane would sleep through, decimating the island, and causing hundreds of dollars worth of damage.

Stewie:
 Oh, look. Kylie's mom is out of rehab.

Lois:
 Oh my God! It's a kid!

Stewie:
 It's Doug! Nice hit, bitch! Oh, and Elsa's underwear! This day just keeps getting better.

Lois:
 Well, thank you all for coming. Can I get anyone something to drink?

s Dad:
 I'm fine but Doug's mother would probably like three martinis and then have unprotected sex with her boss at work.

s Mom:
 Doug's father would love a glass of warm tap water and never make more than $30,000 a year for the rest of his life.

s Dad:
 As a form of settlement, maybe this weekend, you can put together a tree house I don't wanna deal with.

Lois:
 If that's what I have to do to make things right, then Peter and my children will build your son's treehouse.

Stewie:
 Alright, guess now the four men awkwardly sit here, while my mom gives your mom a tour of the house that doesn't deserve one.

Lois:
 [offscreen] And this is a room adjacent to the room we were just in.

s Mom:
 [offscreen] Ooh. This is a fun house!

Lois:
 [in Marge Simpson's voice] Happy Halloween, kids.

Peter:
 I have to go do a dangerous speedball and become the least surprising death in Hollywood history.

Wild:
 It me! Borat! You know. From that picture, Borat. Ever seen it?

Meg:
 Yeah, that movie come out like 15 years ago.

Wild:
 Well, I've never heard of it but it was just about the funniest thing I've ever seen.

Chris:
 Dad, can I ask you something about girls?

Peter:
 Are you wearing a wire?

Chris:
 VHS? What do those letters stand for?

Peter:
 That information has been lost to victory.

Lois:
 Stewie, when I was over, visiting grandma and grandpa, humiliating myself to ask them to keep paying for your preschool, ...

Stewie:
 I know you don't understand me but I understand you.

Lois:
 [takes out a stuffed monkey toy]... I found Chi Chi! He's like your doll, Reuben.

Stewie:
 [to Rupert] I know. I know. I know. You called Joanna "Joanne" the other day. It happens.

Stewie:
 What's on your shoes?

Doug:
 Oh, these are called laces. I doubt you've ever heard of them, Mr. Velcro.

Stewie:
 I know about laces! I've just never seen black ones! Jeez, why are you always such a dick!?

Doug:
 It takes one to know one.

Stewie:
 Where did you learn that? That was great!

Peter:
 Giggity morning, everyone. Lois, can I see you in the other room for a second?

Peter:
 Alright!

Brian:
 [reading his birthday banner] Happy birthday, dog?

Peter:
 Sorry, I spaced on your name at the party store. Have a good one, Brent.|

Peter:
 I don't recall inviting Kevin but sure.

Brian:
 His name, you remember.

Chris:
 Hi, I'm a 15-year-old wild card and...

Gun Salesman:
 WELL, LET'S GET YOU A GUN, ALREADY!

Peter:
 Let me ask a salesperson for help like a complete beta.

Peter:
 Okay, Brian. What do you get for me?

Brian:
 Okay, birthday jokes. [reading one of his jokes] We may not be colleagues, but there's no one in your league.

Peter:
 Boy, that's a brick on the backboard. Chris, what do you got?

Chris:
 I drove the family to Disneyland for vacation and when we got off the highway, the sign said "Disneyland Left" so we drove back home.

Peter:
 Chris, that's going in the show. See that, Brian? Don't be afraid to pull our heartstrings.

Miss Tammy:
 Children, please continue the independent day, while I go see if I just sneezed my tampon out.

Red Wiener:
 Say, can we go to the next scene with one of the cinematic sideways wipes they used to do in the '30s?

Mac:
 Eh, I don't know. I did a sideways wipe this morning. I don't recommend it.

Meg:
 Sweet. Tree lightning. Guess that means it's showtime.

Peter:
 Wait...what is this?

Meg:
 Oh, nothing. Just my tradition of putting four dozen hard-boiled eggs in a Kroger bag and passing them out at the tree lightning.

Peter:
 Okay, we get it, Meg. You're dark and different. [whispering to Lois] Wow, Meg is dark and different.

Meg:
 Yeah, they call me "Meg the Egg" cuz of my big bag of eggs. I hope you guys don't start calling me that but you can if you want to.

Lois:
 Good morning, Peter. Hope you enjoyed sleeping in.

Peter:
 Oh, there's no sleeping in, when you're an alcoholic, Lois. You just never go to sleep.

Peter:
 I'm often self-centered, and confused about my words, and shellfish.

Lois:
 How dare you buy me something that suggests I need exercise?!

Peter:
 This is a loud way to say thank you.

Lois:
 I went to The Fancington's Academy for insufferable girls. Our mascot was a well-dressed woman who yells at valets.

Lois:
 Do people bring husbands to these things?

Brian:
 You're not thinking of going without them, are you?

Lois:
 Honestly, Brian. These girls come from old money so they can be pretty stuffy and judgmental.

Brian:
 Well, [kills a bird and eats it] ...I'm still available.

Quagmire:
 I read everything people leave on planes. I read The Da Vinci Code four times.

Peter:
 The year 2020 was a terrible year for the Corona Beer company so they had to sell off all their TV commercial hammocks.

Chris:
 The neighbor's sprinkler ruined whatever this is.

Peter:
 Not so fast, Chris. I don't give up that easily.

Chris:
 Good for you, Dad. Go knock on the neighbor's door and have a mildly uncomfortable conversation.

Peter:
 I give up.

Peter:
 Guys, great news. My uncle just died so we can use his HBO Max password until they cancel his credit card!

Peter:
 Let's start with Game of Thrones, which aired 8 seasons and was beloved by America for 6 and a half seasons.

Tom:
 For those of you who don't know what VR is, I will now attempt to explain it without the aid of a teleprompter. You put a computer on your face and it's like this whole world man, it's crazy. I dated a chick whose little brother had one. Just nuts.

Meg:
 Gentlemen, the going great is $20 a game over here. Who's got a pair of stones big enough to challenge The Mighty Meg?

Lois:
 Oh, good. Kids, you're just in time for breakfast.

Chris:
 No time, Mom. The girl I stalk has field hockey practice at 8:00! I love a red-cheeked barbarian.

Lois:
 How 'bout you, Meg?

Meg:
 Can't. I'm weirdly the girl he's stalking. God, help me. I love the attention.

Lois:
 Well, it's just you and me, Stewie. What should we do today?

Stewie:
 I don't know, maybe forget everything that just happened?

Stewie:
 [narration] Meet Alana Fitzgerald. How she got here is quite the tale and I'm here to tell it to you. I'm here to tell you all about Alana. And who am I? I'm Stewie, the talking baby from Family Guy. Do you not know that?

Chris:
 I'm home from camp!

Brian:
 Welcome, home!

Stewie:
 Meg's been wearing your clothes.

Brian:
 Slippery slides are a nightmare of unexpected bumps and mishaps.

Stewie:
 Are you sure? Cuz the multicultural kids on the box seem to be having fun.

Asian Kid:
 Hi!

Hispanic Kid:
 Hola!

Black Kid:
 I'm a real boy who was put here by a witch!

Preston:
 Peter, you'll be very happy to know I finished conducting my employee productivity evaluations. I used a system called the Determining Employee Advancement Duties Working Engagement Intelligence Gains Hourly Test or DEADWEIGHT. And my results have shown you to be the brewery's least productive employee. So, pack your bags.

Dan:
 Hey, guys. My first name is Dan, which is what you'll all call me. Now, who wants to watch Ratatouille?

Chris:
 I'm Quahog's #3 realtor. I wanted to sell that house to your folks but...You're in great hands with Gil.

Peter:
 Lois, I need $28,000.

Lois:
 For what?

Peter:
 I decided I wanna open a sushi restaurant.

Lois:
 What do you know about sushi?

Peter:
 I don't care about the sushi. I just wanna yell at customers when they walk in the door.

Peter:
 Inashamashe! Hajimimashtay!! Herecomesablackguuuy!!!

Tricia Takanawa:
 Mayor West, what do you plan to do if you win the lottery?

Mayor Adam West:
 Well, I'd finally splurge and buy myself one of those fancy four piece suits.

Mayor West:
 I'd like to join your country club. I assume that won't be a problem.

Tricia Takanawa:
 And how about you, Every Persian Guy in the World?

Every Persian Guy in the World:
 White BMW.

Lois:
 Peter, what's wrong?

Peter:
 It's, uh, nothin', I'm just gonna wait a minute. [pause] There's teenagers in skinny jeans out there.

Peter:
 What do you mean I'm broke? What about all that money I sent to the Gayman Islands? They did what with it? No I don't want it back!

Brian:
 Peter, this is idiotic! Your odds of winning are like a hundred million to one! Don't you know the lottery is just a tax on stupid people?!

Peter:
 Would you be saying that if the prize was a hundred and fifty bags of the neighbors' garbage?

Brian:
 But it's not!...I mean...I mean, Is it? It's...That's an unrealistic, unfair question!

Peter:
 Okay, this is it, you guys! They're gonna announce the winning lottery numbers! Time for the Griffin family to meet its destiny!

Lois:
 When we lose, I'm gettin' a divorce.

Peter:
 Understood.

Peter:
 Yes! We won the lottery! I'm gonna get me a penis butler!

Butler:
 [suddenly appearing] Sir...

Peter:
 Butle my penis! BUTLE IT!

Carter:
 [on phone] Didja blow all your money yet?

Lois:
 No, Daddy.

Carter:
 [on phone] Alright, call me when ya blow all your money, love ya, bye.

Lois:
 Peter, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?

Peter:
 I quit my job, Lois.

Lois:
 You what?

Peter:
 Yeah, we're rich now. I don't need to be working. Ah, you should've been there, Lois. I told Angela what she could do with that job, just like I always fantasized.

Peter:
 Angela I just want to thank you for several extremely pleasurable years working for this corporation. Uh, certain unexpected developments have created a situation where I am no longer in need of employment. Uh, I would be remiss, however, if I did not extend my gratitude to you for your unwavering fairness and belief in me, and there is a giant poo on your desk.

Lois:
 I can't believe it. We lost everything.

Chris:
 What do we do now?

Peter:
 Well, seems like our only hope is the lottery.

Peter:
 Holy shit, we won twice and we're right back here again.

Lois:
 We had $150 million, and we blew through it in a month.

Peter:
 Yeah, but on the bright side, if this hadn't happened, we never would've met Kyle.

Random Guy:
 Hey.

Peter:
 And that's not even Kyle.

Peter:
 I just bought a giant room filled with gold coins, and I'm going to dive into it like Scrooge McDuck.

Peter:
 AAAAGH! It's not a liquid! It's a great many pieces of solid matter that form a hard, floor-like surface! AAAAGGHH!

Tom Tucker:
 Our top story tonight, we continue to track the process of Hurricane Flozell. The National Weather Service has issued a severe hurricane advisory and is urging everyone to stay indoors for at least the next 36 hours.

Peter:
 NO! What happened?!

Lois:
 The wind must've knocked the satellite dish loose.

Peter:
 Aw, crap. And I was gonna watch G.I. José.

Chris:
 Look, Meg, I don't know what your problem is. I thought Dad's humming was pretty entertaining.

Meg:
 You know what? This is what I'm talking about. This is a perfect example. You're my brother. You're supposed to be on my side, and you're such a bastard to me.

Chris:
 HOW AM I A BASTARD?!!

Meg:
 Oh, you want the whole story?

Lois:
 Meg, please.

Meg:
 Not now, Mom.

Peter:
 [giggles] I think Brian's getting a little water in there.

Meg:
 Chris, you treat me like you hate me, and I don't know why. You say hurtful things to me constantly. Do you have any idea what that feels like? What if I said those things to you? What if I started calling you a fat, zitty loser, who has no friends and smells like an old woman who has birds for pets?

Peter:
 [giggles] Still drinkin'.

Meg:
 Is it too much to ask to be treated with a little decency from my brother? Maybe show me some kind of kindness by not jumping on the "Let's-Get-Meg" family bandwagon?

Peter:
 [disappointed] Aw.

Lois:
 Look, the bottom line here Meg is that you're just taking your own problems out on everyone else.

Meg:
 Oh, my problems? Oh, I see. Is this coming from my role-model mother? The shoplifter, the drug addict, the pornstar, the whore who let Gene Simmons and Bill Clinton go to town on her?

Lois:
 [scoffs] So what? A...all those things are behind me now. I'm a better person now because of those experiences.

Meg:
 Are you? Are you a better person?

Lois:
 What's your point, Meg?

Meg:
 My point is that with all the irresponsible, reckless, idiotic behavior in your past, that somehow, heh, somehow you have the nerve, the arrogance to consistently and ruthlessly point out my shortcomings.

Lois:
 Alright, well fine! Okay, I'm not the perfect mother; who is?

Meg:
 [chuckles] Not only are you not the perfect mother, you're the farthest thing from! From the moment you gave birth to me, I had to trust you. I had no choice. I needed you to protect me from the world to, to be my guide, to help me navigate the difficult, confusing, and vulnerable journey to becoming a person. You have done NONE of those things! You're my mother and you took a child's trust and smashed it into bits in a seventeen-year long mission to destroy something that you killed a long time ago! And honestly, when I turn eighteen, I...I don't know that I ever want to see you again!

Stewie [looking at his phone]:
 Oh, wow, everybody's already Tweeting "Stewie Just Said That".

Lois:
 Ugh, you're right. You're right, I'm a terrible mother! I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry, Meg! Can you, ever forgive me? Oh, God!

Meg:
 And you never let dad stir the paint anymore...whatever that means.

Peter:
 I didn't know you knew that, Meg, but I'm glad you brought it up.

Stewie:
 [referring to Meg] Oh God, is she gonna do me next?

Meg:
 You are completely selfish, and totally irresponsible as a father.

Peter:
 All right, I see what's going on here. You're in love with your old man.

Meg:
 You have no education, you have no interests, you just do whatever reckless thing you want to do, whenever you want to do it, without regard for anyone else. Oh, oh, oh, and when you're not terrorizing the community with your impulsive escapades, you're being a total jerk to your family! You shove your daughter's face in your ass and you fart on it!

Meg:
 God, if someone in the outside world could see the way you treat me, you would be in jail!

Meg:
 Oh, this is amusing to you? Well, see if you find this funny!

Peter:
 I like where this is going.

Meg:
 You're a fat, lazy, abusive, blue-collar, Irish-Catholic dad who drinks WAY too much, and barely makes enough to support his family! You've lived half your life, and you have nothing to show for it! Your only arguable accomplishments are your kids, and look at us! We're a disaster!

Stewie:
 Meg, watch it.

Meg:
 You're a total and complete embarrassment in every possible way! Take a good look at yourself Peter Griffin! You're a waste of a man!

Peter:
 Wait a second, these are criticisms! Hey Lois, tell her to knock it off!

Lois:
 Oh, and where the hell were you when she was laying into me?!

Peter:
 I was thinking about getting a fancy cane, maybe getting more attention from strangers.

Brian:
 I'm going to cut my ear to prevent World War II.

Brian:
 Lesbians... and deaf women... wear the same clothes...

Chris:
 You're a fucking bitch!

Meg:
 Yes. Yes, I am.

Meg:
 Have either of you guys been listening to me?! Do you both just have your heads up your asses?!

Chris:
 Dad did! Look, he's got crap on his ears!

Peter:
 That's unrelated.

Lois:
 Chris, I don't like that language.

Chris:
 Well, I don't like your cooking!

Lois:
 Well, I don't like having to literally empty the farts out of your pockets whenever I do your laundry!

Chris:
 You're the one who's always cooking Brussels sprouts and broccoli! It's like an Irish bar fight down there!

Broccoli:
 You're from one town over, so I hate your guts.

Chris:
 WHY DON'T WE EVER GET ANY GOOD FOOD?!

Peter:
 Yeah, Bonnie gives Joe wonder bread.

Lois:
 Well, then go live at Bonnie's house! Then I could finally sleep in and not have to answer your stupid questions at 5 a.m.!

Peter:
 My curiosity peaks in the morning!

Chris:
 You eat all my Dannon yogurts!

Peter:
 I don't see your name on 'em!

Chris:
 You don't even like 'em, but you know I do, and you don't want me to have 'em!

Lois:
 You know, I've never confronted you on it, but I've often thought the same thing, Peter.

Meg:
 Yeah, that's exactly what he does, 'cause he's a selfish, fat idiot!

Peter:
 You shut up! All of youse! [runs upstairs, and then turns to the family with tears in his eyes] I didn't ask to be in this family!

Lois:
 [sighs] I'll go get him. [picks up Stewie] Peter, you come back here!

Chris:
 [shouting at Meg] I faked all my orgasms!

Meg :
 You guys, I have something to say. You're right. It's all my fault.

Meg:
 Mom, you're an amazing mother and all the things I said about you were out of anger, and I didn't mean any of them. Chris, you're an outstanding brother. What I said about you was more about me being a rotten sister. And Dad, I'm so sorry that I made you feel this way. You don't deserve it. None of you have done anything wrong. I took all my problems out on you guys, and that wasn't fair.

Stewie:
 Y'know, Brian, you may be a dog, but you're a pretty cool cat.

Megroach:
 I think you gave me worms, Brian.

Lois:
 Wanna have sssssex?

Monster Quagmire:
 Groggety!

Peter:
 You know I...I've been sittin' back here, takin' all this in, because I thought I wouldn't have a dog in this fight. But my money is on Harry Potter over there.

Brian:
 okay, five minutes Ms. Ga-GINA BIG! and I will be right back with your Evian.

Lois:
 Meg, how could you put us all through that?!

Meg:
 I'm sorry, you guys.

Stewie:
 Hi, I'm Stewie Griffin. Tonight's Family Guy was a very special episode about drug use. But the simple fact is it's no laughing matter. To learn more about drugs, visit your local library. There's probably a guy behind there who sells drugs. Good night.

Stewie:
 Good morning...is what normal families would say.

Peter:
 Aww, that yellow lab looks like it's dying.

Lois:
 Peter, that's Gwyneth Paltrow, she's fine.

Peter:
 Sheesh, Quagmire, you look terrible.

Quagmire:
 I didn't get any sleep.

Lois:
 Hi, Glenn. How are you?

Quagmire:
 Not great, Lois. I'm in the middle of some bad stuff with my sister.

Lois:
 Yes, there was quite a ruckus going on there last night. That Jeff seems like some kind of a monster.

Peter:
 Yeah, that guy's scary as an Iraq lobster.

Quagmire:
 Joe, the guy's a menace. They've been with me for three days now and all he does is beat her day and night. And on top of that, they say they don't need to be entertained, but they're always like, "So what are we doing? What's next?"

Peter:
 Hey Joe, can't you just arrest the guy?

Joe:
 I can't arrest Jeff unless Brenda files a complaint with the police.

Quagmire:
 She won't go to the police. She's afraid of what Jeff'll do. And to be honest, I don't blame her. I mean, what happens if one of these days, he hits her so hard, he kills her?

Joe:
 Sorry, Quagmire. Police policy, we can't step in until it's too late. If I were you, I'd set up an intervention.

Peter:
 What's that?

Joe:
 It's like a surprise birthday party but instead of cake and presents, there's angry letters and someone who inappropriately tries to make it about themselves.

Peter:
 That sounds great! I bet I would really shine at one of those.

Quagmire:
 Brenda, the fact that you are being abused has affected my life in the following ways. The sister that I knew and loved growing up no longer exists. The person I see before me right now is just a punching bag. And I call you "person" and not "woman," because a woman is a strong, beautiful vibrant creature. A woman embraces life. A woman makes choices to make her life better. Sadly, the fact that you are with Jeff proves to me that you have made a choice to make your life worse. [Quagmire starts crying] I... I want the girl who I grew up with back. I want... I... I want my sister back.

Brenda:
 Well, I best be rolling on now.

Quagmire:
 Come on, who says that?

Joe:
 It's an expression!

Peter:
 Yeah, if you're in a wheelchair!

Quagmire:
 Guys, what the hell am I gonna do? She can't marry that bastard! He's just gonna keep beating her and he's gonna beat the kid, too!! God, I wish she'd never met Jeffrey Fecalman.

Peter:
 You know, I was thinking... Wait, what?

Quagmire:
 What?

Peter:
 That's his name?

Quagmire:
 Well, yeah.

Peter:
 Hilarious, but you know what, I was thinking this afternoon, what the hell happened to the days where a guy does something like that to a girl, and a bunch of us guys get together and just go kick his fucking ass.

Joe:
 Boy, that'd be satisfying.

Quagmire:
 Well, why not?

Quagmire:
 The three of us, we go over there and do what's right! We kill the bastard!

Joe:
 Woah, woah, Quagmire, you know I could have you arrested for saying that.

Peter:
 You know what else you can get arrested for? Soliciting a rooster.

Man:
 I don't know what this "Cock-a-doodle-doo" thing is, but it sounds gay and scatological. [pulls out dollar] I'm in.

Rooster:
 You're about to have a neat day.

Joe:
 Quagmire, you're talking about murdering a guy. It doesn't matter what he's done! It's still murder!

Quagmire:
 No, Joe, it does matter what he's done! These types of guys won't change! Y-You think they suddenly wake up and see the error of their ways and clean up their act?! NO!! They just keep ruining other people's lives, and the world is better off without them!

Joe:
 It's against the law, Quagmire, and that's the end of it! [Hears Brenda screaming in fear after Jeff beats her, the three look out the window]

Jeff:
 What the hell?! DID YOU CHANGE THE CHANNEL WHILE I WAS GETTING A BEER?!

Brenda:
 Um, yeah, sorry honey, I just wanted to see who was on Letterman.

Jeff:
 WE'RE WATCHING LENO, YOU BITCH!

Brenda:
 I'm so sorry!

Jeff:
 HIS SOFT GENTLE HUMOR CONNECTS EFFORTLESSLY WITH MY MAINSTREAM CAPABILITIES! [Brenda screams in fear again after Jeff beats her]

Joe:
 Let's waste this dick.

Jeff:
 What the hell?! I killed you!

Quagmire:
 I choke myself every day, you bastard!

Peter:
 I kind of want to kill somebody else now. Ooh, Mort!

Stewie:
 [baffled at Brian's damaged Prius] Oh God! Oh my God, I'm in so much trouble!

Butt:
 [on the radio] Congratulations, you caller number 5! You're going to see Justin Bieber!

Herbert:
 Oh sweet Jesus! Yes Jesse, I won! Never say never!

Brian:
 Look at this! Do you know anything about this?!

Stewie:
 About what? What a beautiful day...Oh, my God, that is surpriiising! I had to stop the last sentence in the middle because I was so surprised. What happened?

Brian:
 Gee, I don't know. Do YOU know what happened?

Stewie:
 [chuckles] Sorry, what was that? I was laughing at that funny thing you said at dinner the other night.

Brian:
 What funny thing?

Stewie:
 You remember when you said how Lois' potatoes "au rotten"?

Brian:
 Huh. Didn't think anybody heard that. Wish you laughed at the time, but what the hell happened to my car?!

Stewie:
 Well, I don't know man, but the good news is that [Walks over to one dent of a car] It's that spot right there that's upsetting you.

Brian:
 Stewie, I know it was you. [Grabs Rupert out of the car and shows it to Stewie]

Stewie:
 Your potato joke was terrible.

Brian:
 I can't believe you drove my car! Y...You could've gotten yourself killed! I'm gonna have to tell Peter and Lois

Stewie:
 NO!!! No, you can't tell them, I'll be in so much trouble!

Brian:
 Stewie, I have to, all right? I have covered for you plenty of times before, but not this time! This is very dangerous and I have to make sure you never do it again.

Stewie:
 I won't I swear! [Wails like a baby]

Brian:
 Stewie, calm down. Sometimes in life, you have to accept what's coming to you.

Stewie:
 Brian, I've decided to run away. Don't come looking for me. And definitely don't chase me to the airport and catch me at the gate just before I'm about to get on a plane with, like, an emotional speech and possibly flowers. For instance, it would be awful if all the TSA people were gathered around watching this emotional moment, even the older black female carry-on scanner who initially stopped you at the baggage check, but after you told her of your intentions said, "Go get him, child," in flagrant disregard for all newly-implemented post-9/11 security measures. And if you were considering bringing a boombox to play music, I would suggest any one of these six songs.

Stewie:
 So, again, ran away. Don't come after me.

Brian:
 Let's see, new novel, new novel. What's it about? A guy who loses everything, but finds his soul in Canada. Alright, cooking now. And the whole book is an e-mail to his daughter who's dead. And his name will be Norm Hull, 'cause he's just a normal guy. But not everybody will get that. That's just for the scholars a hundred years from now.

Stewie:
 What am I gonna do? I'm in so much trouble when they find out I crashed Brian's car. They'll probably ship me off to Siberia.

Stewie:
 This sucks, I hate it here.

Russian woman:
 Shut up. Drink wolf milk and watch Russian cartoon.

Russian TV:
 We now return with popular Russian cartoon Shoe & Shoelace.

Russian TV:
 Shoe & Shoelace. One is meaningless without the other!

Ryan:
 Hey! Look who it is!

Peter:
 Hey, Ryan Reynolds. What are you doing in Cleveland's house?

Ryan:
 Well, believe it or not; they've decided to shoot my movie in Quahog instead of Newport. I'm playing Hitler, but it's a young Hitler and he's got a rockin' body. It's called Hotler.

Peter:
 Ha! Color me seven bucks lighter!

Stewie:
 At least I'm not getting stabbed by a random guy on the street.

Stewie:
 [to camera] See, it's the exact opposite!

Stewie:
 Oh, it happened anyway.

Peter:
 I just can't help but wonder...will I ever see him again?

Brian:
 [standing outside the pilot house] That's odd, that's our house but somehow it looks a little different.

Pilot Meg:
 [from inside the pilot house] Mom, my lips are too thin. Can I please get collagen injections?

Pilot Lois:
 Meg, you don't need to change the way you look. You know, most of the world's problems stem from poor self-image.

Stewie:
 Oh my God, what's with Meg's voice? She sounds like someone who's about to give up a huge opportunity.

Brian:
 That's nothing, look at you. You look like a prize at some Mexican church carnival.

Pilot Lois:
 Oh, don't pout, honey. You know, when you were born, the doctor said you were the happiest looking baby he had ever seen.

Pilot Stewie:
 But, of course! That was my victory day! The fruition of my deeply-laid plans to escape from that cursed ovarian Bastille. Return the device, woman!

Brian:
 Jeez, what'd you carry a thesaurus around with you?

Stewie:
 Y'know, it's amazing I could speak at all with that circumcision still healing.

Pilot Brian:
 Woah, ass ahoy. Hey, uh, Peter, it's seven o'clock and you still got your pants on. What's the occasion?

Stewie:
 Ew, I remember this. Peter's eye did that weird creepy thing where it went over his nose.

Pilot Peter:
 Come on, you're worryin' about nothin'.

Pilot Lois:
 Oh? Remember when you got drunk off the communion wine at church?

Stewie:
 Ah, ew, gross look at that!

Brian:
 Wait, what are they doing?

Stewie:
 I dunno, they're just...standing there like zombies.

Brian:
 Do you think they're all right?

Stewie:
 I'm...I'm...I'm...I'm not sure.

Pilot Lois:
 And then there was that time at the ice cream store.

Brian:
 They're doing it again, what the hell?

Stewie:
 I'm...I'm...I'm at a loss.

Brian:
 I know we're not supposed to mess with the timeline, but should we...call an ambulance?

Stewie:
 That is so creepy.

Pilot Brian:
 [emerging from behind the table] And remember you had an Irish coffee the day we went to see Philadelphia?

Stewie:
 Oh, they're...they're doi...they're setting up fucking cutaways.

Brian:
 Oh, my God, is that what we did back then?

Stewie:
 Yeah, now we just return text messages and screw around and whatnot.

Peter:
 Lois, I'm not goin' back to work tomorrow! That new boss has it in for me! He's meaner than a shifty salesman.

Lois:
 You sure you got time to smoke?

Peter:
 Oh, yeah, it's an Al Harrington, it goes on for a while.

Stewie:
 Oh...hey.

Pilot Stewie:
 Who the deuce are you?

Stewie:
 Um, well, I'm, uh...I'm you.

Pilot Stewie:
 You look like me, but that's utterly impossible!

Stewie:
 I'm afraid it's true. I'm you from the future. I've traveled back in time.

Pilot Stewie:
 That's absurd!

Stewie:
 Look, I can prove to you that I'm you from the future. I know about the Eddie Bauer catalog.

Pilot Stewie:
 [gasps] It is you!

Brian:
 Aw, look at that. There's the old gang we've gotten to know so well over the years.

Stewie:
 TV's not even plugged in.

Pilot Brian:
 Woah, crash ahoy!

Brian:
 Oh, God, now where are we?

Pilot Peter:
 ...Well, I figured the sooner I'd cash the check, the sooner they'd, ehh, catch their mistake. Look, why are we making a federal case out of this?

Brian:
 Oh man, this is the day Peter went to court for his welfare fraud.

Stewie:
 Hey.

Aid Man:
 Huh? Oh, hey.

Stewie:
 You're the Kool Aid guy.

Kool Aid Man:
 Yeah.

Stewie:
 What are you doing?

Kool Aid man:
 Just waiting.

Stewie:
 For what?

Kool Aid Man:
 [Annoyed] I'm just waiting dude, relax.

Brian:
 Hey, is there any place around here that sells batteries?

Kool Aid Man:
 [More annoyed] Guys, do...don't distract me, alright? I g...I gotta really be up.

Pilot Judge:
 Mr. Griffin, I think your words have touched us all. I'm sentencing you to 24 months in prison! [gavel]

Pilot Lois:
 Oh no!

Pilot Brian:
 Oh no!

Pilot Chris:
 Oh no!

Pilot Meg:
 Oh no!

Stewie:
 So there's no organs or glands or anything right? It's just the liquid?

Kool Aid Man:
 Yeah, yeah, it's just the liquid.

Stewie:
 Umm... I don't know if this is a weird question but, can I have some?

Kool Aid Man:
 Alright, fine. Tilt your head back and I'll lean my liquid down into your mouth.

Stewie:
 Oh, now I don't want it.

Kool Aid Man:
 Oh crap, did I miss it?

Pilot Lois:
 Look, my husband may be a bit thoughtless at times, he may even be downright, well, stupid, but, I know he only accepted that money because he...

Kool Aid Man:
 Oh Yeah! Oh Yeah! Yeah!

Kool Aid Man:
 You guys did this! You guys fucking did this! Talking about my guts! Fucking me up! Fuck you!

Stewie:
 The Super Bowl was cool, but frankly, no Tommy Brady, no Stewie likee.

Stewie:
 What did I tell you about altering the past? Wait, when did you even do that?

Brian:
 Well, remember when I said I was gonna take a leak?

Stewie:
 Brian, you shouldn't have done that. Who knows what unforeseen consequences are awaiting us? Saddam Hussein could be president. Mexico could be the world's dominant super power. Cookie Monster could have invented Facebook.

Man:
 What is this?

Cookie Monster:
 Cookiebook.

Tom Tucker:
 Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

Joyce Kinney:
 And I'm Joyce Kinney.

Tom Tucker:
 Our top story, Quahog prepares to unveil a new statue commemorating perhaps its greatest hero ever.

Joyce Kinney:
 That's right, Tom. It was 10 years ago that an almost inconceivable plot to destroy the World Trade Center was thwarted by Quahog's own Brian Griffin.

Tom Tucker:
 This amateur video captured Griffin's heroism in the face of a shadowy terrorist organization called...[going off script] Holy shit, look at all those vowels. [squinting to try to read the teleprompter] Al Kwa-ay-ee-duh?

Brian:
 [on TV] Here, make sure you get all this. [Brian gets a baseball bat from the overhead bin] Time to terrorize the terrorists!

Stewie:
 Uch, you prepared catchphrases for yourself?

Brian:
 No. Not necessarily.

Brian:
 [on TV] Mohamed Atta stayed home!

Stewie:
 Nobody even knows that guy's name yet! You're using information that nobody knows!

Brian:
 [on TV] Houston, we have a solution!

Stewie:
 Houston's for space, not everyday air travel!!

Brian:
 [on TV] Tell 'em to ground every plane on the East Coast! Seacrest out!

Tom Tucker:
 Wow, what a hero! Coming up next in sports: "Arizona Cardinals running back Pat Tillman tackled by his own team?"

Lois:
 Oh, Brian, we're so proud of you.

Peter:
 Yeah, buddy, great job stoppin' those terrorists. And thank God their follow-up attack on St. Louis was a bust.

Terrorist:
 We missed!

Future Peter:
 Hey Lois, I found some double-sided tape. I think I can do about seven minutes worth of funny stuff with it. That should get us to the "Meg Kissing Booth" story.

Future Peter:
 Chris, I heard you got a "D" on your report card. Here's a cutaway.

Future Peter:
 Matthew McConaughey is terrible.

Future Frogmire:
 Ribbity.

Stewie:
 [talking to the Brian who went back in time first] Also, if you don't give that Stewie a backrub, it'll really mess things up.

Brian:
 Did that do it?

Stewie:
 Only one way to find out. [opens his laptop and searches on the Internet] 9....11. Oh! We did it, Brian! We made 9/11 happen, high five!

Brian:
 Alright, yeah, high five!

Stewie:
 [giving Brian a high five, simultaneously] Yeah, alright!...Wow...that wouldn't look very good out of context.

Lois:
 [carrying a hamper of dirty clothes] There's the writer of the Harry Potter series, must be weird hanging out with us muggles, huh, Brian?

Brian:
 [in realization of what he just did] Huh, yeah.

Lois:
 Well, "laundrium insertum!"

Peter:
 I don't know what I'm doin' here. I was just lookin' for the can.

Stewie:
 Alright, everybody, SHUT THE HELL UP!! [everyone pays attention to the Stewie on the trashcan] Alright, this is bullshit! Alright, I can't follow what's going on anymore! I'm assuming the rest of you can't either. So let's make this easy and take a vote! How many think we should prevent 9/11, raise your hands? [Peter and some of the Brians and Stewies raise their hands, and Stewie counts them quietly] Alright, looks like 42. Alright, who votes "yes" 9/11? [Some of the Stewies, Brians, and Peter again, raise their hands and Stewie counts them again] Okay, alright, 57. Alright, 9/11 wins.

Brian:
 Wa-wait, shouldn't it be an even number? Why is the total an odd number?

Stewie Duplicate:
 Um, yeah, I think one of the Brians died.

Brian:
 Wh-What do you mean?

Stewie Duplicate:
 I dunno, one of them landed here with his throat slit.

Brian:
 [looking at the pilot house] Wait a minute, isn't this where we just were? Where are the other two us's?

Stewie:
 They're not here yet. Just to make sure there are absolutely no loose ends, I've sent us back in time to the moment just before we originally arrived.

Brian:
 Why?

Stewie:
 You'll see. [The Stewie and Brian from the beginning of the episode appear and Stewie gets a gun out] GET THE FUCK BACK IN YOUR TIME MACHINE!!!!!!

Brian from the Beginning of the Episode:
 Dah!

Stewie from the Beginning of the Episode:
 Who are you?!

Stewie:
 NEVERMIND WHO I AM!!!! JUST GET BACK IN YOUR TIME MACHINE, GET BACK TO THE PRESENT AND STAY THERE!!!!

Brian from the Beginning of the Episode:
 Look, just calm down...

Stewie:
 You gonna flap your lips, or you gonna do what I said?

Brian from the Beginning of the Episode:
 Okay, okay.

Stewie from the Beginning of the Episode:
 My God!

Brian:
 You just talked to yourself. Won't that alter the past?

Stewie:
 Don't worry, Brian. If I were successful in restoring the past just now, you and I will never have existed. The chronological tangent that created us will have been erased.

Brian:
 Oh. Is it gonna hurt?

Stewie:
 Just a little.

Brian:
 Oh God, my leg is killing me.

Stewie:
 Well, time travel is risky. Every time you step into that machine you invite the possibility of altering the world as we know it. Thankfully the alternate versions of us were there to prevent us from doing whatever it is we apparently did.

Brian:
 I wonder what it was..

Stewie:
 We'll never know. But look on the bright side, you might be sitting here with a hole in your leg but at least our present universe hasn't been affected.

Peter:
 Sorry guys I'm gonna need the couch, the gang and I are gonna watch the game. Alright, let's unplug the TV and get going!

Brian:
 Peter you didn't even know what 9/11 was until 2004.

Peter:
 That's not true Brian. I remember 9/11.

Peter:
 'Eh must have been a woman pilot huh?

Tom Tucker :
 And here comes Oliver Stone. Here to promote his new movie, "Born on the Fourth of July 2: Born on the Fifth of July," which he promises to be even "July-i-er" than the first... A dangerously insane man, there.

Immigration Officer :
 Complete this sentence: The land of the free and the home of the blank.

Peter:
 Home of the Whopper?

Peter:
 Now your talking Angela, this country needs more immigrants like my cousin Peter the Pig a new house

Peter the Pig :
 ah I wouldn't do that if I were you

Big Bad wolf :
 What?

Peter the Pig :
 I said I wouldn't do that

Peter the Pig :
 I said knock it of.

Big Bad wolf :
 why?

Peter the Pig :
 Because I made stool in there & if you blow it down the whole woods is gonna stink. do you understand, do you understand me sir.

Peter:
 Hello, my American family.

Lois:
 Peter, where did you get that suit?

Stewie:
 My God, you look like the Statue of Liberty's pimp!

Brian:
 Peter, why did you have my acupuncturist arrested?

Peter:
 Because he was an illegal immigrant and a threat to our national security.

Brian:
 He was an 85-year-old Korean Buddhist.

Peter:
 Or was he supreme leader of al-Qaeda? I guess we'll find out if he ever gets a trial.

Brian:
 Peter, America was founded by immigrants. Everyone here is the descendant of an immigrant. They're a vital part of our society.

Peter:
 [a la Darth Vader]  They are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor. Take 'em away!

Lois:
 Oh, Peter, you look exhausted.

Peter:
 I am, Lois. Life as a Mexican immigrant is brutal. Even after seven jobs and joining Menudo, I only made 25 bucks.

Lois:
 Now, look, don't get upset, but I've been so worried about you that I asked someone for help.

Peter:
 Who?

Carter :
 Hello, fatass.

Peter:
 [defiantly]  Lois, immigrants don't take handouts. They just take one DVD a month from the house they're cleaning until they have a respectable collection.

Lois:
 It's not a handout, it's a job. Daddy employs lots of immigrants, and he said you could work at the mansion.

Peter:
 Really? Well, thanks a lot, Mr. Pewterschmidt. I promise I won't let you down.

Carter :
 Well, they all do eventually. Except for Noriega. God bless him and his drug money. I wish he were here today.

Noriega :
 Hi, Mr. Pewterschmidt.

Carter :
 Oh, look who it is!

Carter :
 Come here so I can give you a hug. Come here so I can give you a hug.

Chris:
 [at a Veteran's Day parade]  Mom, how come when we see these guys on the street corner, you tell me not to stare at 'em, and today that's all we're doing?

Lois:
 Because, Chris, as Americans, we owe our lives to these veterans.

Peter:
 Hey, look, Lois. "The John McCain Experience."

Peter:
 Aah! Aah! Aah!

Peter:
 I wanna be president!

Peter:
 So, give me the good news. Did I pass?

INS Employee :
 I'm afraid it doesn't look good for you, Señor . So far, you've failed everything, including the "behaving like an American at the airport" test.

Peter:
 No, it wasn't bad. Yeah, I'm on my way to the next plane now. Yeah, I got a middle seat, so I'm gonna see if I can switch. Ooh, a Sbarro. I'm gonna get a big, fat piece of pizza so I got something to stuff in my face while I'm reading USA Today.

Lois:
 Peter, have you seen Stewie's Speedy Gonzales video? He won't go to sleep without it.

Peter:
 I threw it away.

Stewie:
 What? What the hell, man? I don't throw away your stuff. And where's my goat?

Lois:
 Peter, why would you do that?

Peter:
 Because Speedy Gonzales is an immigrant and a bad influence on our children, so I created his American equivalent, Rapid Dave.

Sylvester :
 I got you now, mouse.

Rapid Dave :
 Yeah? Well, up yours, cat. Quickly, quickly, quickly, run fast!

Rapid Dave :
 Run fast, quickly!

Peter:
 Man, that really makes me mad: illegal immigrants coming into this country, taking all the good jobs away from Americans. Well, I am gonna make sure people like that stay out of Quahog from now on. We are gonna patrol the borders and keep this town as clean as a Jewish porno.

Peter:
 Boy, I never knew it would feel this good to love my country. It's like loving God or a step-parent. Y-You never really feel them love you back, but that's okay because they got other stuff going on and you understand.

Brian:
 Peter, you do realize there's a difference between loving America and being swept up in post-9/11 paranoia.

Peter:
 Brian, are you suggesting that 9/11 didn't change everything?

Brian:
 What? No, I was just...

Peter:
 Because 9/11 changed everything, Brian. 9/11 changed everything.

Lois:
 Peter, how come you're not at work?

Peter:
 I got fired for being an illegal immigrant.

Lois:
 Oh, dear. You know, Peter, you can always take a citizenship test. I mean, if Wilmer Valderrama passed, it can't be that difficult.

Peter:
 Well, by that logic, Lois, it can't be that difficult to nail Lindsay Lohan.

Lois:
 I don't think it is.

Peter:
 Oh. Well, good news there. All right, you wanna head down to the INS?

Lois:
 Peter, what are you gonna do about a job? We can't just keep eating into our savings.

Peter:
 I'll just have to find a job for an illegal immigrant.

Meg:
 I can't believe this is happening to our family.

Peter:
 It's taken us all by surprise, Meg. Like that realistic original ending to "Dirty Dancing".

Joe Swanson :
 Wow, Peter, you're really becoming quite the patriot.

Peter:
 You bet I am. I just had my penis tattooed to look like the Space Shuttle and my nads tattooed to look like launch exhaust.

Glenn Quagmire :
 [thinking]  That bastard! That was my idea; he stole it. I was gonna do that to my penis. Oh, well, maybe I can do something else like-like... like the Space Needle or a banana... or a Sharpie. Ah, I'm boring myself. Guess I'll listen to some music.

Carter :
 What's going on here?

Peter:
 We're taking what's ours! Actually, we're taking what's yours, but we don't think you deserve it, so we're calling it ours and taking it!

Stewie:
 Well, now I've seen Woodrow Wilson naked.

Peter:
 Oh, you're on TV! That's so cool! We're going right to the top together. Oh, you think you're better than us, huh? Just one fucking stroke of luck, and you're there and I'm here.

Peter:
 Jeez, every cop in the town is here.

Quagmire:
 I know. What do ya thinks taken care of the city?

Consuela:
 No. No. No. No. [mops a puddle]

Driver:
 What the hell? Come on!

Consuela:
 No drive, is wet.

Peter:
 Breaker-breaker 1-9, what's your 20?

Peter:
 Aw, it's so hot just knowin' you're in a truck.

Bonnie:
 You're right on time, Kevin just woke up screaming from his afternoon nap.

Kevin:
 Mom, it's my birthday and you invited your friends.

Bonnie:
 All yours are dead!

Chris:
 Does the Swanson divorce mean that I have to go live with grandma and grandpa?

Lois:
 No Chris, it does not; that doesn't even make any sense.

Stewie:
 Why did the sign say "not an exit"?! It should've just said "gorilla door"!

Joe:
 It feels good to know that thanks to me and my colleagues, a lot fewer people will be injecting cocaine into their penises tonight.

Peter:
 Secrets are what keep a marriage fresh.

Tom Tucker:
 That's right, Joyce, apparently, there were over one hundred kilos of cocaine right here in Quahog. And yet my guy can't get dick.

Lois:
 Guess who I just ran into at the market? Ross Fishman!

Peter:
 Your old boyfriend? The one with the penis?

Lois:
 We're going.

Peter:
 All right, fine. But I'm gonna stare at his wife's boobs so hard that when they both go into the kitchen together, it will be discussed.

Peter:
 Well, they look better when they're oiled up. [To Chris] Pass the salad dressing. Oh, no, it's an almost empty squeeze bottle. Hang on. [squirts whatever is left onto his body] Eh, it's all out. [to Chris] There's dressing on that salad! Gimme that salad! [puts some salad onto his body] Yeah, who's the better man now, Ross?!

Ross:
 Well, this year is perhaps our biggest trip ever. We're climbing Mt. Everest.

Peter:
 Oh, yeah, is that right? Well, so are we!

Lois:
 We are?

Ross:
 Peter, I highly doubt that. I mean, no offense, but it doesn't look like your family would be up to the task.

Brian:
 I think he's right about that. After all, we couldn't even turn the double play.

Peter:
 Alright, Griffins, on the ground, we're goin' to second. Let's turn to here. Ground ball's a double play ball plays in second. Let's look sharp. Tough team tough team. Let's flash that leather. Head in the game. Play's at second. This infield is a Great Wall of China, nothin's gettin' past us. Good deal, behind ya, Bri, good deal all around. [a fastball punches Peter in the throat, changing his voice to sound like Stewie] I'm okay, everyone. Don't worry. I am okay. My voice sounds weird. This is weird, I know, but I feel fine.

Peter:
 [to Ross] On a scale of 1 to 10, how bad is the bathroom situation up here? Like "10" is a suite at the Four Seasons and "1" is a tied-up raincoat sleeve at a party in your honor.

Peter:
 We don't need a map, Brian.  I got us a GPMS machine.

GPMS machine:
 Go up! What do you think?! Just go up!

Peter:
 Sorry.

GPMS machine:
 Okay, can everyone just stop freaking out and just gimme, like, two minutes?! God!! [sobbing] Everyone's always yelling at me...all the questions!

Peter:
 Alright, maybe, we'll turn you on later and see how you feel. [turns machine off, to Brian] She was so nice in the store.

Peter:
 I think I got altitude sickness.

Peter:
 Hey Brian, you want a pukesickle?

Brian:
 I would love a pukesickle.

Peter:
 Hey, ya know, I heard that when you drink at high altitude, it hits you even faster. [drinks a Pawtucket Patriot] WOOOO! Partyyyyyyy! I love you guys!  You don't know how much you mean to me!  You think you're better than me?! Why can't you hit a curveball?! [sobbing] I've done nothing with my life!

Peter:
 I think I might have left the weed whacker on.

Lois:
 Close the tent now! It's freezing!

Peter:
 "Headline: Woman Cold."

Peter:
 Everyone do a hilarious pose so that when they dig out our bodies, they have a good laugh.

Peter:
 There's a huge pile of dead bodies down here that cushioned my fall!

Lois:
 Do any of them seem like they have any extra tampons in their backpacks?!

Peter:
 Uh, no!

Lois:
 "No", like you checked and there aren't any "no", or "no", you're just assumin'?!

Peter:
 I...I'm embarrassed!

Lois:
 Oh Stewie, how exciting, your first visit to a real fire station.

Stewie:
 My name's Peter, and I work in the brewery. Now I'm gonna put on my pants and talk to my coworker's a...these pants have stool in them.

Peter:
 Hey Chris, you think it's safe to drink from a fire hose?

Chris:
 Why not Dad? It's just water.

Peter:
 Alright turn it on, I'm very thirsty.

Peter:
 Nice job, Chris, you got my shirt wet.

Peter:
 All right everyone. Time to do our Nielsen duty. So what are we going to watch?

Chris:
 Boobs!

Meg:
 Project Runway!

Lois:
 The Good Wife!

Stewie:
 That black version of our show.

Lois:
 My God, Peter, they're really angry. Say something.

Peter:
 Wait a minute. What the hell are you guys talking about? What do you mean I ruined television?

Quagmire:
 You put a real cougar on Cougar Town! And now that cougar's dead because Courtney Cox ripped it apart with her teeth and claws!

Seamus:
 You turned Anderson Cooper 360 into Anderson Cooper 720! He's turning around too much!

Carter:
 You converted The Biggest Loser to the metric system! Now it feels like they're not losing enough!

Peter:
 Ah, the hell with you guys! You're just jealous 'cause I get to say what's on TV now! I am a Nielsen god!

Bruce:
 Sorry, y'all. That's the first time I ever throwed anything.

Peter:
 Hey, how you guys doing?

Joe:
 Not So Good, Peter.

Quagmire:
 Yeah, me neither. Thanks to you, TV's a vast wasteland. You know how I know that phrase? I read it in a BOOK, you MONSTER!!

Peter:
 Come on, I'll make it up to you; let me buy you a beer.

Joe:
 NO! That seat's TAKEN. Move along, Peter.

Peter:
 W...w...What are you talking about? You guys are my pals!

Quagmire:
 We USED to be, Peter. Now SCRAM.

Peter:
 Fine, I'll sit at the bar.

Horace:
 Not at MY bar you won't. GET OUT OF HERE.

Peter:
 This is Peter Griffin, and you're listening to Book Talk on WRNI. Today, we will be discussing Brett Easton Ellis' popular book  Less than Zero. A tale of privilege, detachment, and youthful alienation. [Takes a sip of tea] But first, a word from our sponsor, Weston's Golden Soda Biscuits. I'm enjoying one right now. [crunches on cracker loudly, and slurps tea.] That concludes today's session of Book Talk. Tune in tomorrow, where we will be looking at John Kennedy Toole's unheralded early work The Neon Bible.

Peter:
 I miss my friends, Brian. I mean, I was having fun with those Nielsen boxes, but what's the point if I don't got Joe and Quagmire to enjoy it with me? I guess I shouldn't have messed with television.

Brian:
 Well, you still have these boxes. That means you still have the power to influence television. Maybe you can use that power to help restore TV to the way it was.

Brian:
 Oh, my God, he destroyed every last box!

Brian:
 We're sunk now, Peter. There goes your one chance to get TV back to the way it was.

Peter:
 I'm Peter Griffin. I'm the guy who ruined television and I'm the guy who's gonna fix it.

Homer:
 Guys! I broke television, and now you have to help me fix it!

Peter:
 Yah-ha! Looks like this is one we beat you to.

Peter:
 Gentlemen, I have gathered you all here today because you are the creators of what television used to be before I ruined it. And we need to rebuild television from the ground up, so I'm gonna need all your best ideas. J.J. Abrams, you take wonder and complexity and present it in a way that no one can possibly understand. What do you got?

 Abrams:
 I've got an alien that goes back in time and encounters a koala bear in an Eastern European town.

Peter:
 Totally confused. Do it.

Peter:
 Okay, now, we're gonna need 15 workplace comedies where people talk to the camera for some reason. [points to four people] You, you, you and you...go.

Man:
 When Peter told me to make a workplace comedy where people talk to the camera, I thought...

Peter:
 Not now! I mean, go do a show! Don't...don't do that thing here.

Peter:
 Huh. Wonder if I can pull off one of those "can you believe what I have to put up with" looks to the camera.

Peter:
 Okay, Mark Burnett, you did Survivor and The Apprentice. Can you give me a reality show where people do horrible, unforgivable things to each other for embarrassingly small sums of money?

Mark Burnett:
 I got some ideas. Here's a nickel, pull down your pants.

Mark Burnett:
 There's a show.

Peter:
 Yah-ha! Go!

Peter:
 All right, now, who's gonna make a show about horrible New Jersey freaks? You know what? I don't care. Just someone, do it.

Peter:
 Okay, Dick Wolf, make the same Law & Order six times. Oh, and also, could you marry Matt Wiener? 'Cause I want your name to be Dick Wiener.

Dick Wolf:
 Okay, but can I go by Dick Wolf Wiener?

Peter:
 Oh, my God, yes! Yes! Yes! Yes. Okay, Bravo people, go find women fighting. No, you know what? Just find women. They'll end up fighting. All right, everyone who's left, make a talent show. [everyone else, except Kelsey Grammer, walks out of the room] We are done. [Peter notices Grammer] Oh. Kelsey Grammer, what are you still doing here? I...I have nothing left for you. I'm...I'm sorry.

Kelsey Grammer:
 Ah. Then I shall take my ease on the lanai.

Peter:
 I don't care what you do now.

TV Announcer:
 We now return to Mike & Molly.

Waiter:
 Have you decided what you'd like to order?

Mike:
 Yes, the chopped salad? I'll have everything except that.

Peter:
 [laughs] That waiter's like, "What?!"

Joe:
 Well, you did it, Peter. You got TV back to normal.

Peter:
 Yeah, guys, I'm sorry for screwing up all your favorite shows.

Quagmire:
 Ah, that's okay, Peter.

Peter:
 So, what do you say? Are we pals again?

Quagmire:
 Ah, course we are.

Joe:
 You bet.

Peter:
 Well, let's drink to having TV back in the hands of people who know what they're doing.

Herbert:
 I think Zack and Cody would be funnier if they did the show in their underpants.

Peter:
 I learned how to do a somersault.

Peter:
 I guess all this time Quagmire should've been saying "Wiggity."

Announcer:
 And now it's time for the Channel 5 Sports report, brought to you by Kia. Kia: Too bad it's a Kia.

Peter:
 Come on, it's not so bad. You could always kill yourself.

Quagmire:
 I hate the Yankees.

Peter:
 Yeah! You are all villains to me because I happen to live in this part of the country. Yeah!

Quagmire:
 Slow down! Drive like hell, you'll get there.

Stewie:
 I don't think so. The crotch doesn't look like a BMX track. You bastard!! You've been using my time machine to nail your bar skanks!!!

Stewie:
 Oh, yes, I've seen the women you bring home. That stutterer, she was a real prize.

Peter:
 [walking up to the thermostat] Oh, for cryin' out loud.

Lois:
 Peter, why are you turnin' up the heat again?

Peter:
 Lois, this woman is obviously freezing.

Lois:
 There, now you got a fresh new diaper, Stewie.

Stewie:
 What are you talking about?

Stewie:
 What's going on?

Brian:
 I think you're getting a diaper change.

Stewie:
 DAHHH! Get that poop-filled thing away from me! No! Oh, God it's cold!

Lois:
 Ooh, smells like somebody needs a diaper change.

Stewie:
 Damn right, I do!  Now get this turd filled sack off...Oh, God, it just went back in my body.

Lois:
 "Your trash barrels were a little close to our driveway. -Joe P.S. Please close the windows when you give piano lessons. My legs don't work, but my ears do."

Brian:
 Where does Quagmire meet all these women?

Stewie:
 This is why Boxbuster went out of business.

Stewie:
 What are you watching?

Brian:
 Meet the Press. It's really weird, in reverse time, the Republicans make outrageous statements and then the host asks an unrelated question.

Conservative:
 Global warming is a myth!! God created everything and the world is getting colder!!

Host:
 What is your tax plan?

Cleveland:
 Man, we got a large number of clovers on our lawn. [He floats up while the damage of both the house and the bathtub undo themselves] No, no, no, no, no, NO!!!!

Brian:
 This is more intense than when I fought a rabbit in that karate tournament.

Stewie:
 That's weird, you're doing reverse cutaways now?

Stewie:
 You know, that chicken's kid is in my preschool class. I don't really want to be friends with him, but he knows a lot of chicks. And backwards rim shot.

Stewie:
 My God, why is there vomit everywhere?

Brian:
 Is that the ipecac bottle? Oh, no! No, please, not this.

Stewie:
 Oh God...it's not gonna be coming out of us, it's gonna be going...!!HHEEOOOOO

Brian:
 OH DEAR GOD...!!HHEEOOOOO Ohh! Oh..! [splat!] Ow, what the hell?! [Peter goes back to Brian to hold back his ears.]

Peter:
 !!!HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHEEEELLL

Stewie:
 I don't want it I don't want anot !!HHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLHU

Chris:
 Dad, I'm scared! !!!LLLLLLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG

Stewie:
 Oh God, this is so disgusting I think I'm gonna puke! HUHLEEEEEEEEHH! !HHEEEEEEEELHUH Fuck!

Brian:
 Stewie, I don't care what it takes, we've got to fix this! WE JUST ATE SO MUCH VOMIT!

Chris:
 Oh, boy! A baby! I saw my Spanish teacher leave one of you in a trash can!

Brian:
 My God, it's the Greased-up Deaf Guy running backwards toward that greased truck explosion!

up Deaf Guy:
 Oh, the gwee buwn so ba'! I can't he!

up Hearing Guy:
 [normal voice, looking at his watch] Boy, I am late for that meeting.

Brian:
 Come on math, you dick.

Mort Goldman:
 Oh, look a quarter! Who cares what that doctor found on my nuts? This is a good day!

Brian:
 Hey, I couldn't imagine life without ya, buddy.

Stewie:
 Y'know, I forgot what a mancave I had in Lois' uterus. While I was waiting for you, I was shooting pool. Had to hold the cue at weird angles, but still...

Chris:
 You guys heard the baby talkin' in there, didn't you?

Peter:
 Dammit I hate these new stairs!

Peter:
 Ow ow fuck fuck fuck!

Tom Tucker:
 Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker. This just in: Wanted fugitive, Bobby "The Shirt" Briggs, notorious for always wearing shirts while committing his crimes, has finally been caught after 15 years on the lam. A police spokesperson was quoted as saying, "Duh, I'm a dumb cop. I like to give Tom Tucker a ticket." I was going, like, 41.

Peter:
 Let's use our eyes... to see.

Peter:
 Quagmire and I'll help you bring this guy to justice!

Quagmire:
 [through clenched teeth] Peter, what'd I say about you volunteering me for shit?

Quagmire:
 Joe, hold your handcuffs over my lap. [Joe unzips Quagmire and looks at Quagmire's penis]

Joe:
 What the hell is that?

Quagmire:
 Swiss army penis. [breaks Joe's handcuffs]

Joe:
 Whoa Quagmire, that's incredible.

Quagmire:
 Peter. [fails to break Peter's handcuffs] Your's are made of stronger metal. We're gonna have to go with acetylene torch penis. [welding sounds are heard] Don't look right into it. My STD's help it burn brighter.

Peter:
 Hey Quagmire, you uh... you ever been in Atlantic City before?

Quagmire:
 Once, about 20 years ago, why?

Giant Bird:
 What's goin on in here?

Founding Father:
 N...nothing. Just bellyaching about the British.

Giant Bird:
 Get back to warmin those eggs.

Kevin:
 And then we dug the bullets out of that Iraqi family's skulls so they couldn't be traced back to us.

Susie:
 'Today I saw a balloon.'

Cop:
 Hey, you're not in uniform. Are you guys cops?

Peter:
 Are you guys cops?

Cop:
 They know we're not cops!

South America:
 Hmm, lotta black guys over there.

Africa:
 Hey man, where you goin?

South America:
 I'll be back, I'm comin back, I'll be right back.

Gayjacker:
 This plane's goin to Miami!

Peter:
 Hey I got an idea, let's make scalding asphalt angels. Ow ow, ow ow, ow ow! Second-degree burns, first-degree fun.

Quagmire:
 Joe, you have blood just pouring out of your pant leg.

Joe:
 Yeah, I had a ball blown in the river.

Peter:
 Clean that up, you idiot. Love you!

Peter:
 Now remember, I love you just the way you are. And besides, there's nothing wrong with being 35.

Lois:
 Peter, I'm 43.

Peter:
 Get out of this house.

Peter:
 I'm gonna get our old mom back! Brian, keys! Chris, beer! Meg, UG-LAAAAAY!!!!

Security Guard:
 Sorry, you're not allowed in here.

Lois:
 Oh yeah? [lifts up her shirt]

Security Guard:
 I'm not into that.

Lois:
 Oh. Well, what are you into?

Security Guard:
 Pinkberry.

Security Guard:
 I love my job! Yum yum yum yum yum yum.

Lois:
 No Peter, I don't want to act my age and you don't want that either. Otherwise, you wouldn't have called me an old plowhorse!

Peter:
 Look, I didn't mean to say that. I was a jerk.

Stewie:
 Oh my God, Super Mario? What are you doing here?

Mario:
 I jump on a turtle, Stewie. It's not an exciting life, but it's my life.

Peter:
 You do make me happy, Lois. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me.

Lois:
 Honey, give me any laundry you have. I'm doing a diapers and Meg load.

Quagmire:
 How're you girls doin on popcorn?

Quagmire:
 Here ya go.

Meg:
 Just putting on my lipstick! [shaves, cuts] Dammit!

Stewie:
 Rupert did you hear that? Meg's boyfriend is in love with me. Not that I care, I mean, it won't matter once I explain to him what's going on with us. But what would I tell him is going on with us?

Stewie:
 Dear God, I have a shoe appointment in the morning and I want to be fresh!

 Hartman:
 Yeah that's... that's not supposed to be there so, she should probably always wear a hat.

Lois:
 Oh, I wouldn't worry about it Bonnie. I've put Stewie in the oven a buncha times. As long as you come to your senses in 15 minutes, everything's fine.

Peter:
 Lois, can I go slip'n'slide in the yard?

Peter:
 Yes. Almost.

Lois:
 OK, I just wanna be sure you don't get a cramp.

Lois:
 Meg, are you asking... whether it's appropriate for a girl to ask a boy out on a date? Of course it's appropriate! It's also sad and desperate and I would never do it, but you're not me, are you, sweetie?

Meg:
 Bye, Patty. Bye, Esther. Bye, overzealous Asian kids lining up to be the first ones in school tomorrow.

Stewie:
 Hey! It's 10:30! I suggest you take your dope and go elsewhere!

Meg:
 Chris, please just sleep with Kent, and then tell me all about it.

Meg:
 [Regarding Kent] Come on, Chris; he'll do all the work.

Chris:
 I said no, Meg!

Meg:
 I'll pay you $100.

Chris:
 Oh, fine. I'll keep it in my bum; there'll be plenty of room. That's my sarcastic way of saying it's not gonna happen!

Quagmire:
 Roofies, huh? Pretty big pill for such a little girl.

Meg:
 Yeah, I know, but I asked someone to do me a favor, and they're not too keen on doing it.

Quagmire:
 Oh, I know what they're for, honey.

Quagmire:
 Call me if you get arrested.

Meg:
 I will. Thanks.

Stewie:
 Clothes sure are a prison, aren't they?

Stewie:
 What's this? Ooh, candy!

Stewie:
 Do either of you know what poison ivy looks like?

Announcer:
 We now return to Breaking Bad.

Voice:
 You will recommend Breaking Bad to everyone you know.

Peter:
 I will recommend Breaking Bad to everyone I know.

Voice:
 Breaking Bad is the best show you've ever seen, except maybe The Wire.

Peter:
 Breaking Bad is the best show I've ever seen, except maybe The Wire.

Voice:
 You will never stop talking about Breaking Bad or The Wire.

Peter:
 I will never stop talking about Breaking Bad or The Wire.

Peter:
 Aw cool! Hey c'mon Brian, try it with me. [both enter. Guide closes door]

Brian:
 AAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!! [both exit with heads in opposite bodies]

Peter:
 We were talkin about Meg. We call her Chris so she doesn't know.

Meg:
 [off-camera] Fuck you!

Peter:
 Shut up Chris!

Peter:
 A week ago we call him stupid and now he's given tours at a space shuttle. Negative reinforcement, that's the key. [kicks Stewie] Right, stupid?

Lois:
 Everyone strap yourselves in! Stewie, hold my hand!

Stewie:
 No thank you, I prefer to die giving you the finger.

Meg:
 [Touring the shuttle with Chris] So, do you know how all of this stuff works?

Brian:
 You know what? You only live once. I am sticking my head out the window. [he does] YES! THIS IS THE BEST VERSION OF WHATEVER'S SO ENJOYABLE ABOUT THIS!

Brian:
 We're slowing down. That's a good sign.

Peter:
 You know what's not slowing down? Breaking Bad. Haven't seen anything like it since The Wire.

Stewie:
 God, he never shuts up about those shows.

Stewie:
 Sounds like someone got her vibrator working again.

Chris:
 Stop making fun of me! I just wanted to listen to you guys having sex, but you were saying mean things about me!

Peter:
 If radio DJs have taught me anything about radio, it's that you gotta do two things: turn it up and rip the knob off!

Stewie:
 Hey, Brian.

Brian:
 Oh, hey, Stewie.

Stewie:
 Listen, have you seen my play?

Brian:
 You know, Stewie, I have seen your play, and it is exhilarating. A child's play is one of the most beautiful things in the world. Continue to play, little one. You are our future.

Stewie:
 What the fuck are you talking about? The play I wrote. Have you seen it?

Stewie:
 You tried to destroy it, didn't you? I knew my play was good, just like I knew your play was a mediocre patchwork of hackneyed ideas and tired clich s. You have no idea how hard it was to sit in that theater with all those braying hyenas. Couldn't you tell something was up when Chris and the fat man could follow the plot? I mean, it took Peter a year to figure out Stuart Little.

Stewie:
 It's filled with terrible double entendres, puns and stolen bits. There's a line in there from Seinfeld.

Stewie:
 I have a voice. You understand that? A writer needs a voice and I have one. You don't. Your play panders to the lowest common denominator, Brian. And it doesn't even do that well!

Tom Tucker:
 I'm Tom Tucker, damn it! I make more in an hour than you make in two hours!

 Stewie:
 You know I want to live in New York City when I'm older, 'cause it's twinkly and big, and this is where dreams come true, and that giant bird's coming for us, isn't he?

Stewie:
 I don't wear anything I can't take off with a flourish.

Lois:
 Remember kids, if it's terrible, at the end we all say, "You did it!"

David Mamet:
 It was a Goddamn fucking piece of shit on a dick!

Peter:
 Where will you two be going on your scummymoon? And can I plan your bridal golden shower?

Quagmire:
 I guess I'm just going to have to suck it up.

Peter:
 Let her suck it up, she's the expert. Sorry, keep going.

Lois:
 Welcome to our home, Charmese. Sit anywhere you like. That chair with the garbage bag taped over it looks pretty good.

Stewie:
 Meg, you look pretty next to her.

Charmese:
 Unfortunately, I can't have children.

Lois:
 Oh, menopause?

Charmese:
 No, I got knifed in the vagina one Christmas.

Brian:
 Ah, the holidays are always stressful.

Quagmire:
 What the fuck is going on with my life?

Peter:
 I'm not just a poorly cleaned butt. There's a whole man around it you have to please.

Charmese:
 Look, Glenn, you're obviously not gay.

Quagmire:
 [stammering] Yes, I am!

Peter:
 Well, I'm something 'cause I've been at full sail for the last half-hour.

Peter:
 Hey, Quagmire, why is the red light blinkin' on your computer?

Stewie:
 What are we watching? Glee?

Lois:
 Peter, breakfast for dinner is anarchy!

Peter:
 Was Beowulf a Teen Wolf sequel with Scott Baio?

Peter:
 [Sighs] Then I just totally failed that Medieval Lit. midterm.

 Hartman:
 Charmese, when's the last time you had a pelvic exam?

Charmese:
 When was the Missouri Compromise?

 Hartman:
 I think 1821.

Charmese:
 Then I've never had a pelvic exam.

Charmese:
 I would like to pawn all these clothes for crack money.

Charmese:
 Hey. Let's do it.

Quagmire:
 What, you mean, like, sex?

Charmese:
 Yeah, and we should go now; I just stuffed everything back into place.

Charmese:
 I haven't gone two weeks without sex since I was in a coma for six weeks.

Charmese:
 Gay men don't watch straight porn!

Charmese:
 I'm sorry my urine melted a hole through your toilet.

Stewie:
 Oh, Brian, there you are. Look, I've been thinking about your situation with women and I believe I've come up with a way to get to the source of the problem. Follow me.

Brian:
 What's going on? Oh, my God.

Brian:
 Stewie, what the hell?! These are all my ex-girlfriends!

Stewie:
 Well, I thought they could provide some insights that might improve your love life. Ladies, as you may have guessed, you are here because you have all dated this great guy. Yet, somehow, things didn't work out. My objective is to figure out why.

Rita:
 I don't know. The word "self-absorbed" comes to mind.

Carolyn:
 And pretentious.

Jillian:
 And he's got a big Eggo!

Stewie:
 Okay, we seem to have a theme going here.

Brian:
 Oh, come on! You're all just mad because I didn't want to be with you!

Ida:
 I think Brian's a wonderful man. He's just having a difficult time coming to terms with his own sexuality.

Brian:
 Shut up, Ida.

Stewie:
 She's my favorite.

Cheryl Tiegs:
 He's insecure.

Brooke:
 And he's got a tiny penis.

Stewie:
 Yeah, that was pretty clear by the survey. Okay, now who wants more wine.

Ida:
 This is great. We should do this every Saturday.

Brian:
 No, no, we're not going to do this every Saturday!

Rita:
 What's wrong? We're just being honest.

Brian:
 Oh, oh, you want honest? [points to Rita] You're an old bag, [points to Kate] you're blind, [points to Brooke] your vomit tastes weird, [points to Jillian] you don't even know why you're here, [points to Lauren Conrad] you chose to be on The Hills, [points to Ida] you still have bits of penis left, [points to something off screen] and you can never get wet!

Brian:
 [points to Stewie] And you?! You're more of a woman than anyone else in this room!

Stewie:
 Get him!

Stewie:
 NONE OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS WHAT HAPPENED!!!

Brian:
 Jeeze, you kiss your mother with that mouth?

Stewie:
 No, but I'm ready for therapy.

Lois:
 You know, Peter, since it's Valentine's Day, I thought we should do something we've never done before.

Peter:
 Release the virus?

 Herbert:
 Oh, hey there, Chris! Happy Valentine's Day! Hope Cupid brings you a saggy bag of treats!

Lois:
 That was a fun birthday party, huh Stewie?

Chris:
 Sorry!

Herbert:
 You really know how to waste a Cialis, don't you?

Chris:
 No way! That was the last thing on your list! I can't do this anymore.

Meg:
 Well, maybe you should have thought about that before you stole mom's money. I own you. Now, here's my post office key. I need you to go down town and get my stuff from my P.O box.

Chris:
 Y...You don't get your mail here?

Meg:
 No. I get a lot of stuff from the Netherlands.

Chris:
 Like what?

Meg:
 Like I'm part of a group that sorta trashes Anne Frank's house every year.

Chris:
 You know what? No. That's it! I'm no...I'm not doing anymore of your crap, Meg.

Meg:
 Chris, don't you see? You have no choice. I'll just go tell mom and dad about the money, and they'll ground your ass for a YEAR!

Chris:
 I don't care! Tell em'! 'cause I'm not gonna be here! I'm gonna run away and no one will ever see me again!

Meg:
 Good! Go! And who's even gonna miss you? You're just a little thief!! Where ya goin' Chris? Who are you gonna turn to? You don't even have any friends!

Chris:
 Hi, I ran away from home. Do you mind if I live with you?

Herbert:
 Live with me?! My goodness, I have pinch myself to see if I'm dreamin'! [Herbert pinches his right arm, which bruises all over the arm] Hot dog! It's real!

Herbert:
 I thought I told you to clean up in here. And why aren't you dressed? We're supposed to have dinner with Judge Maynard and Timmy.

Chris:
 Yeah, okay, as soon as I finish this level.

Herbert:
 No, get your coat on. It's a three-hour drive to that cabin.

Chris:
 Can't you just cook something here?

Herbert:
 Excuse me?! I am not going to cook you dinner while you sit here in your own mess playing your TV games!

Chris:
 Oh-ho, and the martyr returns!

Herbert:
 Chris, I... I think it's time for you to go.

Chris:
 Okay, I'll go. But I want you to know, I faked all my light-headedness. Mm, Kool-Aid. Whoa, whoa. Sound familiar?!

Robert Loggia:
 Eight fucking hours later!

Peter:
 I'll be on the lookout for great tits.

Brian:
 Actually, Lois, that's a species of bird that's known to frequent domestic birdhouses.

Peter:
 Hey Lois, let's go outside and see if we can find some great tits. Cause there certainly ain't any in here!

Chris:
 Remember those two we saw last night? One was bigger than the other!

Peter:
 Yeah, and the bigger one had a hair sticking out of that pointy thing. What do you call that pointy thing again?

Chris:
 The beak?

Peter:
 Oh, okay.

Lois:
 We have no money!

Peter:
 Well that's okay, Lois. We got a wonderful family.

Lois:
 No, we don't. There's Meg, and Dummy, and Bighead.

Lois:
 Hi. My name's... Classy. What can I do for you, hotstuff?

Mort:
 Ooh, hi, Classy. Listen, do you have a wallet or a purse?

Lois:
 I have a purse.

Mort:
 Oh, oh baby. I want you to take the money out and count it really slowly.

Lois:
 Okay. One.

Mort:
 Ooh! That's nice!

Lois:
 Two.

Mort:
 Oh! Oh my!

Lois:
 I'm sorry, the next bill I have in here is a ten.

Mort:
 Oh! Oh I love you! All that and everything!

Lois:
 There's a lot of crazy things I let Peter get away with. I even held my tongue when he went through that anime phase.

Peter:
 Hey Lois, me make drive time to Super Fun Clam with Noble Quagmire and Wheel Monster Joe. Go force!

Peter:
 Meg, I want you to have this sad-sounding fart.

Peter:
 I love you too, Lois. By the way, you may have to become a full-on prostitute because our phone bill was $7,000.

Lois:
 Peter, I want you to do me so hard that we have to change churches!

Peter:
 Aw, that beef bowl is wreckin' me. My stomach feels like that time I had explosive diarrhea.

Peter:
 [on the phone] Is dinner almost ready?

Peter:
 [as Peter is about to be impaled on a spire] Oh, fuck! The cock-sucking ground!

Quagmire:
 Whoa, is that Harrison Ford?

Peter:
 Yeah, it says in the brochures that he assists with all the jumps.

Harrison Ford:
 Get off my plane!

Peter:
 You know who'd look funny wearing one of those? The Monopoly guy!

Mahmoud:
 Correct! Go directly to jail and convert to Islam!

Peter:
 Hahaha, because they do that!

Mahmoud:
 Yes, that is what I intended.

Bob Costas:
 I'm Bob Costas, here with Boston Marathon winner Peter Griffin. Peter, how did you do it?

Peter:
 Bob, I just got in my car and drove it. And when there was a guy in my way, I killed him.

Peter:
 Oh, guilty is the other one? [exasperated] Well I don't know.

Peter:
 Until I'm not angry anymore, you naked buncha bitches!

Peter:
 Enough! ...was a movie with Jennifer Lopez that did not live to expectations.

Joyce:
 Our top story. Guys, right?

Quagmire:
 It's his fault we're still here. How is it that you think you know everything anyway? You don't even understand your feelings for the mailman.

Brian:
 You motherfucker! Get outta here, I'll kill you! But come back tomorrow, same time, I get very sad on Sundays when you're not here.

Carter Pewterschmidt:
 Now you're all gonna have to witness me taking an old man pill that looks way too big to swallow.

Carter Pewterschmidt:
 Oh, there we go.

Quagmire:
 And now to take my position. This is what I call the butterpat.

Stewie:
 There's a maniac out there! He's cutting people's power off, breaking into their homes and slitting their throats!

Stewie:
 And we're dead.

Quagmire:
 This is ridiculous! Even if you don't believe the note was legitimate, there was an eyewitness who saw the entire thing!

Brian:
 Well, I have questions about her testimony. She said she was at a party. Not just any party, a sex party! How could a woman at an orgy witness a murder? The bedroom was of a hundred feet from the window!

Quagmire:
 Okay, first of all, the term 'orgy' is outdated. We call them 'genital jamborees'.

Brian:
 But still, I don't see how she could look out a window and witness a crime!

Quagmire:
 Trust me, you're banging eight strangers who responded to a flyer. At some point, you're gonna look out a window and question every decision you've ever made.

Carter Pewterschmidt:
 Mayor West has let people down!

Peter:
 Guys, I feel like all we talk about is Mayor West.

Judge:
 Jurors, you have now heard all the facts of this case. I remind you that because we are a small town, many of you may have ties with the defendant or the victim. You must set aside these personal connections and render an impartial and unanimous verdict. Does anyone have any questions?

Peter:
 Yeah, is Toblerone the fanciest thing in the world?

Pope:
 Hi. I don't know who to complain to about this, but I keep getting XVIII's mail. Yeah, no, no, he's not here anymore. This is XXIV. Yeah. No, I don't need Newsweek. No, I don't need National Geographic. Yeah...I...No, I'll...I'll hang onto Boy's Life.

Peter:
 What the hell kind of dog is that?

Roger:
 I was going to ask you the same thing.

Hank Hill:
 Ahh, dammit. I always wake up before I find out if they can understand the baby.

Peter:
 Lift up the shades, there's a man on the wing! [Joe lifts up the shades] It's me. I'm the man on the wing.

Joe:
 Peter, how the hell did you get out there?! Are you crazy?!

Chris:
 Dad, why can't we all go?

Peter:
 Because, somebody's gotta stay here and round up all these rattlesnakes.

Peter:
 Bye!

Quagmire:
 I don't know if I can pull out of this, Giggity.

Lois:
 Who threw out my sequin top?

Stewie:
 You're 43, accept it!

Stewie:
 You... look... fat.

Peter:
 I always wanted to go to Canada, but then South Park went, so we couldn't go.

Lois:
 Peter, come on, it's time to wake up. You gotta get to work.

Peter:
 [In a deep voice] Uh, Lois, I ain't feeling good.

Lois:
 Peter, what happened to your voice? It's so deep.

Peter:
 I think I'm sick.

Lois:
 Well, you don't sound like yourself. In fact, you sound kinda hot.

Peter:
 I just threw up two chicken gyros out my nose. They're on your side of the bed.

Joe:
 I heard you coming.

Peter:
 Fletcher met the long arm of the law at the wrong end of a shotgun in the deep end of a grave at the far end of a dead end road.

Quagmire:
 Happy fucking birthday, Mikey! [Kicks his birthday cake] Yeah!

Chris:
 Mom! Stewie's dead!

Peter:
 Excuse me, which one was Lindsay Lohan's dessert fork?

Bus Boy:
 I think it was that one.

Peter:
 [licks the fork, then starts bleeding] Gimme cocaine!

Quagmire:
 Move over, funny man Richard Lewis, we got Richard Lois.

Brian:
 Can't you give that giraffe at home another chance? You know, for every one they sell, they save a giraffe in the wild.

Giraffe Rescuer:
 Sorry giraffes, they only bought one. [returns the giraffe] Nah, they returned it.

Stewie:
 Recall room, Brian. Nothing works in here.

Lois:
 Dr. Hartman, is Peter gonna be okay?

 Hartman:
 One more person asks me about a patient today, I'm gonna scream.

Chris:
 Hey Meg, who's your date? He looks like a real stiff.

Jerome:
 What's up, fools? I'd like to dedicate my performance today to Miss Whitney Houston.

Quagmire:
 Oh, we are fucked.

s Mom:
 Jeffrey Lipsitz has two soccer medals.

Mort:
 I can't play soccer... I have newborn-calf ankles! You know this, damn it!

Peter:
 Sorry, I struck out looking. Wait, you're not the kid I promised.

Kid:
 No, he died last night.

Peter:
 Aw. Phew.

Peter:
 I am the Wind Maker [shoots the monkey in front of him] and I shoot monkeys now.

Peter:
 Quagmire, when a girl says she doesn't want to have sex with you do you take that as an answer?

Meg:
 Is there a bathroom in here? I've been yo-yo-ing a turd for the last twenty minutes.

Chris:
 Meg, they're dead. Would you stop being so uptight? You're like one of those Asian-Americans who fought in Vietnam.

Vietnamese man:
 Ohh, it's just me.

Meg:
 Where is the dead body? I know you took it. And don't lie, or I'll tell Jennifer Connelly that you're the one who's been mailing her those dog heads.

Chris:
 Uh, yes, I'd like to mail this to a whore.

Stewie:
 Hey, guys, what's goin' on? And no one says anything, which means they hate it.

Meg:
 Stop it!

Chris:
 I have a itch.

Meg:
 I don't care! Dead people don't scratch their balls!

Chris:
 Meg, though you cannot tell, I am frowning.

Lois:
 I can't believe Horace is dead.

Stewie:
 I can't believe we left Brian in the car with the windows up.

Brian:
 I'm gonna pee!

Lois:
 I forgot you don't even know your ass from a hole in the ground.

Peter:
 Son of a bitch! They also stole my sense of wonder.

Peter:
 You know, it's hard for me to take the things you say seriously when I know what's been in your mouth.

Peter:
 Um, a farm? It's where vegetables live.

Peter:
 And Meg, you yourself said "Lip Gloss, unicorns, Channing Tatum, something, something, bullcrap."

Meg:
 You were listening the whole time?

Stewie:
 Aw! He packed a guitar? What a douche!

Peter:
 Hang on, guys, it might just be the Tasmanian Devil.

Stewie:
 I think we should clean this place up, it's a 'meth'! Brian? Oh yeah, he's at college.

Peter:
 I want to show my kids what it looks like when a bitch dies!

Chris:
 I have a crossbow!

Peter:
 Chris has a crossbow.

Peter:
 Hey, I thought I told you kids to go plow in the field.

Chris:
 But Dad, we've been plowing all morning.

Meg:
 Yeah, I can't take any more plowing. I can barely walk.

Peter:
 Look, I know it seems like dirty work, but Chris, you've got to spread that seed until your sack is empty, and Meg, you've got to clear that brush so he can plant it deep where it needs to be.

Chris:
 Okay, we'll keep at it, but I think that hoe is pretty much worn out.

Peter:
 Well, flip it over, you can use both sides.

Lois:
 Crime? I've never noticed this in Quahog.

Stewie:
 You're in the house fourteen hours a day. What would you notice?

Peter:
 [To Brian] Hey, congratulations, buddy. You know, you're a lucky guy. The only thing I ever won was an extra day of summer.

Lois:
 Okay, Peter. One more day.

Peter:
 Yay!!

Peter:
 I saw what I look like in a car window, and now I don't wanna go.

Brian:
 Oh my God Stewie, it worked! We're in Vegas.

Stewie:
 Yeahhh, alright! So let's hit the hospital, get checked out for teleportation cancer and then part-tyyyy!

Stewie:
 You see that Brian, that's going to be our penises later, right?

Peter:
 Scissors are jerks. And I'm a' owl.

Brian:
 Excuse me, where can I find some smoking Asians? Oh, everywhere? Okay.

Unlucky Stewie:
 I've got a bad feeling, Brian.

Lucky Stewie:
 I've got a good feeling, Brian.

Peter:
 I'm gonna get me that honey.

Brian and Stewie:
 1...2...3!

Stewie:
 I'm sorry I can't, I want to live! I didn't really think we were going to do it!

Brian:
 [falling] You dick!

Stewie:
 Well, the porn's free and they have a continental breakfast! [reads it again] Oh wait, the continent's Africa.

Peter:
 I did it! I'm gonna be on TV!

Picture of his ancestor:
 Did you kill the others?

Peter:
 I shan't!

Picture of his ancestor:
 You must.

Peter:
 [sighs] I'm gonna go talk to the statue in the basement.

Statue:
 Did you kill the painting?

Peter:
 This place is a nuthouse.

Peter:
: Well, there goes my music career. I wonder I could get my old job back painting kids faces at birthday parties.

Peter:
 There you go, Timmy.

Man:
 Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You're just drawing penises with a Sharpie on children's faces.

Peter:
 I don't know how to draw a cat.

Stewie:
 Hey Brian, [Indicating Meg] "Megs Benedict."

Lois:
 Hey everyone, I made brownies!

Stewie:
 I better hurry up, or I'm gonna miss the show!

Lois:
 [sobbing after eating all the brownies] What did I do? What did I do? [vomits]

Stewie:
 I love brownie day!

Peter:
 [to Lois] I want you on my team for everything...except for sports.

Herbert:
  [in mining gear] I dig kids.

Chris:
 But why are there THREE of them?!

Tricia:
 [Dressed as Lois] I will have one scoop of mint chocolate chip in a waffle cone.

Peter:
 You are a practical, straight-forward people.

Peter:
 [to Lois] Can you forgive me? Chris forgave me.

Chris:
 [holding an ice pack on his black eye] I can't wait until you fall asleep tonight.

Meg:
 [trying to put down the car window] Dad, it smells like rotting flesh in here! Take the window lock off.

Peter:
 Can't do that, Meg. I don't trust myself not to jump out the window.

Peter:
 [arriving at Old Block Island Cemetery with Lois] Damn it Lois, they're already here! This is all your fault!

Lois:
 What? How is this my fault?

Peter:
 Because you just had to stop for ice cream, then you get in there and you order like you never heard of food before!

Lois:
 Oh, coffee fudge swirl with Reese's peanut butter cups. Oh, I wonder what's in that.

Peter:
 You just listed off all the ingredients! Everything you just said is what's in that!

Peter:
 Suzuki Samurai: ninja name, garbage car.

Joe:
 This dugout is mine! You hear me?!

Bruce:
 Well, you can take that bat and shove it up my ass mister.

Peter:
 [devising a plan to enter the Clam] This is worse than the time we were in the Clam right now. [Peter and Lois appear inside the Clam] Yes!

Peter:
 [after learning the treasure is an expired coupon] Um, this sucks worse than when I went to the strip club without Lois. [appears at a strip club] Yay!

Peter:
 [after hearing a knock at the door] No way that's the shrimp!

Peter:
 Hey, I'm home. I got groceries.

Peter:
 Yeah, I was driving past there and we were out of some stuff, so I...

Lois:
 [tackles Peter] You listen to me, you son of a bitch! I've got one thing in this lifetime! One thing! [punches Peter]

Peter:
 You always say I never do anything around here!

Lois:
 Yeah, I like saying that more than I like you doing things!

Chris:
 Dad, I got the rest from the car. Where...

Peter:
 Chris, run! You were right, she didn't appreciate it!

Chris:
 Oh crap! [Runs off, Lois throws a can at him] Ow!

Lois:
 That's right. I do groceries!

Peter:
 Hey Lois, are you sure this place is for men?

Lois:
 Yes, Peter. It's for everyone.

Peter:
 Really? 'Cause this kinda looks like a dress.

Lois:
 Peter, it's fine. Come on out. [Peter complies, Lois takes a picture of him in a dress] Ha, you gaybo!

Peter:
 Lois, I weigh the same 293 pounds today that I weighed in grade school.

 Hartman:
 Nurse, have somebody fix that clock. It's very distracting.

Stewie:
 Brian! Browser history! Clear it!

 Hartman:
 Mr. Griffin, you re a lucky man. If it weren t for Chip here, you would have lost your leg. The bad news is we did an X-Ray, and your body is full of a spooky skeleton man.

Quagmire:
 That's my word, that's my word!

Joe:
 Quagmire, you in there!?

Peter:
 Oh, he's eating. [Shouts at the door] We'll come back when you're done eating!

Stewie:
 [to Brian] Brian, either you cooperate or I blow my Adam Levine dog whistle.

Adam Levine:
 Hey, my voice isn't that high.

Stewie:
 [to audience viewer] It is. It is though.

Brian:
 Oh my God! Oh my God! [Brian howls] Peter! Peter! You hear that? [Brian howls] I'm matching the sound. [Brian howls, then runs around in a circle] Is what I'm doing helping?

Peter:
 [slurring] Okay, Joe, Joe, you're drunk. Okay, you're drunk. Gimme your keys. And...and I'm drunk, so I'll give you my keys. Okay, now we're both good to drive home.

Peter:
 You been drinkin' tonight, sir?

Joe:
 No, officer, I just had a glass of dinner with my wine.

Peter:
 Okay, I'munna needja ta step outta the car an' walk a straight line, please.

Peter:
 Alright, you be safe, sir. There's a lotta crazies out there tonight.

Peter:
 Oh. Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Quagmire.

Ida:
 Hi, Peter. I'm a little worried about Glenn. I haven't heard from him in days. Have you seen him?

Peter:
 I haven't seen anybody. I've been grounded for pinching a girl.

Joe:
 Hey, are you guys talking about Quagmire? He never showed this morning, and today's the day we usually go apple picking.

Joe:
 Get that one. Get that one. Hey, get that one. Get that one over there. No, not that one!

Quagmire:
 I already got it! I can't put it back!

Joe:
 Well, it's not going in the pie.

Quagmire:
 Well, if you're so smart, why don't you come up here and pick them yourself!?

Joe:
 Aaaaand now there's no pie at all!

Meg:
 He's going to kill me! I can already picture my funeral!

Peter:
 Thanks, didn't want to pay for the hole.

Meg:
 Chris; you have my back, right?

Chris:
 I don't know, let me check. [lifts up his shirt and sees his back covered with bacne] Yeah.

Peter:
 Hey, Brian, can you come here a sec?

Brian:
 Sure, Peter, what's up?

Peter:
 You're a well-read guy, right?

Brian:
 Well, I don't know. I guess when I read my Henry David, I tend to be pretty Thoreau.

Brian:
 Ah, cold. Well, it worked, thanks for your help, Stewie.

Stewie:
 If I knew you were actually going to do it, I wouldn't have suggested it. You look like my foot that time Lois made my bath too hot.

Meg:
 Oh, fudge!

Voice:
 Only I didn't say "fudge", I said "fuck."

Student:
 [Meg gets pretty face by Michael's punch] He punched her pretty! [Michael punches Meg back to normal face] Oh, he punched her ugly again!

Consulate Employee:
 Not only did you destroy your passports, you renounced your citizenship.

Brian:
 When did we do that?

Peter:
 Oh, I did that on the Italian social networking site, "Shut-up-a-you-facebook".

Stewie:
 Stop what you're doing!

Peter:
 Me too. We haven't done it like that since we were engaged but allowed to sleep with other people.

Stewie:
 [Sitting near the hem of Peter's robe on the floor] He's wearing a rubber.

Stewie:
 Well, if we're going to be Italian I guess we should start murdering our brothers.

Stewie:
 [In an Italian-accented whisper] You break-a my heart Chris. You break-a my heart.

Peter:
 Come on, Lois, I got a 90-percenter goin', it could go either way, let's start making choices.

Consulate Employee:
 Now if you will, please sing the national anthem of the United States.

Brian:
 You've... you've given me a wonderful life... I love you all.

Brian:
 Damn it, Stewie, what the hell did you do?!

Brian:
 Thanks to you, the Indians killed all the white people and took over America. I mean, you're the one who's  always saying, "Never alter the past".

Stewie:
 Brian, look out! Gah, Brian!

Lois:
 Oh my God! Brian! Brian, can you hear me?!

Peter:
 Holy crap, what the hell happened?!

Squirrel:
 [As he kicks Brian's head] That guy sucked!

Stewie:
 Oh, dear, Rupert. Without those capacitors, it'll be completely impossible to build a functioning time machine. I guess that means Brian is ... really gone for good.

Peter:
 Hoo boy, this is probably the worst pain I've ever had to go through.  And I've sprained my ankle twice.  Um, the truth is Brian wasn't just my dog, he was my best friend in the whole world.  He was smart, he was loyal, and... I guess what I'm trying to say is, he was like a brother to me. And I'm gonna spend the rest of my life missing him.

Lois:
 We're all gonna miss him, Peter. We're all gonna miss him very much.

Vinny:
 What's the matter?

Stewie:
 Fine! D'you wanna know what's the matter?! You're the matter! Everyone in this family is so damn thrilled with you they forgot all about Brian! Well, I'm not thrilled! I'll never forget Brian! He was my best friend! You're not supposed to lose your best friend at my age! You're not supposed to lose him ever!

Vinny:
 Look, Stewie, I know it doesn't seem like it now, but you're gonna be okay.

Stewie:
 Yeah, right! How do you know?

Vinny:
 Because, I once had a thing, ih, happen to me with some stuff.

Stewie:
 Really? That's what's happening to me! Stuff!

Vinny:
 Y'know, before you guys found me in the shop, I lived with an old man named Leo. It was just him and me in a tiny apartment and we got pretty tight. He kinda became my whole world. By da time he passed away, it was real toff.

Stewie:
 So...wuh-how did he die?

Vinny:
 He tried ta go to a yoga class, and on da first pose, his ball-sack split in half.

Vinny:
 Yeah, it was on Dateline, it was a whole thing. Anyway, I guess Leo was kinda like my Brian.

Stewie:
 Well, so how'd you get over him?

Vinny:
 Well, I met your family in the pet store. When I saw you guys lookin' for a dog, I kinda sensed you were goin' tru da same feelin's o' loss dat I was. And it made me think, "Hey, maybe I was meant ta find dees guys. Maybe we were meant to be together."

Stewie:
 You know what, Vinny? I'm starting to think that may be true.

Vinny:
 Heh-heh! Bring it in, Stewie!

Lois:
 Oh my God, I almost served Brian again. I can't believe he's been gone a whole month.

Stewie:
 Can't we at least get rid of the doggy door so Chris doesn't keep getting stuck in it?

Chris:
 Everyday, I get a little further in.

Vinny:
 Hey you, what's your name?

Chris:
 Chris.

Vinny:
 How 'bout I call you "hat-boy".

Chris:
 Hell yeah!

Lois:
 Lower your voice, Chris.

Chris:
 It's Hat-boy, bitch!

Chris:
 [yelling to Peter and Quagmire] Guys, I'm trying to do something up here that works better if I don't hear men singing.

Quagmire:
 What was Simon without Garfunkel?

Quagmire:
 [extending his hand] Put 'er there!

Mort:
 No, I've seen your prescriptions. Let's just say we're doing it.

Peter:
 Well Mort, I hope I can trust you. I've been lied to before.

Peter:
 Well, I'm off to work. Bye guys, love you!

Chris:
 Love you, too!

Stewie:
 Love you, Pop!

Lois:
 Bye, love you!

Chris:
 He bought it!

Stewie:
 What an idiot!

Lois:
 I hate him so much, I'm shakin'!

Lois:
 Peter, I don't like what success is doin' to you!

Peter:
 Yeah? Well I don't like what time is doin' to you. [points to Lois' breasts] Droop, droop. [points to Lois' vagina and imitates an explosion] Hey Chris, you ready with my luggage?

Lois:
 Luggage? For what?!

Peter:
 We're goin' on tour, Lois.

Chris:
 Here you go, Dad. I emptied this out so it'd be easier to carry.

Lois:
 You're gonna have to choose between music and family.

Peter:
 If I choose family, does it have to be this family?

Lois:
 Yes Peter, this family!

Peter:
 I feel kinda bad leavin' the family like this with Thanksgiving comin' up. I mean, if I'm not there, who's gonna carve the turkey?

Lois:
 I don't understand!

Vinny:
 Hey, whose leg do you gotta gagoosh to get an Amaretto Disaronno around here?

Stewie:
 Oh, pretty awesome guy.  Why don't you marry him, huh?  Alright, GAME ON!

Stewie:
 Rah Rah! STEW-S-A! STEW-S-A! STEW-S-A!

Brian:
 Wow, Stewie, thank you for saving my life! Y'know, a whole lot of other families would've just gotten a different dog and moved on.

Stewie:
 Oh, oh, w...we could, we could never do something like that, Brian!

Brian:
 Thanks for everything Stewie, you're my best friend, and I love you.

Stewie:
 All I can say, Brian is, you've been making really creepy eye contact with me all morning and I want it to stop right now.

Stewie:
 [comes from the future and sees Brian on the street. He sees the car heading right for him and runs to him] Brian, look out! [pushes him out of the way, letting the hockey stick and toy net to get broken by the car]

Brian:
 What the hell?!

Brian:
 What? Of course, I'm alive. What the hell's going on here?

Lois:
 Well Peter since you've been having such a tough time, I was thinking. Maybe I should look for a job.

Peter:
 Lois, I'll be damned if I let my wife be a prostitute.

Lois:
 What? No, I'll get a regular job.

Peter:
 [laughing] What, like a lawyer?

Lois:
 Peter, there are jobs for women between prostitute and lawyer.

Peter:
 War time nurse?

Manager:
 Now Mrs. Griffin, where did you go to college?

Lois:
 Groceries.

Manager:
 Are you available to work weekends?

Manager:
 Very impressive. This next one is a trick question. Groceries?

Lois:
 I'm hired.

Peter:
 How's this one?

Salesman:
 Oh, Bach is very good. I recommend.

Peter:
 And this one?

Salesman:
 Oh, Mozart, the boy genius. The best.

Peter:
 Ok, how about this?

Salesman:
 Oh, Debussy, I love Debussy! Sometimes all I can think about is Debussy. Oh, look at the pianist! The pianist is so good with Debussy.

Peter:
 So you like his early work?

Salesman:
 Oh, yes. When Debussy was young, that's when you want Debussy.

Peter:
 Ok, I'll take these two.

Salesman:
 Very good, sir. Just make sure you finish on the Bach. Never finish on Debussy.

Peter:
 Jack and the Beanstalk. And that title could be a fairy tale or a porn. Let's find out.

Quagmire:
 Where'd that thing come from? It's blocking my view of Little Miss Muffet's tuffet.

Stewie:
 So, what happened with you and those three little pigs? Why did you want to eat them so badly?

Brian:
 It's so amazing that that's what people think happened! First of all, I didn't want to eat them! I wanted to talk to one of them!

Stewie:
 About what?

Brian:
 Well, she was my ex-girlfriend and I believed I was due an explanation about why she was such a fucking whore.

Lois:
 I want that bitch Snow White to just admit she had an abortion.

Brian:
 [wagging his tail] Chew toys, take the chew toys.

Brian:
 Oh yeah that's...yeah just change me into whatever, yeah that's cool, thanks.

Joe:
 Oh my God, Peter, that might be the dumbest thing you've ever done!

Peter:
 No, the dumbest thing I ever did was open that can of Whup Ass!.

Peter:
 Lois, why did you buy this?

Lois:
 It was on sale!

Peter:
 [to viewer] Joe Pesci thought we were talkin' to him 'cause his name is Joe. Oh, you don't know who Joe Pesci is 'cause you're 14. You see, in the 90's, this was a tough guy.

Joe:
 This has gotta stop. The petty vying for my attention, the late night phone calls, the attack ads...

Narrator:
 Glenn Quagmire claims to be Joe Swanson's good friend, but would a good friend not return a leaf blower for four months during the leafy season?

Peter:
 I'm Peter Griffin, and I broke into a news station to make this.

Newscaster:
 Hey! Who's that guy?

Peter:
 [running off] Aagh!

Quagmire:
 There she is, my little Susie-wusie!

Peter:
 I love Susie more! C'mere, Susie! Uncle Peter's gonna give you a raspberry. [Joe and Quagmire watch in shock as Peter does raspberries on Susie]

Quagmire:
 Peter... that's not where you do a raspberry.

Peter:
 I closed my eyes too early.

Joe:
 I think it's best if you leave.

Peter:
 Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll hang out with my godson, Kevin! [opens Kevin's door]

Kevin:
 Get out!

Peter:
 He was masturbating with a knife.

Stewie:
 You're a terrible guy, Bri.

Peter:
 Well, looks like it's just you and me, Shadow. [Peter's shadow enters The Drunken Clam]

Bar Goers:
 Shadow!

Peter:
 I'm watching this awesome show, Brian. See, they took all these colors, and they're making them all live together in a beach-house. Now, the red one is sleeping with the green one, the blue one thinks he's gonna have a career in music, and the yellow one is just a total bitch!

Brian:
 Peter, that's just a channel that's gone off the air.

Announcer:
 And we'll be right back with more Color Bar Beach-House after these messages!

Angela:
 So as you can see, our output is up one-and-a-half percent. That's not net, I'm talking gross.

Osama:
 I ACCEPT JESUS AS MY LORD AND SAVIOR.

Osama:
 Yes!

Peter:
 Excuse me, how do I get back through the looking glass?

Sane Hatter:
 Oh yeah. Take two lefts, and it's the first door on your right.

Peter:
 Cool. Great. Thanks for not giving me the run-around. I asked that guy over there, but he just gave me a bunch of rhyming nonsense.

Sane Hatter:
 Oh yeah. He's like a well-known dick.

Peter:
 When I was eight, I was a dragon.

Peter:
 Alright! This is the greatest Sunday tradition ever...except for getting all my cutaway gags ready for the week.

Peter:
 Okay, my great uncle Wears a Ski Hat All the Time Griffin will be followed by Nick Nolte's handkerchief, followed by Japanese Abe Lincoln, and then Monkey Rabbi. Hey, where's the Monkey Rabbi? Here's your torah, you'll be here on Tuesday at 9. Check in with Shirley.

Peter:
 No no no. The really cartoony gays.

Peter:
 You know, I am gonna channel this anger into something useful. Like trying to get sand out of my backpack.

Peter:
 IT'S BEEN FOUR YEARS SINCE I WENT TO THE BEACH!!!

Joe:
 Try turning it inside out.

Peter:
 Don't you think I tried that?! That's the first thing I did!

Cleveland:
 What are you doing here?

Death:
 I'm, um...here for your show.

Cleveland:
 Come on, man. I'm on vacation.

Peter:
 This place gives me the creeps, like when I went to that pedophile opera.

Announcer:
 We are proud to present Mozart's The Magic Flute...in A minor. [applause]

Peter:
 AND YOU STILL WON'T GIVE US AN EMMY!?!?!??! Come on!! If Modern Family did that joke, you'd be carryin' 'em around on your shoulders!!

Peter:
 Comedy is tragedy plus time. [Hits Cleveland in the legs]

Cleveland:
 Ow!

Peter:
 And now...we wait.

God:
 Oh, by the way, Conway Twitty says, "Cut it out! Just write a joke!"

Chris:
 Hey dad, are you busy? I was thinking we could spend some time together.

Peter:
 Okay, are you a television set or the Internet?

Peter:
 It's almost Christmas, it's almost Christmas.

Peter:
 You overstepped! No Christmas!

Carter:
 [about his broken leg] The worst part about it is I can't have sex! God, I wish there was a way I could just do it myself, y'know, just to be done and napping within four minutes.

Carter:
 That... was... amazing! And Linda Carter wasn't actually here?

Peter:
 Oh no, my hairless twin got out! [cocks gun, a gunshot is heard]

s Twin:
 [holding gun] Hello, family. Let's eat all the garbage we want.

Peter:
 Listen Carter, you take me out of your will, I'm taking you out of mine! [grabs a sheet of paper and rips it]

Lois:
 Peter, that wasn't your will. That was your birth certificate.

Peter:
 Oh no! [begins fading and gasps] There's no light! There's only fire!

Brian:
 Look, Carter, I suppose you're entitled to do what you want, but, you know, I'm just saying if it were me, I would give all the money to charity.

Carter:
 Oh yeah, which charity?

Brian:
 Well, there are just so many that do such great work.

Carter:
 Name just one.

Brian:
 Um... well you know... Poor... Green... Whale... Guns... Books?

Carter:
 You are such a fraud.

Whale:
 Why won't anyone help us?!

Peter:
 For years, now, I've been planning on retiring at 45 so I can work on finding a cure for ballzheimer's disease.

Lois:
 Peter, are those testicles? Where did you get those?!

Peter:
 [sobbing] I don't remember!

Peter:
 Hey Chris, remember that kid you said was bullying you at school? Well here's his head.

Chris:
 [screams] That's not even him! That's the deaf kid!

Peter:
 Oh, that was sign language. I thought he was trying to defend himself with terrible karate.

Chris:
 Miley Cyrus had sex with a foam finger at like 6 P.M. Central Time.

Chris:
 [sleeping] Mumbling while asleep to indicate dream content.

Peter:
 Chris Griffin, will you marry me?

Chris:
 What? Is it even legal for a man to marry his son?

Peter:
 It is in Vermont. As long as it's a man and a man, anything goes up there. They're a bunch of liberal degenerates.

Chris:
 I don't know, it seems really weird. I mean, aren't men supposed to marry women?

Peter:
 No, no no, that's just all of human history except for the last five months.

Kevin:
 No, Dad!

Joe:
 I don't know what normal is anymore.

Chris:
 What if I said "Hey there shortie!"?

Peter:
 Smoke break!

Man:
 Nothing will ever be funnier than misunderstandings.

Chris:
 I mean... you have... a vulva and fallopian tubes.

Girl:
 Finally, a guy who listens!

Principal Shepherd:
 There's like no one hot at this school this year.

Stewie:
 Other people live here!

 Hartman:
 How many Vicodins for you to just leave me alone?

Lois:
 Forty.

Old Stewie:
 Back in my day, we had Katy Perry and Justin Bieber. That was real music.

Peter:
 We both go Latino, but soft Latino.

Principal Shepherd:
 I don't care what the courts say. Let's thank the Christian God together.

Stewie:
 You can't hold me prisoner in here forever!

Chris:
 Why not? Name one person who loves you.

Stewie:
 Wow, not a proportional response.

Stewie:
 You're not getting it, Chris, are you? You were being bullied day in and day out, so I tried to help you. I tried to be a good brother, and you've repaid me with abuse. You're the bully, Chris Griffin!

Stewie:
 [To Chris] I may no longer be on your back, but I'll always be on your side.

Principal Shepherd:
 Life's not as easy as you think it's gonna be right now.

Peter:
 Well, I finally quit smoking and I'm ready to go back to normal!

Lois:
 Peter, that's not how it works. The damage you've done is irreversible.

Brian:
 Yeah, Lois is right. As bad as you look, the damage you've done to your heart and your lungs is, no doubt, exponentially worse.

Peter:
 What?! Well try cuttin' to the outside of the house over some music. That usually works.

Peter:
 Fuck!

Janice:
 He, like, threw me down and he said "I hope your puppeteer has big hands because I'm not using lube."

Animal:
 Me no remember that, but...me believe it happened.

Tough guy:
 Smells like this guy already wet himself.

Peter:
 It says Glenn Quagmire. But if you squint and imagine it says 'Peter Griffin', it says Peter Griffin!

Stewie:
 Brian, I want you inside me.

Brian:
 You don't have to say like that.

Stewie:
 Hey, Dad, that's a cool hwhip. [gets whipped by Peter] AAAH!! I thought you couldn't understand me!!

Peter:
 Meg, you're gay!

Meg:
 No I'm not.

Peter:
 You like guys, right?

Meg:
 Yeah.

Peter:
 That's called being gay!

Peter:
 You know, Lois? Physicists believe there are two alternate universes, one in which I don't open the box, and one in which I do. [cut to the former universe] I'm not gonna open the box. [gets shot by Lois, cut to the latter universe] I'm gonna open the box. Ah, sweet! It's a whip! [whips the carpet]

Lois:
 Peter, be careful with that thing! Remember we're rentin' this house!

Stewie:
 That's depressing.

Peter:
 Wow! I haven't felt this powerful since I got to decide which ant lives and which ant dies. [cut to him speaking to two ants] You shall battle to the death, and the winner will be given his freedom! Why're you lookin' at me like that?

Lois:
 Peter, would you like a glass of... [sees that Peter has been killed by the ants] Oh my God! I told you not to play God with those ants!

Brian:
 You know, I'm so glad you finally agreed to go out with me, Jenna.

Jenna:
 Me, too. I'm having a really nice time. You seem like a great guy.

Stewie:
 Yes, thank you, we'll take the table in the corner, next to the herpes dog.

Chris:
 Oh, hey, Brian. And who's your date? Wow, you must be such a good person to knowingly go out with a herpes-riddled dirtbag.

Jenna:
 Ew! I'm sorry, Brian. I...I've got to go.

Brian:
 Damn it, you guys! Her dad's really rich!

Stewie:
 Wow, you weren't kidding.

Peter:
 I was in this booth when the Challenger exploded! [in flashback] Oh my God, no! [cut back to the present] I was in this booth on 9/11! [in flashback] Oh my God, no! [cut back to the present] I was in this booth when President Obama was elected! [in flashback] Oh my God, no!

Announcer:
 We now return to Jane Garofalo and Mark Ruffalo in GarofaRuffalo.

Lois:
 Turn it off, Chris. I don't even want to know what that is.

Chris:
 I don't understand what either of those words mean.

Peter:
 Shall we away for "relations."

Chris:
 Mom! Dad! The T.V.'s broken.

Peter:
 Actually, Chris, I got rid of our television. This is our new bookshelf, and I think you'll find it has more channels than any T.V. we ever owned.

Chris:
 I want to watch The Walking Dead!

Peter:
 Then I shall read to you from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.

Meg:
 I want to watch New Girl.

Peter:
 Perhaps you'd like to hear about Jane Eyre, who felt quite the new girl at Rochester's Thornbury Hall.

Chris:
 How about Game of Thrones?

Peter:
 Instead I shall read to you from...Game of Thrones.

Peter:
 Alright, if this is to be a smart family, we'll have to learn not to giggle at smart things that sound dirty but are not. Balzac.

 Meg and Stewie:
 [Giggling]

Peter:
 Homo Erectus.

Peter:
 Spotted dick

Peter:
 The results have been disappointing

Chris:
 I always thought spotted dick had something to do with Morgan Freeman.

Tom Tucker:
 Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker. Tonight the conclusion of our three part report on beastiality at the aquarium. But first our top story: A local boy dies after playing video games for 51 hours straight. He was playing Halo, now he has a halo. Just kidding, he was gay.

Peter:
 IT'S AWESOME!

Lois:
 Peter, wake up. I need to know if I can delete your iCarlys from the DVR.

Chris:
 [To a passing waiter] Kill that one.

Peter:
 Look, I think if you got to know us better, you wouldn't have any problem with your daughter dating one of us.

Quagmire:
 [off camera] I'll date her.

Peter:
 I'm great at finding stuff. Last night, I found Lois' g-spot.

Lois:
 [off camera] No, he didn't!

Peter:
 I didn't know she was home. I was able to please her in other ways, though.

Lois:
 [off screen] No!

Jerome:
 Peter, you seem like a nice guy. I don't mind having you in my bar man, but it's different when it's your baby girl.

Peter:
 I guess...I just have boys.

Peter:
 [to Jerome] It takes a man with a crazy-big hog to admit when he's wrong.

Peter:
 [after tipping Jerome's car over] I'm too fat to be in the car by myself.

Peter:
 Lesbians have regular carpets too, you pervs.

Quagmire:
 Pizza pizza!

Peter:
 Peter Peter!

Peter:
 [as a decapitated head from Lord of the Flies] I took one step outside the resort.

Peter:
 [to Chris] I figured the day you came home with a girl, we'd have to back her through the garage.

Peter:
 A little further, a little further, a little further, whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Okay, now do you prefer Fatty or Mrs. Boombalady?

Peter:
 [to Jerome] That's right, you banged my wife.

Stewie:
 He did? No wonder I had so room in there. Her womb was like one of those places where they reconstruct crashed airplanes.

Quagmire:
 You guys are gonna lose. It's been 62 hours. Joe, you're about to drop, and Peter, you've been hallucinating all night.

Peter:
 Yeah, whatever Quagmire, I've gotta go to the bathroom. Where's your toilet?

Quagmire:
 Right here, Peter.

Peter:
 Better cover the seat. Ah, JK, I'm not fancy.

Skunk:
 [To Brian] Oh, you don't like smell huh? Well, sniff on this!

Brian:
 Holy crap! I'm so much faster on all fours!

Peter:
 That is a tough, tough place to get into. That is tough. But once you're in there, you'll be surprised how much you like it.

Peter:
 I don't hate ya Meg. You're my kid.

Crowd:
 Move that bus! [bus moves to reveal Bethenny Frankel] Put that bus back!

Peter:
 Oh that's not good. They were 70% of the structure of this house.

Peter:
 See Meg, you can be in the flashback 'cause we're friends now.

Peter:
 Hey Meg, you wanna huck some water balloons at nerds?

Meg:
 Sure! [Peter throws a water balloon at Lois]

Lois:
 What the hell? [Peter and Meg laugh]

Peter:
 We'll work on the laugh, but you'll get there. To the Megcopter! [Peter and Meg board said vehicle and fly off] Huh, look down there. It looks like me with a green shirt. He's murderin' a lady!

Retep:
 Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah!

Lois:
 Where are you goin' now?

Peter:
 We're goin' two places: None o' Yo and Beeswax.

Peter:
 [after the last one attaches to his groin] I got a piercing, too.

Brian:
 What's that big rock doin' there?

Retep:
 Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah!

Cleveland:
 Wassup?! ["The Cleveland Show" theme music plays as Cleveland approaches the guys]

Peter:
 Oh, hey, Cleveland!

Cleveland:
 Alright, I knew this was comin', everbody gimme your best shot.

Quagmire:
 Oh, my G...Where do I even begin? Y'know, it's not a good sign that this is the first time a lot of people are realizing you had a show!

Quagmire:
 The talking bear was so bad, Seth MacFarlane quit voicing him after Season 2.

Quagmire:
 [laughs] It worked out okay in movie form.

Peter:
 Yeah, here's four seasons worth of DVDs of what we've been up to. Y'know, just so you're back up to speed. And I'll warn ya ahead of time, these have jokes in 'em.

Rallo:
 What 'sup, man?

Stewie:
 Yeah, yeah, 'sup. Keep walking, ya Boondocks ripoff.

Joe:
 What's going on? You guys touch pee-pees or something?

Peter:
 You know, not a single person stopped watching because you left.

Quagmire:
 He doesn't have the guts to say anything back.

Lois:
 [outside the bathroom] Peter, what are you doing in there?

Peter:
 [as "Slow Ride" by Foghat begins playing] Nothing. [repeatedly flushes the toilet as the song plays]

Lois:
 Peter, you're wasting tons of water!

Peter:
 It's not a waste, and we need a faster toilet!

Narrator:
 We now return to The Gay Bachelor.

Gay Bachelor:
 Oh, they're all gross! I'm keeping the roses.

Donna:
 Your timeouts are a joke! You're a terrible parent!

Lois:
 I'm a terrible parent?! You're a child abuser. You know what? From now on, I don't want our families having anything to do with each other.

Peter:
 Well, Cleveland, looks like these 2 little alley cats have scrapped it out. I'll see ya tomorrow.

Lois:
 That includes you, Peter! I don't want you ever talking to Cleveland again!

Donna:
 And, Cleveland, I forbid you from ever talking to Peter again!

Donna:
 Cleveland, get in here, and pull your pants down! [slaps Cleveland repeatedly]

Cleveland:
 Aah! Aah! Ugh! Aah! At least turn me over to my backside!

Chris:
 Mom's making me sleep in the basement.

Peter:
 Sleeping lower in the house is a big punishment for her.

Joe:
 Quagmire, please stop touching my baby with a condom.

Quagmire:
 For my next trick, I'm gonna split my beautiful assistant in half, and not the way you think. [holding a condom] Won't be needing this.

Chris:
 Mrs. Brown, I want you to spank me again.

Brian:
 I am colorblind [Points to eyes] here, [Points to heart] and here.

Lois:
 Stewie, you get down from there this instant!

Stewie:
 Munch me, bitch!

Lois:
 Right now, Stewie, or you're in timeout!

Stewie:
 How many gray pubes you plucked today, you old bag?

Donna:
 Oh, Cleveland, I'm gonna hate those Griffins forever!

Peter:
 Only my side had airbags.

Lois:
 I don't wanna be here with that Brown family.

Stewie:
 That sounds even more racist than it is.

Peter:
 Cleveland and I have won every three-legged race in Quahog except that time those two one-legged guys formed the perfect running person.

Quagmire:
 [Stuck with Joe in the three-legged race] I waited too long to pick a partner.

Cleveland:
 How much do you weigh?

Peter:
 I don't know; my car can't go up hills, though.

Stewie:
 She's camel-toeing the hell out of that leotard.

Stewie:
 I'm gonna live-tweet the show and ruin it for everyone in other time zones.

Lois:
 Oh no, Stewie's havin' a tantrum. Come here, sweetie. [gets bitten] Ow! Screw you, you little turd!

Stewie:
 [at a lemonade stand] Chris, pour the man his lemonade.

Chris:
 [trapped in a pitcher] I can't! The lemonade tricked me and got away.

Lemonade:
 [running off] Lemons are God's children!

Lois:
 Happy birthday, Stewie! And here's your equal attention cake, Peter!

Peter:
 Yay! [blows out both cakes' candles]

Peter:
 Yay, double wishes! [a meteorite lands on Meg] One. [the meteorite splits to reveal a Snickers bar] Two.

Stewie:
 All right Rupert, time to break up Lois and The Fat Man before they can conceive me by pressing butts together. Well you don't know either!

Stewie:
 That's right. Stewie Long Legs just blew your mind.

Chris:
 It took three years, but I am finally through all that porn.

Meg:
 Great. The string broke again. [opens the bathroom door and sees Stewie] Hey, there, tiny hands!

Stewie:
 Go away! This is why Zillow estimates our house at four dollars!

Peter:
 Chris, look! Mom's naked!

Peter:
 [smacking Chris with his mattress] You creep. [Chris crashes into and breaks the TV]

Peter:
 [smacking Lois with his mattress] Unga bunga!

Stewie:
 I don't want to watch it upstairs on the small TV, I want to watch it downstairs on the big TV. [his face turns red as he starts crying] I want to watch my show!

Lois:
 I don't appreciate how you spray-painted "vile woman" on the bedroom wall!

Peter:
 That wasn't me! Must've been one of the kids!

Peter:
 You know something? I'm starting to think whoever wrote that is right!

Nigel:
 Sir, it's 6 P.M., and you're still in your 5:45 tuxedo.

Stewie:
 Nigel, yesterday I saw you smile. Is that something I need to bring up with my father?

Nigel:
 I was just imagining my own death, sir.

Lois:
 [puts Stewie in bed] You've earned yourself a time-out, young man. Now you stay in here until you can behave. [closes the door]

Chris:
 Yay! A crossover always brings out the best in each show! It certainly doesn't smack of desperation. The priorities are always creative and not driven by marketing...

Stewie:
 Okay, that's enough.

Brian:
 I guess we're in a town called Springfield.

Brian:
 I can t imagine we re allowed to say.

Lois:
 Oh, this Springfield place looks nice.  We should visit here again.

Peter:
 Don t drink the water. Everyone around here looks like they have hepatitis.

Peter:
 [to Apu] Hello, Funny-Sounding Cleveland!

Peter:
 Mmm...donut...

Homer:
 I think you and I are gonna get along juuuuuuust okay.

Stewie:
 "Eat my shorts." I love that! Is that a popular expression like "What the deuce"?

Bart:
 Uh, yeah, I'm lookin' for a friend, last name Kebum, first name Leigh.

Moe:
 Eh, hang on, I'll check. Uh, hey, guys, do I got a Leigh Kebum? C'mon, look at the stools. Uh, is there a Leigh Kebum? Somebody check the rear, I know I gotta Leigh Kebum.

Stewie:
 Hello, Moe? Your sister's bein' raped!

Homer:
 What's he doin' here?

Peter:
 Oh, we gotta carry him 'cause he can't fly on his own. We let that other guy try and look what happened.

Cleveland:
 No, no, no, no, no, NO!!!

Homer:
 Alright, Peter, If we're gonna find your car, we gotta think like a car. So let's fill up at that gas station.

Peter:
 I feel sick.

Homer:
 Keep drinking! I prepaid 40 bucks!

Peter:
 Homer, maybe we're doing this wrong.

Peter:
 Oh crap.

Homer:
 No. It's not good. This beer tastes exactly like Duff. It's just a lousy ripoff.

Homer:
 No, this is just the same as Duff, but, like, worse.

Peter:
 Hey, come on, now, this is my favorite beer you're talkin' about. Hell, I work for the company. It's my livelihood.

Moe:
 [takes the beer] Oh, yeah? Well, your livelihood is based on fraud.

Peter:
 I'm whisperin' in court to look smart.

Quagmire:
 Do you like sex?

Lenny:
 Eh.

Quagmire:
 I don't think we're that similar.

Cleveland:
 You know why they got us sittin' next to each other.

Carl:
 Uh, because we're the two funniest guys in our town?

Cleveland:
 Damn right!

Quahog James Woods:
 You lived in Springfield?

Springfield James Woods:
 Yeah, I worked at the Kwik-E-Mart, researching a role.

Quahog James Woods:
 These guys are gonna lose.

Judge Fred Flintstone:
 I've heard all I need to hear to make a decision. If ya ask me, neither of these beers is wholly original. They're both pale imitations of my favorite beer, Budrock.

Peter:
 Oh ho ho!

Judge Fred Flintstone:
 But rendering a verdict is something I'm paid to YABBA-DABBA-DOO!

 Homer:
 Eh.

Judge Fred Flintstone:
 And I find in favor of Duff.

Lois:
 Oh no!

Meg:
 Oh no!

Peter:
 Oh no!

Peter:
 Hello.

Aid Man:
 Uh, hey. I'm...I'm in the wrong Springfield.

Peter:
 What the hell? That really hurts!

Homer:
 No, it doesn't! I do it to my son all the time!

Peter:
 You strangle your son? That's insane! No wonder he s fat and stupid and masturbates all the time!

Homer:
 That s your son!

Ralph:
 Heh-heh, I'm in danger.

Roger:
 Yeah, it's really great, isn't it, guys? [to the camera] We went to summer camp together.

Peter:
 Woohoo!

Homer:
 Road House!

Homer:
 Say hi to Maude Flanders.

Peter:
 No, you say hi to Muriel Goldman.

Peter:
 I'm sorry we fought. I just wanted to make you laugh and cry. I'm a Family Guy.

Homer:
 I understand. I'm a The Simpsons.

Homer:
 Let's just agree to stay a half hour away from each other.

Peter:
 With a pile of garbage between us.

Comic Book Guy:
 Worst. Chicken fight. Ever.

Brian:
 Could you close the gate? A couple o' calves got loose. Pow!

Al Harrington:
 Short but handsome slightly hairy newly single salesman!

s Heart:
 Brian, this is your heart. What the hell do you think you're doing, man? Stop.

s Penis:
 Brian, this is your penis. Don't listen to him. We're this close to bone city.

Peter:
 Brian, I'm here too. I'm hanging out with your penis and your heart.

s ghostwriter:
 Scary stuff, scary stuff, scary stuff, ding! Scary stuff, scary stuff, scary stuff, ding! Scary stuff, scary stuff, scary stuff, lunch!

Peter:
 Come on, Joe. You can't be afraid. What if Bono had been afraid to wear sunglasses? Then nobody would know about Africa.

Lois:
 Was someone wearing my new high heels?

Stewie:
 You dick.

Stewie:
 Brian, why does everything you touch turn to garbage?

Boy:
 We should probably exchange numbers.

Stewie:
 Ok, I'm a ten, you're a four.

Lois:
 Get outta here! This blood's not for you!

Mosquito:
 Aww. Oh look, an empty tire with some water in it. All right, I'm happy again.

Narrator:
 TV, that thing you used to watch.

Peter:
 Aagh! Aagh! Sex! Sex!

Lois:
 Peter, your arms are turning purple.

Peter:
 Purple with success. That's the color of money.

Lois:
 That was the right thing to do, Peter.

Joe:
 That was an unearned giggity, Quagmire.

Quagmire:
 I said "up". No?

Brian:
 Stewie, what are you doing?

Stewie:
 Being awesome.

Stewie:
 Ah crap. I should've known something was up when I saw all those cars out front.

Brian:
 I have to go to Chris' room. We're doing a masturbation intervention. I got a buncha his friends sitting in a circle in there... oh dear God!

Cookie Monster:
 Me love Cookie! Om nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom!

 Hartman:
 Yes, I'd like a chocolate chip cookie.

 Hartman:
 Elmer!

 Hartman:
 What, Mom? You promised I could get a cookie if I finished all my surgery.

 Hartman:
 Did you?

 Hartman:
 ...yeah...

 Hartman:
 All of it?

 Hartman:
 ...uh...

 Hartman:
 Get back there!

 Hartman:
 I'm gonna do it! What does it matter when I do it?

Man:
 Today's feature presentation of Glory will not be seen.

Peter:
 What? Aw, I love that movie. Aw man, that's gonna leave a big hole in their line-up. What's gonna fill the Glory-hole?

Man:
 In place of Glory, we will be showing Shaft starring Richard Roundtree.

Peter:
 What? You can't just shove Shaft in the Glory-hole.

Bonnie:
 Uh, huh. Can you open the sliding door?

Bonnie:
 I'll take it.

Stewie:
 Well, if anybody knows how to "pull out," it's Quagmire.

Peter:
 Just gimme the rope! Nobody has to get hurt, Brian. [crashes into a bicyclist] Only one person has to get hurt.

Brian:
 [injured because of Peter's greed] Dammit Peter, what were you thinking? This has to be the stupidest thing you've ever done!

Peter:
 No Brian, the stupidest thing I ever did was turn the bubbles off in a hot tub. [cut to said incident] Yeah, party! [shuts off the bubbles] Eww, baths with friends.

Chris:
 This is the craziest meal I've had since I had lunch at Tommy Sullivan's house. [cut to said incident] Very good macaroni and cheese, Mrs. Sullivan.

 Sullivan:
 Thank you, Chris.

Peter:
 That was just awful, Chris.

Lois:
 Terrible!

Peter:
 He is not ready for flashbacks.

Lois:
 No, he is not.

Peter:
 [about Dumb Beaver] We use him just the right amount.

Lois:
 [with gargantuan breasts] I don't know what happened. I told the doctor C cups.

Peter:
 I told him something else.

Dumb Beaver:
 I think he did a "dam" good job.

Peter:
 Okay, now we've used him too much.

Peter:
 [about Prescott Towers] The ceiling is a pool! The ceiling is a pool! Quagmire, you gotta get this!

Peter:
 [shoving scissors up his nose at a meeting] Hey guys? I gotta leave. I got a nosebleed and, uh, I don't work here.

Peter:
 Never judge a book by its cover. Or a movie. [cut to him punching a movie titled "Funny People"] No!

Joe:
 It's probably nothing but there is a stain on the rug with the shape of a little kid.

Cleveland:
 I don't know if you want this now but I bought you a mini-cactus.

Quagmire:
 What the hell?! THIS IS A DUMP!!!

Peter:
 Well, maybe it still got a nice ocean view? [opens the window only to see a sick old man next door]

Old man:
 [dry voice] The harbour is poisoned...

Quagmire:
 DAMMIT, BRIAN SCREWED ME!

Brian:
 No, I'm serious. Even though I know you never liked me, you still helped me when I really needed it. That says a lot about your character. I'm ashamed of myself because I am none of the things you are. You're honest and direct and compassionate and... [his phone chimes] that is 72 hours! Enjoy your craphole, dumbass!

Lois:
 I guess that's it for you and real estate, huh Brian?

Brian:
 Yeah, it was a lot tougher than I thought.

Lois:
 [sarcastic] Oh yeah, it's real hard bein' a real estate agent. I mean, you gotta be able to count bathrooms.

Peter:
 I once beat a real estate agent in a game of chess. Me! A well-known buffoon!

Brian:
 Come on, guys, gimme a break. I had a rough day.

Meg:
 You've had a rough day? You guys wouldn't believe the day I've had. First of all, I didn't have any clean underwear this morning, so I had to wear a bathing suit. Then I missed the bus, of course, then it looked like it was gonna start to rain. Luckily it didn't, and like that wasn't enough, then we had a pop quiz in history. [Peter forces scissors up his nose] Oh, European history, American history was last year. Then...

Lois:
 Peter, we have people coming over and they're expecting a turkey!

Peter:
 If they're expecting a turkey, I'll just put on Evan Almighty! Zap!

Lois:
 Chris, are Brian and your father back yet?

Chris:
 No, and why are you saying the dog's name before Dad's?

Stewie:
 It's weird. Y...yeah, you're right, that is weird.

Peter:
 Oh, that is the nicest thing anyone's done for me since my kids gave me that Father's Day gift.

Peter:
 Oh, look, a tie. Perfect.

Chris:
 It's from all of us!

Lois:
 Oh, my God, it looks like he's chalking up a pool cue!

Peter:
 We'll be back with a turkey faster than you can say, "Jack Robinson."

Lois:
 Jack Ro... [Slurs] Jack Ro... [Slurs]

Peter:
 She had a stroke that killed the part of her brain that says, "Jack Robinson." We got plenty of time.

Peter:
 Is this...is this fine?

Brian:
 I mean it's not...it's...yeah, it's fine if you think it's fine.

Peter:
 It's not that good of a song, but we know it.

Brian:
 Yeah, ok. Sure.

Peter:
 Brian, I love Train!

Brian:
 I fucking love Train!

Brian:
 Nice Thanksgiving... I don't know why I ever listen to that jerk.

Peter:
 What? Home is this way. We're both just walking home.

Brian:
 Leave me alone!

Peter:
 No way. We're a team, Brian, whether you like it or not. Just like almond butter and no sugar added fruit preserves.

Mother:
 Who's hungry?

Kids:
 We are!

Announcer:
 Hey, kids! Would you like a terrible healthy sandwich?

Kids:
 No!

Announcer:
 Too bad! Because your recently divorced mom has a crush on her trainer! And he eats like this, so now you have to, too! Almond butter and no sugar added fruit preserves! Just like PB&J, but with more of your mom railing this guy!

Trainer:
 I named myself "Kaya".

Peter:
 I wish you didn't have to die, but a bunch of white people put on sweaters.

Joe:
 Hey, do you think if I let Jesus sleep with Bonnie he'd give me back the use of my legs?

Lois:
 Peter, this chair costs $3000!

Peter:
 That's not so much, Lois. It's only infinity times what you bring home every week.

Joe:
 Sex is overrated.

Peter:
 Stay outta this, Joe.

Quagmire:
 Oh God I love sex!

Carrie Underwood:
 Jesus, take the wheel.

Carrie Underwood:
 I wanna kill these fucking cops!

Jesus:
 I want my first time to be with...Lois.

Peter:
 Lois, my partner in the law firm?

Jesus:
 No, Peter. It's your Lois. Lois Griffin.

Peter:
 What? I am outraged! But probably not as outraged as the ten million Christians watching. Please write to this address. Quickly. Maybe we can both stop these Hollywood Jew writers from wreckin' my marriage and your religion.

Peter:
 Ah crap, I just pulled 1000 muscles!

Jesus:
 Yeah, I guess. Who cares? I'm not even real, merry Christmas.

Stewie:
 Alright Chris, it's 1798 and we're in the home of Jane Austen.

Chris:
 Jane Austen? I don't think she's on my history test Stewie.

Stewie:
 Oh, I know. We're just here to release pent up time travel farts.

Chris:
 Awesome!

Brian:
 Yeah!

Stewie:
 Wait a minute. Pre-Soviet Russia? This wasn't on the manifest.

Brian:
 Yeah, this is kind of a personal thing. [approaches Ivan Pavlov] Hey, Pavlov, you dog teasing dick! How's this for positive reinforcement?! [Brian bludgeons Pavlov to death with one of his bells and then spits on his corpse] All right, where to next?

Chris:
 I want to kill more scientists!

Teacher:
 Peter Griffin?

Peter:
 There.

Peter:
 I'm gonna help you study by nailing your door shut. That way, you'll have no choice but to hit the books. Ah crap, I left my phone in there. Damn it, it's nailed shut.

Chris:
 Dad, it looks like some girl sent you a picture of her privates.

Peter:
 Ah crap! [Axing down the door] Lois, I don't have the phone! Stop sending pictures!

Lois:
 I already sent four more!

Peter:
 Chris, put down the phone! Don't look at those!

Chris:
 Wait a minute. That's both her hands! Who the hell is taking the pictures?

Peter:
 All right, gimme that phone and get back to work, and before you judge your mother, you did most of that damage.

Stewie:
 We'll just tell Chris he's dreaming because I don't want him to know about my time machine.

Brian:
 Why not?

Stewie:
 It's like having a pickup truck; once people know you got one, there go your weekends.

Stewie:
 The year is 1803.

Chris:
 Ah, the future.

Tony Sirico:
 Hey Family Guy, you're lucky I got a manicotti in the oven, or I'd bash your face into a bolognese. That's two kinds of food; that's how angry I am.

Tony Sirico:
 That's two!

Brian:
 Chris, there you are.

Chris:
 Well, well, well. If it isn't Booger Breath and the Mushroom Tip.

Stewie:
 Which one of us is which?

Brian:
 Looks like one ship was saved today: a relationship.

Brian:
 I mean I was having fun, making new friends, getting laid all the time, sleeping like a rock, but you made the call. You unilaterally decided I was better off a bitter alcoholic failure who could only hang out with a baby.

Ruth:
 Your mom's so fucking hot!

Brian:
 Oh, cool. My friend Pete is here. Pete Za. [chuckles] Nom, nom, nom, nom. That's going to be me in, like, five minutes!

Peter:
 It's fun being stupid. You don't gotta worry about nothing, you don't gotta read books and you never die.

Brian:
 Peter, that's not correct.

Peter:
 How would you know, stupid? [Chris and Stewie laugh]

Brian:
 Thanks a lot, SAT.

Brian:
 Bazinga!

Peter:
 Like what the gay scientist says.

Peter:
 Gross! He's getting his nose period.

 Hartman:
 I did a CAT scan.

Peter:
 On a dog. [laughs]

 Hartman:
 We laughed about that, too.

Brian:
 I'm awesome-sauce.

Stewie:
 Either take the tumor out of him or put one in me! I can't stand this!

Brian:
 Hey, this isn't the Kenny Chesney concert!

Dog:
 [after being sent to outer space by the Soviet Union] Joke on them! I find happy dog planet. In 50 years, we all go back to Earth and bite everybody, but now, we dance!

Brian:
 What? , Uh, how about top and bottom or front and back?

Stewie:
 How about I take head, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes?

Brian:
 Ok, you can have those.

Stewie:
 You've never gotten an award.

Brian:
 Uh, what's that bowl that says "good boy"?

Stewie:
 You know; that was our old dog's dish.

Peter:
 Tell us fast about your nonsense so I can plow your mother on the staircase.

Evan:
 You got 35,000 views in one night, and none of them got past the fourth picture.

Meg:
 What does that mean? Oh.

Peter:
 What the hell? There's an animated version of you and me doing it. Who put that in there?

Brian:
 People keep passing out and barfing, and that barf is, like, free to take.

 Hartman:
 Mr. Griffin, would you like to cut the cord?

Peter:
 Sure. [Does so]

 Hartman:
 Ok, that wasn't the cord, and now you've got a girl.

Brian:
 Stewie, would you like your food served to you as an airplane or a magic bus?

Brian:
 Stewie still screams, "What's happening?" when he gets an erection.

Stewie:
 AAAHH! What's happening?

Quagmire:
 Sorry. Joe's Wi-Fi is really slow today.

Peter:
 I know; it's the worst. We also use his cable TV. I like Joe.

Quagmire:
 Here we go. Oh, it's a busy night. There's a black-Thai event. That's all black and Thai chicks.

Joe:
 Peter, we've got a problem. Somehow, my foot got pregnant watching Tower Heist.

Judge:
 I have no choice but to sentence you to twenty years in prison!

Peter:
 Don't think of it as twenty years, think of it as two ten-year-olds ya sick freak.

Quagmire:
 Why are you, of all people, defending a religious nut? Aren't you an Atheist?

Brian:
 [chuckling] Yeah, it's crazy. You can think about that while you're in jail.

Judge:
 Now, Mr. Griffin, I understand you're here to speak on Mr. Quagmire's behalf.

Peter:
 That's right, Your Honor. And as we know, according to Game of Thrones, if the girl has had her blood, she is good to go. Has the girl had her blood? Answer the question!

Judge:
 Mr. Griffin, she was underage.

Peter:
 Yes, however, Mr. Quagmire was born on February 29th. Ergo, he's only 12. Ergo, the girl raped him. Argo, Ben Affleck.

Chris:
 Where is your daughter? Show her to us!

Meg:
 Mom, I need a check for the school field trip.

Peter:
 Jeez, Meg, didn't I just take you on a field trip?

Peter:
 Ok, here's the field! Goodbye forever! [Drives off and crashes] Aaahh! Meg, I'm injured! Please help me! I smell gas! [The car explodes] Meg, I'm still alive but I'm badly burned! Come save my life and nurse me back to health! Oh, God, why do bad things happen to good people?

Quagmire:
 You said you were 23!

Keira:
 Yeah, and you said you love me.

Quagmire:
 Well, I guess you got me there.

Peter:
 I'm carrying three handguns, and the metal detectors picked up nothing.

Crystal:
 I know this jail sentence seems long, but salvation can last all eternity.

Peter:
 You know what else lasts an eternity? This conversation.

Stewie:
 Did you hear about your ex-husband yet? He had a, uh, procedure.

Lois:
 [After hugging Quagmire] You better get rid of that before you get in there.

Peter:
 Quagmire got away with it and learned nothing. That's great.

Chris:
 It's made of Skittles! You want to eat the baby together on the way home?

Chris:
 This day has H agen-Dazs written all over it!

Peter:
 Now, what are the ingredients to a viral internet video?

Stewie:
 Good morning Brian.

Brian:
 [sniffs] What is that? I smell pee.

Stewie:
: Yes, you do, Brian.

Brian:
 Oh, my God, that thing's positive! Is Lois pregnant again?

Stewie:
 No...

Brian:
: Meg is pregnant?

Stewie:
 You're getting warmer. [clears throat]

Brian:
 Wha... What have you done?

Stewie:
 I think you mean, what have we done?

Stewie:
 Brian... we're pregnant!

Stewie:
 And in 18 years, he's going to move away!

Stewie:
 Could you do that thing where you take some fluid and tell me if it's going to be an imbecile or a cretin?

 Hartman:
 Oh, not to worry. There are places where those people can be warehoused, but from strictly eyeballing you I'd say everything looks fine.

Stewie:
 Oh, that's wonderful! Now Brian, did you have any questions for the doctor?

Brian:
 Yeah, are there a lot of stairs in this building?

Stewie:
 I have a such craving for burgers. It's like my body is just craving red meat, and mint chip ice cream and only mint chip. Any other ice creams makes me want to puke. Is that weird?

Adam West:
 [Observing Stewie giving birth in Brian's car] Mazel tov!

Cleveland:
 Hey, I went by your house the other day. Is your baby pregnant?

Peter:
 I don't know. Lois is in charge of the kids.

Peter:
 You know how everybody remembers that video of a monkey performing a sex act on a frog at the zoo?

Joe:
 That frog?

Peter:
' '[filming on his phone] Bingo.

Joe:
 [with a concerned expression] I'm concerned that frog's in more danger than she realizes.

Adam West:
 Cleveland, let me tell you something [grabs Cleveland by the front of his shirt]... you're absolutely fucking right.

Peter:
 Get all of her squawking out doc?

Adam West:
 Dr. Brown, I just killed nine people! Uh, I mean, I have ducks on my feet. Old crazy harmless mayor. Quack quack!

Marla:
 There you are. Listen up, Meg. This TSA isn't sweaty enough for the two of us.

Marla:
 It means stay away from Larry. I'm his girlfriend.

Peter:
 Lois! Lois, it's back!

Lois:
 I heard, Peter! I heard!

Peter:
 Kids, kids, it's happening! Get your coats! This is what we practiced for!

Meg:
 I love you, Dad!

Peter:
 I love you, too, sweetheart! None of the past matters!

Joe:
 Twenty years on the force and no one's ever clapped for me, except for that one sarcastic gay guy.

Homosexual:
 [Sarcastic clapping] Great observation.

Joe:
 I know you mean the opposite of what you're saying.

Humpty Dumpty:
 My God, it's a miracle! You were able to put me back together again.

Doctor:
 Yeah, it was actually a pretty simple procedure. Maybe next time, go straight to a medical professional and skip the horses and illiterate servants.

Humpty Dumpty:
 Well, that is the last time I drink and masturbate on top of a high wall.

Peter:
 Hey, buddy, how you doing? You ok? Everything ok? I'm talking like this because I'm being very careful not to upset you, and for some reason, this is the voice people use to do that.

Lois:
 [Wearing Peter's pants] Oh, thank you, Jazzercise.

Joe:
 [After two failed suicide attempts] I stink at this.

Quagmire:
 [Grabbing onto Joe's leg] You know, this is actually the first time I've ever touched Joe.

Peter:
 I love Niagara Falls.

Cleveland:
 I was the only black man ever to go there. The tourists were taking pictures of me. One of them thought I was a bear.

Indiana Jones:
 Snakes...why did it have to be snakes?

Snake:
 Elderly potheads...why did it have to be elderly potheads?

Peter:
 Oh Lois, your dog threw up.

Neil Goldman:
 Hey Chris, I noticed you were sitting alone. Mind if I join you.

Chris:
 Sure, we both have hats, makes sense.

Peter:
 Alright Brian, it's time for you to take one of these pills from the vet.

Brian:
 Uh yeah, right. Can we do what we normally where we roll it up in a piece of cheese like you're fooling me?

Peter:
 Yeah, I guess. But then you're going to have cheese in your ass.

Meg:
 Look, I'd love to stay and talk Neil, but I have homework and there was no toilet paper in the girls bathroom.

Peter:
 [inhaling loudly] ...GOES THE WEASEL!

Principal Shepherd:
 [looking buff as he directs kids through the school hallway] Move along, gotta keep the hallway clear. This isn't because of my divorce.

Chris:
 Good for him, he actually followed through.

Meg:
 Thanks for doing my book report Neil. AND I didn't even have to change the handwriting because you write like a girl.

Neil:
 You should see me throw.

Chris:
 You know, If I didn't know better I'd think that FISH ARE GHOSTS and I'd also think that you're putting the moves on Meg.

Stewie:
 Master? AND a surprisingly quick erection for Stewie.

Peter:
 Thanks, Brian. I love the new you. That obedience school really schooled you in obedience.

Meg:
 You know, this is nice. It's actually the first time I've been on a date since I got the nickname "gutter ball."

 Hartman:
 [irritated] Ok dad, you got us in, now just go.

Quagmire:
 Cleveland, what are you looking at?

Cleveland:
 I'm on edge. Saw Halloween II last night.

Peter:
 Brian, go outside. Keep guard for Michael Myers.

Cleveland:
 If he seem like he dead, he ain't dead.

Neil:
 [sadly] I'm sorry Meg, but my friendship with Chris, is more important.

Meg:
 You're a jerk, Neil!

Peter:
 This is b...'cause I'm drunk.

Cleveland:
 [from inside] Move out, Irish trash.

Lois:
 I think that we just have to accept that this is how he is now. Don't forget he bit you, Peter. I mean, what if he bit Stewie?

Stewie:
 [calling from his bedroom] Why don't you bite me, bitch.

Stewie:
 [from his bedroom] I'm sorry, was that too harsh? It sounded more playful in my head.

Peter:
 And now I'm gonna go upstairs and pee in Meg's bed.

Brian:
 NO...We're going to go pee in Meg's bed.

Peter:
 Good boy.

Quagmire:
 Thanks you, thank you, thank you very mush. Joe, I'd tell you to take your seat, but I'd be about fifteen years too late.

Lois:
 [offscreen] And so do I!

Becca:
 [about Lois] That voice! Ugh.

Jamie:
 Your wife is such a pig.

Peter:
 Oh I don't know about that, Jamie. Pigs eat slop; Lois only cooks it.

Peter:
 Our cycles have lined up; mine's from wiping too hard.

Jamie:
 I guess Peter made it to the bathroom 'cause I can't feel him walking anymore!

Becca:
 I know! Fe fi fo fum! Right?

Peter:
 Lois, you were right; those women were talking about me.

Lois:
 Oh, dear. What did they say?

Peter:
 I don't even remember. There was such a long cutaway, but I know it was really mean.

Jerome:
 Peter, you're loud, you can't hold down a job and your blood pressure's high. If ya didn't have such a damn tiny ding a ling, you could be a black guy!

Cleveland:
 Peter's got a small penis, but hey! Nuthin' grows in the shade!

Liam Neeson:
 Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to get a free movie set haircut.

Guard:
 Wake up, Griffin. Your bail's been posted.

Peter:
 What time is it?

Liam Neeson:
 I did. Oh, sorry. I thought you were gonna ask something else.

Liam Neeson:
 All right, it's a deal. You can help me with some chores. But one slip-up, and you'll be deader than the first man to die in the Battle of the Boyne.

Peter:
 Normally when we do those, there's... there's, like, a joke.

Liam Neeson:
 I'm not your clown.

Stewie:
 Hey, did you hear about that old woman who lives in a shoe? Has so many children she doesn't know what to do? Well, I know what she should do. Get your tubes tied,you kook!

Counselor:
 [While trying to help the couple find out more about each other] Peter, when is Lois' birthday?

Peter:
 Uhhh, when is Hitler's birthday?

Peter:
 Wow. Ok, Noel. Yikes.

Counselor:
 Cleveland?

Quagmire:
 Shaved. S..sorry, what is it? What was the question?

Stewie:
 Tom Cruise. I spent one afternoon with the guy and it's like I signed an eight year contract to show up at events with him and let him fake-father a child.

Brian:
 Stewie, I would think Tom Cruise has better things to do than follow you around.

Quagmire:
 Yeah, we get us tickets on Kayak. It is a nightmare itinerary: It was like 80 bucks, but it has four stops.

Cleveland:
 Two of them are in Houston.

Peter:
 We act like we don't take a lot from The Simpsons, but we take a LOT from The Simpsons.

Lois:
 I don't know. L...Let's just keep it new for a few weeks.

Peter:
 A few weeks?! Come on, you know I'm terrible at waiting for things.

Man on TV:
 We'll be right back with more Laverne & Shirley.

Peter:
 BUT I WANT IT NOW!

Stewie:
 You are just horrible. You're even worse than those people who take dumps in the shower. [Cut to Meg taking a shower]

Joe:
 [gasps] I wonder if everything's okay at the old embassy.

Peter:
 Sorry, somebody e-mailed me a video of a sheep screaming.

Lois:
 Last night, you left your dirty dishes in the sink. It's disgusting.

Lois:
 So I did half and I left the other half for you.

Peter:
 What if God is a serial killer? He lowers the average lifespan of humans to sixty five and there are many exceptions based on genetics and diet.

Cleveland:
 That's stupid. I ain't never heard of somebody live to sixty five.

John Goodman:
 It doesn't feel like a wednesday.

Peter:
 Ah Chris, you're not tardy. We tested you twice.

Peter:
 Well, I think we all learned something today.

Tom Tucker:
 In other news, TVs still make noise, even when people resume their conversation. [Lois and Chris start talking] Yes, studies have been telling that merely turning your head and speaking to your fat and gross family members will not deactivate a functioning television. How crazy is that? You actually have to turn the TV off to keep on going.

Stewie:
 Let's go ahead and turn off the TV.

Tom Tucker:
 There we go.

Stewie:
 Lois, stop making him reminisce about stuff.

Peter:
 Did I just do a racism?

Peter:
 I wanna watch all of these movies nonstop. [Eleven minutes later] I don't wanna watch any of these movies, ever.

Peter:
 [As Conway Twitty plays] This is annoying; I don't wanna sit through this.

Peter:
 Oh my God! He's just rhyming "danger zone" with "danger zone."

Peter:
 I'm trying to save our son, Lois. I don't want him to end up like me: dead end job, crappy house, aging wife who's getting skinny where  fat's supposed to be and fat where skinny's supposed to be.

Meg:
 Ha!

Lois:
 Meg, go to your room.

Chris:
 [Getting a nosebleed] Yay! My nose is finally a woman!

Meg:
 Augh. I got a skin tag in my crack and it stings when I don't wipe right.

Stewie:
 This has been a bad dinner.

Brian:
 [At a book club meeting] Let's "dog-ear" this for a sec. [Chuckles] This one gets it.

Chris:
 This is why you're so great, Dad. You don't pretend to be someone you're not; you do what you want. You don't care what anyone thinks.

Peter:
 Let's go get an $18 Coke at the terrible zoo restaurant.

Chris:
 Yay! Sticky tables covered in bees!

Peter:
 [Demonic voice] I see the six stations of the Lord's order, and they will all burn!

Lois:
 [To Brian] If you knew how close we were to putting you down last year.

Meg:
 I like her.

Joe:
 You're Heavy Flo!

Karen:
 In the flesh and blood.

Cleveland:
 Gross.

Peter:
 Man I love that song.

Stewie:
 Hey Meg, Thanksgiving's over. Come help me with the Christmas decorations...Meg! Help me with the Christmas decorations!

Peter:
 [To Steven Seagal] You act Asian; you look Native American; your name is possibly Jewish. What are you?

Cleveland:
 He fat.

Lois:
 And then I said something random, that suggested a whole crazy story!

Peter:
 Ugh. No, thanks. That old lady has ruined toothpicks for me. Just like how Meg ruined broccoli.

Peter:
 Hey, Meg, look, they're little trees!

Meg:
 No, they're not.

Peter:
 They're not?!

Joe:
 Hey, what are y'all doing?

Bonnie:
 Someone stop him!

Meg:
 Kill him, Dad! Murder him!

Brian:
 [Trying to pick up Tori] You know, some people are OK with a drive-through car wash. Me, I'm a fan of the hand job.

Brian:
 [Quietly] Shhh, be cool. This is the guy who's wife I'm banging.

Joe:
 It sure is cloudy today.

s teacher:
 Good, you could have also responded to Janet, who said her son died.

Joe:
 I'm sorry your son died on such a cloudy day.

Peter:
 Cleveland Jr.?

Peter:
 Oh my God!

Peter:
 Phew, heh. Unlike you, I dodged a bullet.

 Hartman:
 Okay, next is the Brown family...

 Hartman:
 Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry. Sometimes, I write descriptions of my patients to help me remember them.

Cleveland:
 No, it's okay. Our last name is Brown.

 Hartman:
 Ah, okay. Phew. Oh, so this must be Chubster Dumb Dumb.

Donna:
 You wouldn't have fired that gun if he was white!

Peter:
 That's not true, I'll shoot anybody. Joe, give me your gun.

Joe:
 Here you go...hey wait a second!

Stewie:
 Yeah, white paper. Check your jacket pocket.

Brian:
 "I don't think it's lost on any of us that the laws are written on white paper." Hey, look. I'm just saying. It's no surprise that justice isn't color blind.

Stewie:
 Check your other jacket pocket.

Brian:
 "Hey, look I'm just saying. It's no surprise that justice isn't color blind." Stewie, you're a jerk!

Stewie:
 Check Chris' pocket.

Brian:
 What? There's nothing in here and...Oh, God! The bottom of the pocket's been cut out!

Chris:
 Thanks, Brian. I was the mastermind behind this whole thing.

Brian:
 Boy, the world we live in, huh?

Chris:
 Brian, reach into Meg's pocket.

Meg:
 Go ahead, Brian.

Brian:
 I...I don't wanna.

Peter:
 Hey, how ya feeling there, champ?

Peter:
 Oh, I'm happy to hear that. Look, I hope you know. I'm sorry.

Cleveland:
 That's my boy.

Peter:
 What's that now?

Quagmire:
 I didn't care, I was living the life. Just banging chicks and eating cabbage, you know.

Sujin:
 Glenn, I have a surprise for you. Do you remember Buttercup?

Peter:
 Who's Buttercup?

Quagmire:
 Oh my God! I can't believe Buttercup is still alive!

Sujin:
 Alive and well.

Joe:
 Wait a minute, you named a cat Buttercup?  Ha ha ha, only Quagmire.

Sujin:
 And you know, Glenn. After you moved away, Buttercup had kittens.

Sujin:
 That's right. You're a grandfather.

Quagmire:
 My God, this is more pussy than even I can handle.

Cleveland:
 [thought] Is he gonna say "giggity"? Should I say "giggity"? Are other people allowed to say "giggity"? [speech] Giggity.

Peter:
 Wha?

Cleveland:
 Nothing, it's stupid.

Peter:
 That episode is not online anywhere. I even tried the Korean search engine, Bing Bong.

Quagmire:
 That's not real.

Peter:
 Alright, it's not.

Cleveland:
 Well, Donna's mother died, but we should probably head out to find the last episode of that Korean soap opera.

Peter:
 Hi, guys.

Joe:
 Peter? Are you alright?

Peter:
 You know what? I feel good. I feel like I want to giggle behind my hand at a lot of things and hold, but not eat a big ice cream cone.

Peter:
 Korean OMG!

Sujin:
 I'm so happy you all could make it tonight. We will have many things you will nibble at, but not eat. Then, I will give you a pizza.

Peter:
 Yeah, yeah, that's great. Can we watch that last episode of Winter Summer now?

Sujin:
 We will watch together after dinner. In the meantime, feel free to watch Korean pop videos.

Peter:
 What is this and how can I make the rest of my life about it?

Peter:
 Why? Why would American Johnny leave Korea? He had everything. Love, a family. Why would he go back to his sad pathetic life, back in America? He's got nothing there. Why would he ever want to go home? Okay, Quagmire. Let's go home.

Cleveland:
 Hey, Sinju, your TV says it's 21:00. What is that in real time?

Sujin:
 Tomorrow, you take her to town to buy root vegetable. After that, you will get psychopath haircut so you look like one of us.

Sujin:
 What's the matter, Glenn? You don't seem completely emotionless.

Quagmire:
 No, no, no, no, I am...I am...I'm...emotionless.

Adam West:
 I heard you gentlemen went to South Korea.

Adam West:
 Well, that's cool. We went to Lake Havasu, you losers. We nabbed so much college beave!

Peter:
 Dear God, it's the Griffins. Again, we're very sorry we cyber-bullied that girl to death, but we still want a snowmobile. Today though, please let there be money in our bank account. Amen.

Lois:
 This is serious. We need to think about our kids' education. Of course, it's already too late for Meg to go to college and Chris is too dumb to get in anywhere.

Chris:
 YAAAAAAY!!!

Stewie:
 No, Chris. Not Yay.

Stewie:
 Hey, don't fill up on that. We've got breakfast coming.

Peter:
 Hey Lois, check out what I found with my metal detector.

Peter:
 Yeah, some idiot buried like a hundred of them in this big lawn underneath bone cages.

Peter:
 Go, crappy car, go!

Bob:
 That was really great, Jake. Really, really great. Your face is upside down, so we're not going to pick you, but that was really great.

Meg:
 Hey, what's dad doing over there with Chris?

Lois:
 Oh, he's telling him that he's no longer his favorite son.

Chris:
 NOOOOO! NO! DADDY! No Daddy! Daddy!

Peter:
 I didn't even tell him. He just does not like to be touched.

Peter:
 Lois made us do this, but I wanted to go to the Central Park Merry-Go-Round.

Peter:
 We had time to do both!

Brian:
 Peter! You're giving your baby drugs to prove his acting career?

Peter:
 Oh, he's fine with it. Stewie, if you're fine with it, bleed from the nose.

Peter:
 I think that's pretty close.

Lois:
 Peter, did you get my text?

Peter:
 No, let me check.

Peter:
 No, I don't know what he's doing here.

Peter:
 You know, I was once a very famous baby.

Lois:
 Were you, Peter?

Peter:
 No, but you see how easy it is for me to lie to you? I do it every day.

Carter:
 [Excited] You have postcards from France?

Carter:
 Tear it all down, now! Or I'm canceling Kwanzaa.

Carter:
 Ha! I knew it wasn't real.

Groom:
 Thanks, everyone! Goodbye, Mom! Goodbye, Dad! Goodbye, friends! Goodbye, free time! Farewell, sex! So long, golf on TV! I'll miss you, privacy! Goodbye, being honest about how many beers I've had! Nice knowing you, my own choices! See you later, money!

Cleveland:
 It says ""Around the World", by Daft Punk."

Peter:
 Hey Cleveland, how'd you do that with your phone?

Peter:
 Okay, before you do anything else, I'm deathly allergic to pineapple, pork, rum, macadamia nuts, stupid tiny guitars, overpriced golf, sentimental military stuff, lava, people who I can't tell are black or Asian, apostrophes, anyone twirling flames, second weddings, and linen pants.

Hawaiian woman:
 Is there anything you're not allergic to?

Peter:
 Yeah, the Epcot Center, where I wanted to go.

Principal Shepherd:
 Thank you for coming Mr. and Mrs. Griffin. We've got a bit of a situation, which is why I've asked Officer Swanson to join us. It appears Chris sent an inappropriate photo of himself to one of his classmates.

Joe:
 That's right. He texted a picture of his peenie.

Lois:
 Oh my God!

Principal Shepherd:
 And apparently the girl-

Peter:
 Oh, thank God.

Tom:
 Coming up, teleprompter puts the period in a weird. place

Quagmire:
 Hey, Chris. I see you walked across the grass again instead of using the walk. You're really wearing a path aren't you? We call that "Chris' trail" right there. Chris' trail.

Chris:
 Hey, can I ring your doorbell?

Quagmire:
 No, I'd rather you...

Quagmire:
 That's why no, Chris! That's why no!

Chris:
 I don't have to do anything besides get to the windchime store before it closes.

Peter:
 There can't be a whole store.

Chris:
 To be fair, they also have a couple of kaleidoscopes.

Peter:
 Aw, can I come? Lois, can I go to the store with that thing?

Brian:
 Look, I'm just happy you pushed me because now, I can't wait for that tournament.

Stewie:
 I know, it's gonna be great and I already know exactly where I'm gonna put that trophy!

Stewie:
 [angry] Are you shitting me? That thing was in! You're gonna penalise us because you're a blind, fucking, blue jacket piece of shit?!

Marcy:
 Wow, that was really something.

Chris:
 Marcy?

Marcy:
 I had no idea you were such an amazing tutor and I really like your pendant.

Chris:
 Thanks, but, why are you being so nice to me? You got me in so much trouble before.

Marcy:
 Yeah, I'm really sorry about that. That was just my dumb, overprotective dad.

Marcy:
 Yeah. He took my phone to look at pictures of my friends and he found the one you sent.

Chris:
 I bet that caught him by surprise.

Marcy:
 Definitely.

Chris:
 Well, I hope you know, that's not who I am anymore.

Marcy:
 I do and I hope I didn't cause too much trouble.

Boss:
 This is not a drill! I repeat, not a drill!

Unnamed Worker:
 Good to be back doing this again, huh, Bill?

Bill:
 What? Shoveling coal into a penis? I was sleeping.

Lois:
 Well, Chris, you killed that librarian, but we're glad to have you back to your old self.

Meg:
 Mrs. LaPorter worked at that school for 54 years.

Peter:
 Well, at least she saw a little wang before taking that dirt nap.

Joe:
 Oh, look at his face. He looks like Oliver Platt climbing a flight of stairs.

Oliver:
 Hey, that's a low blow. I'm gonna call the network and complain. Where's the phone?

Camilia:
 It's upstairs, Oliver.

Oliver :
 Ah, they know what they did.

Quagmire:
 Tell ya what, Peter. I'll give you ten bucks if you drink an entire shot glass of the hot sauce.

Peter:
 Let me see the money.

Quagmire:
 Y...You don't believe I have ten dollars?

Stewie:
 Oh, hey, Bri. Still sitting in chairs, huh? What did your back ever do to you?

Brian:
 I'm trying to watch.

Stewie:
 You know what I'm watching? My core. Your body and mind are supposed to be on the same team.

Stewie:
 Sitting on the hard floor is good for your back too.

Lois:
 Peter, is there something you wanna tell me?

Peter:
 Uh, yeah. Every light in the house is on.

Lois:
 Did you destroy the library?

Peter:
 Did I destroy the library? Hah, No, Lois. That was television.

Opie:
 Well, I do miss drinking, but I have used the time to reconnect with my children and I have been thinking about resuming my actuarial practice.

Peter:
 Oh my God, he's just been drunk this whole time?

Joe:
 This new law sucks. I gotta say, it's pretty uncool of Mayor West to call it Peter's Law.

Peter:
 No kidding. Now I know how Megan from Megan's law felt.

Joe:
 Peter, why'd you want me to get me into this prison?

Peter:
 Because, Joe, everybody knows that all prisoners make bootleg wine in their toilet. We are gonna get so wasted. Oh, look, right here. This one's full of chardonnay.

Joe:
 Peter, I don't think that's...

Peter:
 [Narration] But it was chardonnay. The best chardonnay I've ever had in my life. The man who made it, Curtis "Murder Dog" Williams, went on to become one of America's most celebrated vintners

Joe:
 [Narration] Hey, Joe here. Peter's lying, he drank pee-pee.

Cop:
 Hey, what's going on here?

Peter:
 Uh, some butthorn is shining a flashlight on me?

Cop:
 I meant prior to me coming up and investigating this.

Peter:
 Oh, well you gotta be clearer man, I'm wasted.

Cop:
 Sir, I'm gonna need to see some ID. You look underage.

Cop:
 Just as I suspected, you're a minor.

Peter:
 It ain't my fault! Somebody's been buying it for me and all my friends!

Cop:
 Oh, is that right? Well you'd better tell me who that is or you're in a lot of trouble!

Brian:
 Hey is this the park where Boner died? Wait, what's going on?

Peter:
 That's him officer! That's who's been buying us the booze!

Brian:
 What!?

Cop:
 [To Peter] You get home son. You're lucky I'm letting you off with a warning, [To Brian] but you, you're coming with me.

Chris:
 Yay! Everybody's happy! I love this family!

Stewie:
 I draped that over him. He was just doing it out in the open.

Peter:
 Don't worry, we'll put you in soon.

Fouad:
 Oh-ho-ho! It's funny because you won't be back!

Brian:
 Alright Stewie, time to tackle your fears. Now, it sounds like you're scared of monsters, so to help you get over it, here's Frankenstein.

Chris:
 Ugh, I'm Frankenstein. I'm actually really nice. There's no need to be scared of me. Arrrrrgh!

Stewie:
 Seriously? This is obviously Chris in a costume.

Brian:
 Huh, well that can't be possible because here comes Chris walking in the door right now.

Meg:
 Hey, hey, hey! Here comes Chris Griffin! A rootily toot toot!

Stewie:
 Yeah, okay, whatever Meg.

Mayor West:
 Meg? You must be talking about me. A rootily toot toot!

Stewie:
 [To Brian] Do they all say "A rootily toot toot?"

Brian:
 A lot of them, yeah.

Stewie:
 You and I will place these cranial impulse receptor caps on our heads, I shall begin my slumber and...

Brian:
 And then this thing will actually allow me to enter your dream?

Stewie:
 That's right, Brian. I want you to come inside me while I'm asleep.

Brian:
 No, don't say it like that.

Stewie:
 Your job is to stop these nightmares by finding that monster and killing him. This isn't a job for the meek, Brian. When you get in there, you've got to be hard.

Stewie:
 [In the form of Elmo] Hi, Brian! Elmo speak bad English on educational show! Ha ha ha ha ha!

Stewie:
 Aaaaaah! That one trip to the petting zoo really messed me up! I saw too much!

Student:
 Ha ha! Stewie's naked!

Stewie:
 What? [The other students laugh] Oh my God! Don't look! Don't look! Cell phones down! Cell phones down!

Lois:
 Damn it, Peter, are you guys playing lawn darts in the attic again?

Peter:
 No. Yay! Lawn darts! Peter wins lawn darts! She's dumb; she got no idea.

Tom Tucker:
 Adult stuff. Adult stuff. Adult stuff. The world is scary. Adult stuff. Adult stuff. Scary people yelling at another part of the world. Adult stuff.

Elmer Hartman:
 I would've been here sooner, but one of my legs is a snake that's very hungry for mice.

Elmer Hartman:
 Nice shot. Get it? Shot? All right, bye!

Stewie:
 [To Brian] You've been more of a father figure to me than the Fat Man ever has been or ever will be. Look, I know I'm always busting your balls, but it's just because you're the only person in this house whose judgment actually matters to me.

Quagmire:
 I might need two weeks off from this friendship.

Tom Tucker:
 Coming up, a map with a hurricane on it and [demonic voice] you don't know your STATES yet!

Stewie:
 Ugh, I'll have to text Rupert about what a train wreck this is.

Stewie:
 [angrily to Lois] Hey! I want real things!

Bonnie:
 I'd better go downstairs before Joe realizes I'm gone and before Peter gets into the stuff that's not for the party.

Peter:
 [offscreen] Aw! Halloween Candy!

Joe:
 [offscreen] Peter, get out of the pantry!

 Abbott:
 Kids, this morning, Principal Shepherd wanted to say a few words.

Principal Shepherd:
 Thank you, Mrs. Abbott. Now, before we start, are these the normal kids or kind of the durr durr ones?

 Abbott:
 It's a healthy mix.

Principal Shepherd:
 Good morning, children. It's that time of the year again to fulfill your community service requirement by signing up for volunteer work.

Meg:
 Do we get to choose our own jobs?

Principal Shepherd:
 No, no, no. The jobs will be assigned randomly, but the cooler and prettier students have the better jobs. For instance, blonde chick on the third row will wash my car this afternoon, while little miss frumpkin with all the questions will work in an old folk's home?

Meg:
 Is frumpkin good?

Principal Shepherd:
 [laughing] No-ho-ho-ho-ho, no.

Peter:
 What!?

Meg:
 Mrs. Parkers, I'm Meg, your new student volunteer.

 Parkers:
 Ah, you must be my new student volunteer.

Meg:
 Yeah, I just said that.

 Parkers:
 What's your name dear?

Meg:
 It's Meg. Can I ... can I get a new person?

 Parkers:
 Nonsense, come in and between you and me, I hate my new student volunteer. That ugly little Meg. She says she's a girl, but she certainly has a boy's body odor.

 Parkers:
 [to Meg] Shut up! I'm trying to hum atonally!

Mayor West:
 Sick broach!

 West:
 Adam, are you done with mayor homework yet?

Mayor West:
 It's called a bill, mom!

Brian:
 Guys, thanks again for doing this. Joe has been making my life Hell.

Lois:
 Of course. Alright, when Joe get's here, we're telling him he needs to lighten up on Brian and then we'll all talk this thing out, so we can move past it.

Peter:
 And then I get to show my card trick?

Lois:
 If there's time.

Peter:
 Let's make this quick.

Joe:
 I'm not the guy who violated the sanctity of someone else's marriage!

Cleveland:
 Well, you make a good point Joe, and you're right, this is Brian. We all know he don't care where he gets his wick wet. Just ask Quagmire's father.

Bonnie:
 Screw you! You tweet things that aren't worth tweeting!

Brian:
 Well, I'm sorry, but Kim Kardashian did get famous for making a sex tape!

Bonnie:
 We all know that! That's not yours and stop breathing through your mouth. It's really annoying!

Brian:
 Wow, I am sorry. Look, thi ... this isn't us. This is just the no food and sleeping in a car talking. We can make this work, like couples who meet on Craig's list.

Both:
 [deadpan] You're not what you looked like in your picture, let's get this over with.

Man:
 I wonder which one of us is the murderer.

 Parkers:
 Look at you two, stealing from the elderly! You're worse than that Juliette Lewis, who makes out with dogs!

Chris:
 Wait, is that a real thing? Where did you hear that? Where are your sources?

Bonnie:
 Joe? How did you find me?

Joe:
 Love is a powerful compass. Every time I quiet my mind and clear my heart, it always leads me to you, plus dirtbag here has a chip in his ear.

Brian:
 I do? Dammit, no wonder Peter's so good at hide and seek.

Peter:
 You're under the canoe in Quagmire's yard.

Brian:
 [Offscreen] Son of a bitch!

Brian:
 Wow. I guess just call me Cupid, huh? You're welcome.

Brian:
 Ow, dammit! Uuuggh! Ugh! Ugh!

Stewie:
 Hey, Bri. Here to try that apple pie, you were texting about. Oh, you're shot.

Lois:
 I don't want Stewie in that school anymore. It seems like it's really gone downhill.

Stewie:
 She's not wrong to worry. There's a sign in the bathroom that says "If it's brown, let it mellow." Sometimes it crests the toilet lid.

Cleveland:
 Oh no, it's that Amazon drone! Try to ignore it.

Drone:
 Hey, Cleveland, what are you doing? Taking a walk?

Cleveland:
 No, I'm delivering mail.

Drone:
 By foot? Yeah, that won't take too long. Well, gotta go. Gotta deliver these fat pants to your fat son.

Cleveland:
 He was harsh, but not untruthful. We gotta special order Junior's pants that manufactures grill covers.

Bonnie:
 You could always just ask Peter about it.

Lois:
 No, he won't talk about anything serious, unless there's a crackling fire to punctuate uncomfortable family revelations.

Lois:
 I didn't fall off the roof, I jumped.

Peter:
 I never found you attractive, and once more, I never respected you.

Lois:
 I know about Maurice.

Peter:
 Which Maurice?

Stewie:
 I'll be as popular as the first kid in school to get his driver's license.

Peter:
 Gretchen? Wow, you look great.

Gretchen:
 Yeah, I didn't have kids.

Gretchen:
 Well, my answer is yes, Peter. Yes, I will marry you!

Peter:
 Gretchen, I am already happily ... moderately hap ... I am ... I am married.

Gretchen:
 Oh, then I suppose your wife is entitled to know that you were still in love with me, just days before your wedding.

Peter:
 Blackmail!

Peter:
 Thank you, Cleveland ... and I don't know what to call the thing you're doing to me, lady!

Stewie:
 Please let me explain! I was just worried you wouldn't accept me because ... I'm not wealthy like you.

Chadley:
 Stewie, it's not that you're poor. It's that you lied to us and you're poor.

House Owner:
 Excuse me, is one of you Chadley? You left your wallet inside.

Stewie:
 [mischievously] Chicka chicka!

House Owner:
 Well, that "chicka chicka" makes me think that you're not Chadley.

Stewie:
 Oh no, I "chicka chicka-d" too early!

Peter:
 Ooh! A text! [reading text] I'm taking care of our problem. We'll be together soon. Love, Gretchen. [to Meg] Meg, you're kind of a loner psychopath. What does this mean?

Meg:
 Oh, this woman is clearly a spurring lover who's planning to kill Mom.

Peter:
 Ah, thank you ... Aaaaah! ... You're a good dog, Meg ... Aaaaah!

Peter:
 Now, let's get it on through a PO box.

Lois:
 Peter, this isn't working.

Peter:
 Well, I'm in full go, are you sure you're in the right box?

Peter:
 Box 528?

Lois:
 Yes, 528!

Peter:
 Alright, just reach in and grab it.

TV Announcer:
 We now return to The Price is Right, now with male models.

Drew Carey:
 Now, let's look at your new car, presented by Ken.

Contestant:
 I don't want it.

Peter:
 Hi, uh, I'll take two tickets for the ladybug express, please.

Ticket Guy:
 Sorry, the train is just for children.

Peter:
 Well, what about that guy in the front? He's a grown up.

Ticket Guy:
 He's the conductor.

Peter:
 I don't see no orchestra.

Ticket Guy:
 That's a different kind of conductor.

Peter:
 Okay, well, if he's the conductor, why don't he have electrical tape wrapped around him for safety?

Ticket Guy:
 Also a different kind of conductor.

Peter:
 Alright, thanks for joking around with me. We're gonna go check out the rest of the mall.

Brian:
 Huh, I know I left the ring right here.

Chris:
 If you're referring to the ring I thought was a lug nut, I ate it.

Brian:
 What? Why would you eat a lug nut?

Chris:
 I was dared.

Brian:
 By who?

Chris:
 By myself. I have low self-esteem.

Stewie:
 We should check in on this guy more.

Chris:
 Uh, yeah. I'll take the Angus steak meal.

Cashier:
 I'm sorry, are you here to poop something out?

Cashier:
 Okay, this line is just for regular diners, you need to get in that line.

Guy:
 Excuse me, is this the line for people who need to puke something up?

Stewie:
 I think this is just the poop line.

Stewie:
 [to the camera] You know which restaurant we're talking about.

Lois:
 Peter, you were the one who told Tom Tucker to try all that nonsense on TV? You realise you cost that man his job!

Peter:
 Well, how was I supposed to know? Katie Couric stuck a tube up her butt and they threw her a parade!

Lois:
 That was a colonoscopy!

Chris:
 You know, Brian. This wouldn't have happened if you were just honest with women and had an ounce of integrity.

Brian:
 Don't pull rank on me, you ate a ring, you fat tub of crap.

Chris:
 Yeah? Well, who's gonna be fishing through a tub of crap soon, you unemployed buttmunch?

Tom:
 I was born to be a newsman.

Tom:
 This just out, me!

Brian:
 [Offscreen] Hey, Shelby.

Shelby:
 [Offscreen] Brian?

Chris:
 [Offscreen] Aaaaagh! It's coming!

Shelby:
 [Offscreen] Oh my God!

Brian:
 [Offscreen] Yes, um, I'd like to make a return please, and maybe take you to dinner?

Shelby:
 [Offscreen] Brian, I don't care that I was diarrhea-ed on. I care that you weren't honest.

Stewie:
 [Offscreen] I care that I was diarrhea-ed on. I care a great deal.

Tom:
 Tell us, crazy person, why are you doing all this?

Peter:
 I'll tell you why. I'm doing this because I ruined a guy's life and I feel awful about it. It's the only thing I can think of to make things right.

Tom:
 Well, whoever this guy is, I'm sure he appreciates whatever you're trying to do for him. I think I speak for all our viewers when I say, don't do this. Please, come down off this ledge with me.

Peter:
 You got it. If that's what the most trusted newsman in Quahog wants.

Peter:
 Aaah! Pigeon!

Peter:
 It's fine, he landed on people.

Principal Shepherd:
 [over the intercom] Attention students, this is Principal Shepherd with the lunchtime announcements and as a special treat, I thought I'd deliver them in the rapping style, you kids are so enthused about. [singing] Later today, you're gonna have a big thrill because shortly after lunch, there'll be a fire drill and when you go to wait for the bus, unnn, go in order or your hair will get mussed.

Kid:
 You suck!

Principal Shepherd:
 No, you suck! I can't hear you, I just presumed somebody said you suck. Anyway, last announcement. Don't forget, it's time to vote for homecoming king and queen. Nominations are due by 3pm today. Peace out! ... No, you're a douchebag!

Chris:
 Well, voting is tomorrow, so I gotta write my speech. Luckily, Chris Griffin rhymes with homecoming king, so I've got my opening line.

Principal Shepherd:
 Alright, now it's time for these four poor kids to thank you for subsidising their lunches.

Poor Kids:
 [depressingly] Thank you.

Principal Shepherd:
 Mean it!

Poor Kids:
 [forced] Thank you!

Brian:
 They had security guards in the bathroom! We ... we live in such a culture of fear now.

Stewie:
 Oh my God, they just elected him out of pity because they think he's mentally challenged.

Brian:
 Kind of like we did with George W. Bush, huh? [laughs] Right?

Stewie:
 [sigh] I ... I guess ... I guess, Brian. I ... I don't ... I don't know. Let's just watch some commercials.

Padma:
 So, what seems to be the problem?

Padma:
 Then why don't you just buy a new computer?

Padma:
 Oh, I am just bursting your balls.

Stewie:
 I can't believe we're really in India. Oh, look over there. Those cute little kids are playing Cowboys and Indians and Indians.

Padma:
 Brian?

Brian:
 Padma!

Padma:
 Why are you here?

Stewie:
 Let's go get sandwiches at that "new deli" I keep hearing about.

Stewie:
 Thanks, Ganesha.

Lois:
 Brian, this does not seem appropriate to watch in front of the baby.

Stewie:
 Not appropriate? You took me to see Magic Mike XXL.

Lois:
 Oh, this one's wet. Ugh, this one too. Also wet. Huh, this one's dry, but the back of the seat in front of it is wet.

Stewie:
 Ooh, I'm excited. This'll be great and those guys back at the factory can suck it.

Stewie:
 I'm gunna get out of this place one day.

Female Worker:
 Hey, Butch. Get a load of Stewie. He says he's gonna get out of here.

Stewie:
 You don't know me, man. I'm different. I got ideas.

Female Worker:
 Hey, Butch. You hear that? Stewie's got ideas.

Stewie:
 Shut up! I'm gonna go across that river and make it to the city on the other side. I'm gonna be a singer.

Female Worker:
 Bubl  over here says he's gonna be a singer.

Male Worker:
 Hey, Bubl . I got a tune for you to sing. It's called "Get your ass back on the forklift. Lunch is over."

Butch:
 Hey, Stewie. Don't listen to those guys. Follow your heart.

Stewie:
 Shut up, Butch. You're the loser of this crew. Hey guys. You hear that? Butch told me to follow my heart!

Chris:
 I can't work. I'm too young.

Peter:
 Well, Will Smith's little kid works as a movie star, even though he looks like a wet baby horse.

Peter:
 Chris is looking for work. Maybe he can help you out. Be your assistant.

Quagmire:
 Huh, maybe. [to Chris] Do you have any references?

Chris:
 Uh, Cowabunga, Schwing, Yadda Yadda Yadda.

Quagmire:
 Those are pretty good references. You're hired.

Olivia:
 Stewie? Oh, I thought that was you.

Stewie:
 Hey, Olivia, Hey! What brings you here?

Olivia:
 Oh, the birthday boy and I met at Burt Reynolds' acting camp in Jupiter, Florida.

Stewie:
 Well, I'm glad to hear you're still acting. You know, the last time I saw you, you were...

Olivia:
 Burning in a cardboard house?

Stewie:
 Yep, burning in a cardboard house, yeah.

Olivia:
 Great crowd babe.

Brian:
 What are you...what is this?

Stewie:
 Oh Olivia is the president of our fan club. She's also doing half the band.

Brian:
 Do you even know what that means?

Stewie:
 Uh let's just say I couldn't toddle right for a week.

Brian:
 Okay you know.

Olivia:
 Alright if you'll excuse me I have a poo poo diaper.

Petting Zoo Guy:
 It's a hot crowd out there. Have fun out there. I'm gonna go feed everything in my van to each other.

Peter:
 Oh, hey, Chris. How's the job hunt going?

Chris:
 Terrible. I can't find a job anywhere. A lot of people seem to be turned off by my dishonorable discharge.

Peter:
 What, from the army?

Chris:
 No, it's a euphemism.

Peter:
 Oh, yucky.

Brian:
 Hey, let's keep this party rolling. I'll go get us another badly scratched pitcher of soda.

Olivia:
 Ugh, finally, he's doing something useful.

Stewie:
 What? What do you mean?

Olivia:
 Nothing, it's just, you write all the songs, you've got a better voice, you've got the sweet bod.

Stewie:
 Oh my God, babe.

Olivia:
 Plus, you've got all the cool catchphrases like "Damn you all" and "What the dude" or whatever.

Stewie:
 Uh, it's ... it's "Deuce", uh but yeah ... yeah ... yeah you're right. I ... I do. Does it sound through the mic like I'm saying "Dude?" Should it be "Dude?"

Quagmire:
 You know, you're doing a great job, Chris. Why don't you jerk the rest of the day off?

Olivia:
 The clock is ticking on Stewie's cuteness.

Brian:
 Huh. Well, I guess you're right. I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if he end up looking like an exact mash-up of Lois and Peter.

Stewie:
 Heh heh heh heh heh heh, groceries.

Stewie:
 Fine, go ahead! It's not going to be the same! Like Cheers wasn't the same when they brought in Kirstie Alley!

Crew:
 Norm!

Rebecca:
 No, I'm ... I'm Rebecca.

Peter:
 Meg, do you know how to use Microsoft Excel?

Meg:
 Yeah, I'm actually pretty good.

Peter:
 Yeah, you would, dork!

Peter:
 But, I do need to make that spread sheet or I'm fired.

Lois:
 Oh my God! Peter, our dishwasher is full of sex toys!

Peter:
 Oh, yeah. Chris put those in there. It's for his job. He's working for Quagmire now.

Lois:
 He's washing sex toys for Quagmire?

Peter:
 Not just that, he also takes pictures of Quagmire's genitals and to track sore growth. So brace yourself when you open iphoto. It's on the Griffin family account.

Lois:
 Peter, my parents have access to that.

Carter:
 What's wrong with this worm?

Lois:
 That's it. I'm calling Quagmire right now and putting an end to this.

Chris:
 You have reached Glenn Quagmire. Neither he nor his assistant is available. To schedule a liaison, press one. To cancel a liaison, press two. If you're calling to report a pregnancy, please fill out our online form, and we will mail you a check for $180. Thank you, a have a giggity day. [Beep]

Lois:
 Chris, this is your mother. Get these dildos out of the dishwasher.

Mort:
 Well, that's what I got for horsing around.

Peter:
 Ah, your joke wasn't funny enough.

Stewie:
 Hey, I wonder if she's gonna keep the band going.

Brian:
 Probably. She told me she was just gonna replace me with another dog.

Stewie:
 Yes, but who?

Brian:
 I don't know. Probably some dog neither you or I have ever met.

Vinny:
 Alright, listen up you little pieces of garbage. This song is about getting heart-burn from baked clams and other kid stuff.

Stewie:
 This is a bad start to whatever we're doing.

Lois:
 Ohhhh.

Peter:
 See, I listen.

Coach Doyle:
 Hey! Which one of you threw that apple at my car?

Peter:
 He did it. He dragged me out here. I wanted to be in school sir.

Coach Doyle:
 Where'd you get a cannon like that kid?

Chris:
 I work out my right arm three times a day.

Coach Doyle:
 Hmm, free weights?

Chris:
 No, mostly jpegs of Helen Hunt on my hard drive.

Peter:
 Alright, Chris! Wow, I've never seen him run onto a baseball field when he wasn't chasing a duck or being chased by a duck. Is that a duck over there?

Chris:
 Oh my God, A duck!

Chris:
 It was a trap!

Peter:
 This sucks even worse than when I stubbed my toe.

Peter:
 Aaagh! Why does everything bad always happen to me!?

Peter:
 Answer me, guy in box and guy on cross!

Peter:
 Hey, champ. Whatchya doin'?

Chris:
 My Spanish homework.

Peter:
 Oh, well then maybe I'll just say this to you in Spanish. Chris, estoy muy contento que usted tenido un  xito en el b isbol, pero, ahora quiero que pierdas intencionalmente el gran juego.

Chris:
 Bueno, yo estoy feliz que este teniendo un inter s en mis actividades y ha sido muy divertido para...  QUEEEEEEE?

Lois:
 Chris, what the hell are you doing?

Chris:
 Calm down, this is how they package Snapple now. They're trying to trick kids into drinking it.

Lois:
 You may not believe this, but there was a time when Snapple ruled the nation.

Chris:
 Preposterous!

Lois:
 It's true, even Jerry Seinfeld drank it and he was the president of the 90's.

Stewie:
 Hey, Frank. We've got to talk. You've got to stop giving away all the food for free.

Brian:
 Yeah, otherwise there's no way we're gonna make a profit.

Stewie:
 Uh huh, that's wrong. Anyway, the restaurant's going to go under if you keep giving away food.

Stewie:
 Thank you, Frank. I appreciate you trying it my way.

Brian:
 What was that?

Chris:
 Oh, hey, fellow teens. Wait a minute, teenagers don't have wheelchairs!

Brian:
 [To Lois] Wow, what a day!

Lois:
 [Ignoring Stewie] Oh, look at you. Did you get a job?

Peter:
 Are you ... Are you gay?

Who Else But Quagmire Guy:
 Uh, of course not, but I'm unable to properly have sex with my wife so I figured, you know, who else but Quagmire?

Customer:
 Can you tell me where I can find extension cords?

Brian:
 Aisle 25.

Customer:
 I was just there.

Brian:
 26.

Customer:
 There is no 26.

Brian:
 15.

Peter:
 [offscreen] Hello? Hey Quagmire, what's going on? Oh, you need a ride? Yeah, sure, I can come get you. I'm not doing anything.

Janitor:
 Meg, that was the last guy, so just lock up when you're done.

Lois:
 Is ... is it your line?

Chris:
 I don't ... uh, I don't think so.

Stewie:
 I'm ... I'm sorry, who's line is it?

Lois:
 Well, it certainly isn't easy being in a family that also happens to star in a sitcom together. Especially last year when I discovered those naked pictures of that eighteen year old intern on Peter's phone, but he explained that his phone number was the old number of ... uh ... of her ex-boyfriend, so ... what was it again? ... So, the cloud. That's right. So, the photos were on the cloud and the ... the ... the cloud pulled the pictures uh ... I mean, even if the pictures had not been sent directly to him and ... that's why he has them and we both called the Apple store and they said that they can't disprove that it doesn't happen and so, here we are. Still married. Still on the show ... and ... and it's happened five times since then ... some of the pictures have both Peter and the girl in them.

Peter:
 Oh, yeah. It's great, you know, doing the show with your family, cuz what guy doesn't want to go to his office and have his family there? You know, and then you go home after work and catch up with the family, [progressively gets more depressed as he keeps talking] and then uh ... next day same thing. Just trying to make it through the weekend, so you can uh ... spend some time with the family ... Isn't that the dream?

James Woods:
 It's not just the Griffins who work hard to make Family Guy what it is. Here in the props department, some sweaty guy is working on the Petercopter.

Sweaty Guy:
 That's right. You know, a lot of people don't realize, SEAL Team Six actually completed their mission in this puppy.

Quagmire:
 Look, don't get me wrong guys. I think it's hilarious ... and I totally get that the sex thing is what made me popular, but ... would it kill us to just once tell a joke that brings glory to God?

Peter:
 You know I'm only tough on you cuz I hate you, right?

Meg:
 Dad refuses to interact with any actors on set. He'll only rehearse with helium balloons with crudely drawn faces on them.

Peter:
 I'm sorry Meg, but you're grounded.

Meg:
 [Over the walky talky] But dad, the prom is tonight, over.

Lois:
 [Over the walky talky] You hear your father, Meg, over.

Joe:
 Peter, you ready to hit the Drunken Clam, over?

Stewie:
 The fat man's behavior has been deteriorating overtime ... and I think someone may have placed an anonymous phone call to the network about it?

Stewie:
 You have no idea how bad it is here! He screams and yells and he makes a V with his fingers and then licks it, like "luh-luh-luh-luh-luh", which I am to understand is something dirty! Please do something! And, if possible, I'd love a "Master Chef" T-shirt.

Brian:
 Word around the stage is, they've decided to finally fire Peter and replace him with another actor.

Lois:
 And this time, it's permanent. Not like when we killed off Brian for a few episodes so he could shoot that crappy movie. What ... what was it?

Brian:
 It was a remake of Old Yeller where the dog gets the drop on him and kills him first.

Travis:
 I'm sorry.

Brian:
 [Pulls a gun on Travis] No, I'm sorry. [Shoots Travis]

Brian:
 They miscalculated the number of dogs who buy movie tickets.

Meg:
 But, he'll find out tomorrow at the table read.

Adam West:
 This is how we did that. Bet you didn't know.

Gary:
 Okay, everybody. Welcome to the table read for this week's episode, entitled "Peter dies. We're really serious. No joke. He's dead and never coming back."

Peter:
 Oh, and there's other pages. You gotta turn them. Here, let me show ya.

Gary:
 Interior: Griffin's living room, day. Brian, Meg, and Chris watch TV, Lois enters, upset.

Lois:
 You guys, I have terrible news. Your father is dead. He was shot in the head, while killing himself. I suppose he had his demons and his enemies.

Peter:
 Wait, I'm ... I'm what? Oh .. oh I know. Stewie's gonna fire up his time machine and undo this.

Gary:
 Stewie enters.

Stewie:
 Brian, bad news. My time machine got a virus that causes dad to die again if it's ever used.

Peter:
 Oh, well you know what? I bet this is all Chris' dream.

Chris:
 Wow! I am wide awake.

Peter:
 Okay, but ... there's no way this is real. They'd have to bring in someone to replace me.

Gary:
 Uncle Ricky, played by sitcom buzzard, David Spade enters.

David Spade:
 Hi, everybody.

Family:
 Uncle Ricky!

David Spade:
 Hey guys, a time period called. They want an object back.

Chris:
 Aw, do we have to go to dad's funeral? Let's just play with Uncle Ricky instead.

Gary:
 The family cheers. They do not miss Peter.

s Partner:
 I'm sorry Peter, but the production just can't deal with all your nonsense anymore. We're letting you go.

Peter:
 Oh, please. Don't do this! I'm begging you just give me one more chance!

s Partner:
 [Sighs] Okay, fine.

s Partner:
 Alright, that's it! You're fired!

James Woods:
 Welcome back to Inside Family Guy. I'm your host and angel investor to The Fappening, James Woods.

Guy:
 This is the planet Jew-piter and he could say "Next year is my Star-mitzvah!"

Live Studio Ostrich:
 Ha ha!

Peter:
 Hey, did I get any mail?

Hotel Manager:
 Yes, your death threats to Grimace have been returned.

Peter:
 Well, has the Shamrock shake period been extended?

Lois:
 I have to admit it's a little strange taping a show without Peter. It just doesn't feel right.

Stewie:
 I'm especially going to miss the fat man's bit with the audience, where he fires the T-shirt cannon at his own head. You know he once tried to hold up a store with that thing?

Peter:
 Alright, everybody on the floor! Empty the register!

Guy:
 Please, don't do this!

Peter:
 Oh, yeah? You wanna be a hero? Here's what happens to heroes!

Peter:
 Anybody else wanna be a hero?

Other Guy:
 Ooh! Me! Me! Me! Over here! Over here!

Peter:
 The fact is, I got too big for my britches, but I know now that ... I'm nothing without all of you.

Stewie:
 Aw, that's nice of you to say.

Peter:
 Thank you, Stewie, who I can understand.

Stewie:
 Oh my God! Am I about to introduce you to Taylor Swift?

Stewie:
 [talking to Taylor Swift] Okay, so let's talk about Harry Styles. Now, you don't have to say anything. I'm just gonna slowly pull out this tape measure, and you indicate when I should stop. Okay, here I go.

Stewie:
 Still going ... still going ... Oh my God, you bitch! Seriously?

Chris:
 Taylor, this is our sister, Meg and our dog, Brian.

Taylor:
 Nice to meet you both.

Meg:
 We're not all so impressed. I've met Dan Aykroyd.

Brian:
 I'm sorry, uh, which cast member of Hee Haw are you?

Stewie:
 WILL YOU BE NICE!?

Chris:
 Sorry about my family.

Taylor:
 Don't apologize. They seem nice.

Chris:
 Well, you wouldn't say that if you ever saw us at the movies.

Peter:
 Alright, we got our popcorn from home, our soda from home, our snacks from home and Braveheart.

Guy:
 Hey, what's up? I'm just going to Quahog Stadium.

Peter:
 Okay, would you like the AC on or the windows down?

Guy:
 How 'bout both?

Peter:
 Gasp!

Guy:
 Pretty great right?

Peter:
 It is! It really is! Thank you, genius person!

Guy:
 No problem. Hey, you ever go in a hot tub while it's snowing outside?

Peter:
 UH ... WHAT!?

Brian:
 You might want to see this video Bonnie posted on Facebook.

Lois:
 Why are you on Bonnie's Facebook page?

Meg:
 'Cause she's a fuckin' smoke-show.

Secretary:
 Ms. Swift, your song writing team is here.

Old Man:
 We've got a socko tune for you, Taylor. Hit it, Morty. [singing] Lox and bagels and bagels and lox. I like being a girl.

Taylor:
 Okay, one thought. What if we changed "lox" to "boys" and "bagels" to "problems".

Old Man:
 Oh, that's good! Like when you changed "Pickle it good" to "Shake it off".

Chris:
 Hi, Taylor.

Taylor:
 Chris? What are you guys doing here?

Chris:
 I wanted to talk to you.

Stewie:
 Your house is way nicer than Anne Murray's. We broke in there too.

Stewie:
 Ow! You can beat me, but I am who I am!

 Hartman:
 Good news. Stewie's hand looks fine.

Peter:
 Oh, hey. High five.

Brian:
 I can't believe you guys. Don't you realize you're contributing to a potential public health disaster by not vaccinating your child?

Lois:
 That's exactly the point. My child. He's my child and nothing matters more than his well-being.

Stewie:
 Oh, God. This is gonna be a Lois story, isn't it? [to the camera] Game of Thrones is on. Just a reminder.

Peter:
 We made this mistake before. We got the other kids vaccinated, but Meg still got chicken pox.

Meg:
 Dad, this is acne.

Peter:
 Girl, you nasty.

Peter:
 The brothers who made The Matrix are ladies now!

Stewie:
 Proper hygiene depends on everyone, Brian. For instance, I've already saran wrapped Chris.

Chris:
 I'm a gas station sandwich!

Peter:
 I knew one of these had to be my house.

Peter:
 Who's up for another game of hot breath telephone? [whispers in Chris' ear]

Chris:
 WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!

Peter:
 Chris, you're supposed to whisper that to the next person.

Lois:
 Oh my God, Peter! You've got measles!

Peter:
 Now hold on. Hold on. Before we all freak out, it might just be full body herpes.

Meg:
 Wait, you guys, dad might not have been vaccinated. Didn't Grandma say he was born in Mexico?

Peter:
 Nobody remembers that, Meg.

Stewie:
 I've got to get out of this house, or I'll be in worse shape than John Goodman!

Doctor:
 I've got your EKG here.

John Goodman:
 How does it look?

Doctor:
 Well... It spells out "pancakes".

John Goodman:
 Oh. Okay. So same as last time?

Doctor:
 I'm recommending you go on a strict diet immediately.

John Goodman:
 Nnnope! Horses that make it look like I can walk? Take me to Hollywood!

Brian:
 Look! There's a Family Circus dotted path. It'll lead us right to him.

Brian:
 Ah, it's just Billy. He died of measles ... and here comes Marmaduke to lick up the vomit ... lucky.

Stewie:
 If I can just escape this quarantine and make it to the next town, I'll be able to get that vaccine I need.

Future Stewie:
 Stewie! I'm you from the future! You've gotta get the hell out of town before you get sick!

Present Stewie:
 Yeah, I know. That's what I'm doing.

Future Stewie:
 Okay, I'm really here, because you have glue.

Future Stewie:
 Give me the glue!

Future Stewie:
 Stewie, listen to me. Never ever do this great thing I love.

Joe:
 So, we were all there at the Clam, just kind of making music together and then Peter, of course, had to join in and clap his hands and I said "HEY! THAT'S ENOUGH OF THAT!" Yeah, I kind of run the group.

Gatsby:
 I come down here to think every night and gaze at that green light. It's where the love of my life lives. Daisy Buchanan.

Nick:
 Um, I hate to break it to you, but that green light you've been looking at is a gay gym called the Pump House. [nervously] I ... I only know that because I ... I saw a coupon that came with my rental.

Gatsby:
 Yeah, I know right? [chuckles] Do it!

Gatsby:
 I know, I totally should, right? Here I go. One ... two .. three ... Whoa! [laughs] Can you imagine?

Daisy:
 It is. It ... it looks deep enough. It's your pool. It's your house. You can do whatever you want.

Gatsby:
 I know right? Uh, you know, I can't right now. My pool guy's cleaning it.

Daisy:
 Nick, have you met Jordan? She plays golf and is what kids will someday call a duff.

s Narration:
 In the book, I actually go on a few dates with Jordan. We're gonna skip all that.

Nick:
 Look, if you're in your own car, you're in the wrong car.

Pap:
 Hey, I'm your abusive dad and I've been drinking all day from this here jug.

Huck:
 [Notices the jug has XXX on it] Oh my God! Is that a jug full of porn? Hey, Widow Douglas, I wanna live with my dad!

Huck:
 I wish you wouldn't drink so much.

Pap:
 Stop counting my drinks! Now, get over here so I can hwip you!

Huck:
 Ow! Pap! No!

Pap:
 Yeah, that's right bitch and now it's your turn.

Huck:
 I know. I'll fake my own death. I just need enough blood to make it look real.

Pig:
 Hey there. You must be Huck. Great to finally meet you. I hope you like it here.

Huck:
 I'm gonna stab you for your blood.

Pig:
 Oh, come on. I just got shot in the pool in the last one.

Huck:
 I can't remember why I needed the blood.

Huck:
 My name's Huck Finn. What's half of your name?

Jim:
 Jim.

Huck:
 Hey, what's that sound?

Jim:
 Oh no. It sounds like a waterfall!

Huck:
 Hold on!

Jim:
 We died.

Jim:
 So, wait. We didn't die?

Huck:
 I don't know. It's all just jokes.

Huck:
 Oh, did you see that?

Jim:
 What?

Huck:
 I just skipped that rock six times! That's a once in a lifetime skip!

Jim:
 That's nice.

Huck:
 You don't believe me, do you?

Jim:
 I believe we've been out here a long time and a man's mind begins to play tricks on him.

Huck:
 It happened for real! I can't believe you didn't see it!

Jim:
 [thought] Of course I saw it. Most amazing damn thing I ever did witness, but I wasn't gonna tell Huck, cuz he claimed he didn't see me hook shot that apple core into the garbage from way far away.

Huck:
 Hey, what if it's spelled with an "A" at the end of it. Is that okay?

Huck:
 Tom Sawyer! What are you doing so far from home?

Tom:
 Rush is playing here tonight. They wrote a song about me.

Slim:
 Hey there strangers. Welcome to Phelps Ranch. People call me Slim.

George:
 Ironically, I assume.

Slim:
 Alright, you guys are doing great. Hey, listen, my dog just had puppies and I thought since you're covered with feces and I barely know you, I'll give you a delicate, snow white, newborn puppy.

Puppy:
 Okay, just don't give me to dead eyes over there because I've already been killed twice in the other two stories and I don't wanna ...

Lenny:
 Puppy!

Puppy:
 Aaaah, fuck!

Lenny:
 This puppy doesn't work.

George:
 So, I should be home by 10:00. It's just this piano bar/cabaret place called Tinkles. Rory told be about it.

Lenny:
 Who's Rory?

George:
 You remember him. The field hand who gave me a shoulder ride back to the house. That was Rory. Anyway, it sounds like it's just a hoot.

Lenny:
 Wow, maybe you'll meet a pretty lady to get married to there.

George:
 [nervously] Yeah, well, that's the idea.

Lenny:
 While you're gone, can I touch myself?

George:
 Uh, again. You don't have to schedule that with me.

s Wife:
 Well, hello there. If it isn't the sexy imbecile.

Lenny:
 Oh, hi. Sorry about what I did to your husband earlier.

s Wife:
 Yes, that was quite a hand job you did on him. You know, I'm not so bad at those, myself.

Lenny:
 I'm not gonna lie to you. You're wasting your double entendres on me.

George:
 Bye bye Lenny. [shoots Lenny] Good night, kids. Good luck with those book reports.

Brian:
 Well, there's children in the room. Watch your swearing.

Brian:
 But, can't you at least just give me a ride?

Worker:
 Goodnight, Peter.

Peter:
 Goodnight, gender transitioned co-worker, we had a whole meeting about.

Tricia:
 Peter, are you sure you heard Mr. Pewterschmidt correctly? He actually said he wanted cheap, toxic materials inserted into the Brewery supply stream?

Peter:
 Well, his eyes looked different, how he said it, but that was the gist.

Tricia:
 Mr. Griffin, it sounds like you've brought me an interesting story. What should I do with it, Ollie?

Ollie:
 MAKE IT NEWS!

Peter:
 Oh, you've got a standing desk too?

Ollie:
 SITTING'S BAD!

Peter:
 I know, they don't wanna hear it though.

Peter:
 I swear, Mama Tricia. I'm gonna make you the proudest tiger mom of all. Not like how Jesus feels about his kid.

Billy:
 Dad, I got bullied at school. They flipped up my lunch tray.

Jesus:
 Oh, that sucks. I wonder if that's the worst thing that ever happened to a guy. [takes out a Bible] Whoa. Whoa! Billy, this guy in the book here, he's really getting the business. Yikes! Okay, I'm sorry, what happened at school today?

Billy:
 You're kind of a dick, dad.

Jesus:
 Huh, I wonder if there's anyone in here, whose dad was a bigger dick. Wow, crazy!

Tricia:
 Alright, Peter. It's time to master the game of chess.

Peter:
 Okay, that shouldn't be too hard.

Tricia:
 No! You will do it in the traditional Japanese way. On a wacky game show, while a beautiful woman beats your scrotum with a reed.

Peter:
 Ow! I don't know which way the horse goes! [Peter gets hit again and a guy laughs at him] Aaah! Why is that guy laughing at me and where is he?

Peter:
 There was a time limit? Nobody told me that!

Japanese Guy:
 Time for Good Door Bad Door!

Peter:
 Wait, how bad is the bad door?

s Son:
 Grandpa-san, how bad was the bad door?

Peter:
 Not too bad, but shorty afterwards, I was almost eaten alive by an escalator.

Peter:
 The game is still going on?

Japanese Guy:
 Oh, ho, ho. You lose chess.

Stewie:
 IPDE, Brian, IPDE!

Stewie:
 IPDE! Identify, predict, decide, execute. You've got to constantly be IPDEing everything in your target zone.

Brian:
 I ... I ... I ... I don't know what you're saying.

Stewie:
 IPDE! Identify, predict, ...

Brian:
 Yeah, you said that but it doesn't mean any ...

Stewie:
 IPDE THAT!

Brian:
 Um, it's a child with a ball.

Stewie:
 Very good, identify. Now predict.

Brian:
 Predict what?

Stewie:
 IPDE!

Brian:
 You keep saying that like it's a word. Those four letters don't make a word. It's not helping me remember anything.

Stewie:
 Oh, now you've got an oncoming vehicle. Pay attention to your four to six second zone.

Brian:
 What? What is that? Four to six second?

Stewie:
 IPDE the car. IPDE the car!

Brian:
 What does that mean?

Stewie:
 Now, check your gages with one eye, while keeping your other eye on the road.

Brian:
 My eyes go in the same direction.

Stewie:
 What's your tire pressure?

Brian:
 I ... I can't ... I don't ... I'm in the car!

Stewie:
 Stop! [Brian stops the car] Demerit!

Brian:
 Stewie, I know how to drive. I've been driving for years!

Guy:
 Ever hear of IPDE, jackass!?

Peter:
 Aw, crap. This thing was a rental.

Peter:
 Here's your tux back, bye!

Peter:
 Sledding was the second passion of the Christ.

Jesus:
 Eat this, for this is my dust.

Stewie:
 [To Susie] My sled has Dora on it because my parents got it at a yard sale. It ... It's still for boys though. She's about language acquisition, not gender.

Peter:
 Now Chris, you're getting older, so it's time for you to learn the classic pool party game. Talk to someone's wife in a bikini, until they cover up uncomfortably.

Peter:
 So, Bonnie. How are things going?

Bonnie:
 Oh, things are fine. Been kind of busy lately, what with Susie starting to ... [covers up]

Peter:
 Oh, you know, this and that. There's this show called "Shipping Wars" and it's actually kind of ... [covers up]

Santa Claus:
 Now you gonna listen? Now you gonna listen, you little bitch? Who's suit are you wearing?

Peter:
 Your suit.

Chris:
 Dad, look! Santa's here! [Gestures to a Mall Santa] I wanna sit on his lap.

Peter:
 Hey Muscles, what's taking so long?

Security Guard:
 I'm sorry, sir. This may shock you, but it turns out the seasonal Santa we hired has a drinking problem. Now, I don't know where to find a replacement on such short notice. Hey, you're a hefty guy.

Peter:
 [Sadly] I called you "Muscles".

Peter:
 I once dressed as a farmer to get a date on Farmersonly.com.

s Date:
 Are you Peter?

Peter:
 Yeah, uh, are you the gross lady that lives in the converted horse trailer?

Jingle Singers:
 [Singing] You don't have to be lonely at Farmersonly.com.

Peter:
 It doesn't say "whites only", but ... yeah.

Peter:
 What the hell? Hey, Chris, get in here. This is impossible, right? All of Meg's farts, here in this box?

Chris:
 I would think that's impossible.

Peter:
 Yeah, right? That's impossible.

Quagmire:
 Is this the box?

Peter:
 Yeah, that's it.

Quagmire:
 Yeah, that's impossible.

Peter:
 I know. It's impossible. Alright, ... okay, I'm opening the gift.

Joe:
 Unless, whoever sent it was magic.

Peter:
 Oh, well then, that's interesting.

Peter:
 I wish I just stayed home and finished my remake of Inside Out.

Chris:
 I'm Joy.

Meg:
 I'm Sadness.

Stewie:
 I'm Anger.

Lois:
 I'm Disgust.

Peter:
 I'm Poo.

Riley:
 Oooh, I need to use the bathroom.

Peter:
 Yay! I win!

Peter:
 Excuse me, I'd just like to ask the mom behind me, who told me to stop watching Game of Thrones on my laptop if I'm still the worst person on this plane.

Joe:
 Get off my plane ... get off my plane.

Cleveland:
 What's that now?

Joe:
 Hm? Nothing.

Cleveland:
 Always bet on black ... always bet on black.

Joe:
 Did you say something?

Cleveland:
 I don't think so.

Both:
 Double trouble!

Cleveland:
 That's it. We found it.

Donna:
 Oh, this is all so awful!

Lois:
 What will our lives be like if our husbands don't make it?

Stewie:
 Oh my God! Now I want dad to die.

Peter:
 Look. There's one guy who slept through this whole thing.

Peter:
 Hey buddy, wake up. We're all about to die.

Guy:
 What? What are you talking about?

Peter:
 Yeah, I thought I should wake you up. Nobody wants to die in their sleep.

Guy:
 Oh my God! No! I have a family!

Peter:
 There you go.

Quagmire:
 That's a military fighter jet! He's here to shoot us down!

Peter:
 Or she.

Quagmire:
 Aw, yeah. Right there. That's good and now to discharge the plane's fire retardant.

 Joe and Quagmire:
 Giggity.

Chris:
 Dad, I was really worried, so I pulled a record of your credit card purchases in San Francisco and I saw some things I think you'd prefer to keep private.

Peter:
 We'll talk later, Chris.

Chris:
 I think we will. I do believe we will.

Peter:
 Oh, in case we didn't say, this was Spirit Airlines.

Joe:
 Hey, it's a commercial. Jerome, switch over to The Redzone.

Quagmire:
 Screw that, I say we put on the Bone Zone.

Cleveland:
 What's that?

Quagmire:
 Oh, it's awesome. They show every sex scene on TV, without all the boring dialogue and plot.

Peter:
 I didn't see that in the newsletter this month. Just a big article about how to tailgate a speeding fire truck to get places faster.

Peter:
 Wait til they get to the golf course and find out there's no fire.

Peter:
 Oh my God! Our new neighbor is Gronk!

Lou Ferrigno:
 Hey, I'm your new mailman. Former star of The Incredible Hulk, Lou Ferrigno.

Gronk:
 And my pool is filled with my favorite food: soup with little shapes in it. Sponsored by Campbell Soup.

Joe:
 Oh, alphabet soup is my favorite too!

Gronk:
 What's an "alphabet"?

Joe:
 Nothing. What you said isn't anything.

Brian:
 What the hell are we supposed to do? We're surrounded?

Joe:
 You think their wi-fi is Badgetown? Yeah, that's probably them. Look at that. No password.

Lois:
 Thank goodness we finally have our neighborhood back.

Peter:
 Yeah, now maybe Wilson can move back in and give me homespun wisdom over the fence.

Lois:
 Peter, that was Home Improvement.

Peter:
 It's exhausting, that you never just go with something I say.

Lois:
 I'm gonna go take a shower, so I can blow my nose into my hands.

Lois:
 Ow! Dammit! I hate this house.

Lois:
 [offscreen] Go to Hell!

Peter:
 That was worse than an Italian guy, describing someone's sexuality.

Italian Guy:
 Anyway, my brother Louie, he's uh...he's a little off to the side, you know? Uh, foofy. Uh, up to the knuckle. He's uh...he's a backwards mechanic, likes to play in the dirt.

Peter:
 You mean gay?

Italian Mom:
 No! [starts crying]

Italian Guy:
 Ma ma! Come on, Peter! Ma ma, Louie's not gay, he's ... he's creative.

Stewie:
 Hey what are we gonna do tonight? Ooh, maybe we should watch that movie about Freud where Michael Fassbender repeatedly spanks Keira Knightley to orgasm.

Brian:
 You saw that movie?

Stewie:
 I saw that scene.

Stewie:
 You certainly can't be any worse than the last roommate I had.

Stewie:
 What the?

Peter:
 Please don't cry, she's already very angry at me.

Lois:
 [offscreen] Peter, where are you? You will wash your hands after you poop.

Peter:
 Shh. Shh. I won't.

Joe:
 How am I doing?

Peter:
 Good job, Joe. Hole in one. [to the others] He just keeps switching clubs.

Peter:
 Hmm, still a trace of melody. I'll just add some power tools. [adds power tool sound effects] Yeah, yeah, I'd drink vodka and Gatorade to that.

Lois:
 Peter, since when are you a DJ?

Peter:
 Since some guy came in the clam and heard my awesome jams and beats.

Chris:
 Well, he's got the lingo down.

Peter:
 Thanks, Chris. NOW SCREAM!

Chris:
 AAAAAAAAAAH!

Stewie:
 Who's this turd?

Brian:
 Oh, this is Georgie.

Stewie:
 Brian, I never said you could have guests.

Georgie:
 HEY, DON'T TOUCH THAT! [quickly grabs his backpack]

Stewie:
 Okay, red flags flying.

Lois:
 Brian, there you are. I wanted to tell you, you could come back and sleep in our room?

Brian:
 What? I can?

Lois:
 Yeah, turns out it was Peter, who was causing my allergies. He stuffed all our pillows with hay because he thought it looked comfortable in cartoons.

Brian:
 Ugh, this is gonna suck. Eighty percent of these acts are either air guitar or girls dancing to songs from Frozen.

Lois:
 Well, that ... that's why the whole family came to support you.

Carter:
 Oh, really? Oh, wow. That's so kind. Who's here?

Lois:
 Oh, uh, ... well, as you know. I'm here.

Lois:
  [imitating Peter] Hey, hope those eyes get better soon, pop. It's me, Peter. Shipoopi.

Lois:
 [mimicking Chris] I'm here too, grandpa. [as herself] And, uh, and Meg went down to ... to put money in the meter.

 Hartman:
 I recommend you and your wife have someone around to help you at this time.

Lois:
 Well, I'd love to help you, Daddy, but Stewie's just been so fussy lately. He's constantly crying for no reason.

Stewie:
 What are you talking about? I'm fine.

Stewie:
 Ow! Bitch! She does this a lot!

Cleveland:
 I always liked the violin, cuz it kind of has curves like a lady.

Peter:
 I bought this jacket, like what Bugs Bunny wears when he's with that opera guy.

Cleveland:
 Wow, that looks sharp.

Peter:
 Yeah, I've been practicing how to sit down in it.

Quagmire:
 Ew, Peter. Those tails are soaking wet.

Peter:
 They may have been in the toilet.

Joe:
 I haven't seen him this upset, since he got caught using that fake ID.

Check Out Guy:
 Can I see your ID, please?

Check Out Guy:
 Give me one second. [gets on the phone] Uh, sir? That lady who came in and ate all the pies is back.

 Hartman:
 See if you can tell me where Waldo is.

Carter:
 He's right there, buying an ice cream cone.

 Hartman:
 Dammit. I've been stuck on that page for two days.

Brian:
 I guess I got used to being a little pampered at Carter's.

Stewie:
 Well, I'd be careful with your uptown ways. Some of the other kids don't like it.

Chris:
 He thinks he's better than us.

Meg:
 What time are you going to bed, fancy boy?

Brian:
 I don't know, 9:00.

Meg:
 9:00, Chris.

Stewie:
 Brian, you're not kidding anyone. We all know you don't care about Carter. You only care about his money.

Brian:
 No, no, no. He knows I'm his friend.

Stewie:
 Yeah, right. That's what Woody thought about Buzz Lightyear.

Woody:
 Bo Peep! Wha...what's going on here?

Bo Peep:
 Uhhh...you've got a friend in me?

Peter:
 I'll be ready, unlike Lois, getting dressed for a night out.

Lois:
 Tell them the truth.

Peter:
 It's me! It's me! I'm the one who takes too long to get ready. It's cuz I don't have any nice clothes.

Peter:
 Alright, it's cuz I don't like the way I look!

Tom:
 Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker. Coming up, tonight's second story.

Stewie:
 No, this time it's not a bit. I'm really hurt. I must have jacked it up, playing sports and not trying to dance like Beyonc .

Al Harrington:
 Good afternoon and welcome to today's auction. I'm Al Harrington of Al Harrington's Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm-Flailing Tubeman Warehouse and Emporium. Due to the presence of black mold, discarded half-eaten turkey legs, and an undulating rat king that no one dares approach, I have been advised to move these proceedings along as quickly as possible.

Al Harrington:
 Do I hear higher than twenty five cents?

Peter:
 This paper bag, which could be full of money or my socks. You take the chance.

Al Harrington:
 We have an intriguing mystery bag. Do I hear more than the mystery bag?

Adam West:
 Two bets and a cardboard box, which may or may not contain a mystery bag.

Al Harrington:
 Do I hear a much higher bid, followed by shocked murmuring?

Adam West:
 Ten thousand dollars!

Joe:
 We can't afford that!

Quagmire:
 Peter, do something!

Peter:
 I can't! There's only nine thousand dollars in the mystery bag!

Peter:
 Archers!

Carl:
 Yeah?

Peter:
 Oh, yeah, he's that guy too.

 Hartman:
 He just needs to wear this brace for a while, to correct him.

Lois:
 Oh, dear.

 Hartman:
 Now, does he have any school pictures coming up?

Lois:
 Yeah, he actually does.

 Hartman:
 Well, then this will not be a refrigerator door year.

 Hartman:
 Wow, that patient, next door is fat!

Patient:
 [offscreen] I can hear you!

 Hartman:
 Uh, that wasn't me, that was Mrs. Griffin.

Peter:
 Oh, for God sake.

Joe:
 You're gonna have a baby in your butt, man.

Quagmire:
 Can't leave. Heather, within 5 miles is coming.

Heather:
 Are you Glenn, within 5 miles? I can take my glass eye out if you wanna try something different.

Cleveland:
 I got a good feeling about her. Maybe she's the one.

Stewie:
 Watch me jump this line. [nudges his way through the line] Scuse me, I have scoliosis. Scuse me, scoliosis coming though.

Guy with polio:
 Hey pal, polio.

Peter:
 Guys, I've been to the doctor's. I do have a baby in my butt.

Stewie:
 You've got to take me to the hospital!

Brian:
 Absolutely. Let me just watch Jennifer's Body and we'll go right there.

Stewie:
 Brian, there's no nudity in that movie. Take me to the hospital!

Brian:
 What, so it's rated R for curses? God, this country.

Stewie:
 Is it- Is it noticeable?

Brian:
 Eh, nothing that can't be fixed with a string of chili pepper Christmas lights.

Stewie:
 [narrating] I wore that brace for the next five years of my life. The kids stopped cheering the second day. Then it was just "Get off the swing, you Christmas turd!"

Joe:
 It may not sound exciting, but I play an important role. I go through all the body cam footage and take out all the parts where the cops go pee pee.

Cleveland:
 So, you're just erasing cop weiners all day?

Chris:
 Mom, can I go bare hand raisins from the bulk aisle?

Lois:
 Okay, but if you get caught, just say "Oopsy poopsy" like a simpleton.

Chris:
 Is that a Michael Sam jersey?

Stewie:
 Yep, two boy names. Doubly masculine.

Brian:
 Like George Michael?

Brian:
 Come on, Stewie. Are you still hung up about that woman at the grocery store, thinking you were a girl?

Chris:
 Elton John...is another.

Stewie:
 It has nothing to do with that, Brian. I just thought it'd be good to take up a sport. You know, like boys do.

Brian:
 You don't have to play football to prove you're a boy.

Chris:
 Barney Frank ... is yet another one.

Brian:
 Chris, please. Actually, you know what? Ricky Martin. There's a bunch of these.

Joe:
 I'm just like any other cop, my wife puts on my pants, one leg at a time.

Chris:
 Wow, so these are the wife-beaters of tomorrow.

Brian:
 Excuse me, Coach Herar ... Herar ... Herara ... Rararara?

Coach Herrera:
 It's Herrera.

Brian:
 Okay, that's a lot of Rs, but listen. I ... I noticed you're not starting Stewie.

Coach Herrera:
 Oh, I can't put him in. I mean, he can come out for limp handshakes at the end of the game, but I can't play him. He's too little.

Brian:
 Little? Oh, like that car you drive over there? Let's see if it looks bigger, when I throw a Sprite at it.

Coach Herrera:
 Well, it's not my car, but I don't care, I'm just a volunteer.

Peter:
 I want a minute in your house with this shopping cart, like Supermarket Sweep. Here, time me.

Joe:
 Peter, you expect me to let you ransack my house?

Peter:
 Well, unless you'd rather I spill the beans to the chief about who's been doing your dirty work.

Joe:
 Okay, go.

Peter:
 [offscreen] Aw, sweet, board games! I'm taking the cannon from your Monopoly.

Bonnie:
 [offscreen] Aaaah! Why is Peter in the house?

Joe:
 It's a police matter, Bonnie!

Peter:
 [offscreen] Hey, how come Kevin's room is locked?

Joe:
 He just wants some privacy!

Peter:
 [offscreen] It's locked from the outside!

Joe:
 Don't open it, Peter!

Peter:
 [offscreen] Hi baby! Hi baby!

Joe:
 Get out of Susie's room!

Peter:
 Your stuff sucks. I didn't need the full minute.

Stewie:
 Is anybody gonna answer that telephone?

Chris:
 He keeps thinking the phone is ringing, Brian.

Brian:
 Well, at least he's talking again. I think that means he's getting better.

Stewie:
 Is it day or night? I don't ... I don't care. I just wanna know. LOIS, ANSWER THE BLOODY PHONE!

Brian:
 No, no, no! We don't need Lois. [chuckles] Chris, pretend to answer the phone.

Chris:
 Uh ... uh, hello? Okay, yes, one second. MOM, IT'S FOR YOU!

Brian:
 What? No, damn it, Chris! Um, um, ... I'll take that. Hello, this is Brian Griffin. Actually, I already received The New York Times and I always enjoy finishing the crossword puzzle.

Chris:
 You're bragging to nobody?

Bonnie:
 Joe, is something wrong? I didn't hear you crying in the shower this morning.

Brian:
 Chris, what the hell?

Chris:
 There is a room, where you can go in and just get free people.

Woman:
 Excuse me, do you have any Tab soda I can bring back to the sex dungeon where I've been held captive for decades?

Joe:
 Ma'am, this is a crime scene. I'm gonna have to ask you to move along.

Joe:
 You're right, Peter.  I"m a pretty good cop.

Peter:
 Aw, yeah, peanut butter cup, Dorito, sausage, car panini, and let s crack a Cadbury Egg over the whole thing. Just gonna use my spare glove-compartment-underwear as a napkin. I can t believe Randy Quaid gets to eat like this every day.

 Hartman:
 [To Meg and Chris] Hey, did that big 'boomba boomba' nurse come in here?

Peter:
 Oh, hey Lois. I guess you must be happy.

Lois:
 Yeah, it's every girl's dream to have her husband hoisted out of a food truck in a horse harness.

Lois:
 Oh, look what came! The free DVD from my PBS pledge.

Peter:
 Whatever it is, we're not watching it.

Lois:
 Peter, trust me. You, of all people, could really learn something from this. It's a documentary about the food industry called Food Kills.

Brian:
 Huh, says here that Colon Health Magazine gave it two thumbs in.

Roller Derby Coach:
 How would you like to try out for the roller derby team?

Ruth:
 Do it, Meg.

Patty:
 Yeah, Meg. You should totally do it.

Esther:
 Meg's talking to a boy!

Meg:
 Okay, sure. What the heck?

Roller Derby Coach:
 Here, take my card.

Meg:
 I am a registered sex offender.

Roller Derby Coach:
 Flip of over.

Meg:
 Important: see other side.

Roller Derby Coach:
 Give me that.

Lois:
 It's the middle of the night. Where are you going?

Peter:
 I'm sick of all this healthy crap. I'm going downstairs to find something good to eat and then I'm gonna fall asleep, watching transvaginal mesh lawsuit commercials.

Chris:
 There's nothing.

Peter:
 Thank you, son.

Carl:
 [noticing Peter has purchased a lot of food] What's going on, man, are you pregnant?

Peter:
 No, my wife watched that food documentary. And you should never ask that unless you're sure, by the way.

Cleveland:
 Is this because of Food Kills?

Peter:
 I saw that movie, too, huh?

Cleveland:
 We watched Tyler Perry's food kills, which is the same movie, except it stars black folks, you've never heard of and white folks, you never hear from anymore. But, yeah, now Donna is forcing me to eat healthy.

Peter:
 I always get confused. Is Donna the wife or is Roberta the wife?

Cleveland:
 I don't know, man. Can I have some of that sandwich?

Lois:
 I can't believe you'd buy a food truck. What are you even selling?

Peter:
 First of all, believe it, baby. Second, uh, mostly hamburgers, where the buns is jelly donuts and drinks where hot dogs is the straws.

Bruce:
 Mmmm. Another milkshake please.

Neil:
 My favorite part of a woman's body is haunches and this is all haunch, baby.

Peter:
 That'll be sixteen dollars.

Guy:
 Sixteen dollars? That's expensive.

Peter:
 Yes sir, everything's very expensive because you're paying for it on an iPad. Now, if you'll just select a gratuity, options are sixty percent, ninety percent, and two hundred percent.

Guy:
 Uh, I guess sixty percent.

Peter:
 Okay, great, and just sign by dragging your bare finger across this thing I use to masturbate.

Guy:
 Uh, okay.

Peter:
 Thank you. Please make sure to bang your head on that low hanging thing.

Guy:
 What are you [bangs his head on the awning] Aaah!

Peter:
 Up, you spilled something. You want a napkin?

Guy:
 Yes, please.

Peter:
 Alright, here's forty blown by the wind.

Meg:
 I love roller derby. It's the first thing I'm really good at. Plus, I love making other women bleed...but you know in ways...besides the way...you know, they normally bleed.

Stewie:
 [offscreen] She means periods!

Chris:
 Yeah, I got it, Stewie.

Tom:
 So, tonight, we say, to the yellow billed marsh finch, you're extinct!

Tricia:
 Mr. Griffin, is this a performance art or uh, some sort of a political statement?

Peter:
 Well, I'm kind of ticked about condoms in porn, but this is unrelated.

Peter:
 Looking better doesn't always solve your problems, Lois. Sure didn't work for Droopy Dog when he got that face lift.

Droopy:
 [Smiling widely] Contrary to my appearance, I'm still not happy. [Holds gun to chest] Please study my brain so that others don't suffer as I have.

Meg:
 Mom, you're really going to Boston? I didn't even think you liked baseball.

Lois:
 Oh, I'm not going for baseball. I'm going for shopping, the hotel spa, and two days of away from you life sucking turds.

Meg:
 Okay, now you heard mom say I'm in charge. So, I just wanna lay a few ground rules.

Meg:
 Because, it's actually more fun, when everyone pitches in.

Stewie:
 Rupert, what do you think of this fanfiction I wrote? [reads from the fanfiction] Diego pressed Dora against the wall. Her bosom heaving. Her hot Latina breath on his face. For once, Diego was going to do the exploring. [fans himself] Phew, just reading it. Muy caliente.

Coach:
 It's always the fat one.

Peter:
 I heard that.

Coach:
 I said it right to you. You know what? Let's just get Lois up to bat. Where's Lois?

Lois:
 I'm right here, coach. Guess you don't have a lot of babes out here, except for Babe Ruth. Ha ha ha ha ha!

Brian:
 Stewie, what the hell's going on?

Stewie:
 Meg's awful! She gave me a time out and she's making me sit in this chair!

Brian:
 My God, she put eyeshadow on you too.

Stewie:
 I might have gotten up from the chair. Brian, Meg's lost her mind. You've gotta talk to her!

Brian:
 Stewie, Lois put Meg in charge and...honestly, one I knew that...I ate a pot cookie, so um...yeah...so good luck with all that...uh...you got any cool DVDs?

Stewie:
 Brian, please! I need help!

Brian:
 Hah! Totally. Hey, where's Chris? I wonder if he'll play Wii Bowling with me?

Brian:
 The trick, Chris, is thinking of the wand as an extension of your arm.

Chris:
 Wow, I can't believe I'm pretend bowling with a dog on drugs!

Coach:
 Come on, Lois. We've got you sitting right next to Pedro Mart nez and Ted Williams' severed head.

Ted Williams:
 There's a special place in Hell for whoever's responsible for me ending up like this.

Coach:
 Who wants to play second?

Peter:
 I will!

Coach:
 Lois, why don't you take second?

Peter:
 How could he not see that? I even held up my arm with my other hand.

Baseball Player:
 That is the most noticeable way to raise your hand.

Peter:
 You think I'll be back in time for the game?

Coach:
 What? You're not playing in the game. It's supposed to be a fun day out here and you go nuts and break your wife's leg!

Peter:
 It's not my fault. I'm all hopped up on hard baseball card gum. [Peter crunches baseball card gum] Mmmm. It's like eating a Mastercard.

Lois:
 You know what I'm getting sick of saying? My husband did this to me, but it's not what you think.

Meg:
 Hello? Oh, hi mom.

Lois:
 Hi, honey. How you doing? How's Stewie?

Meg:
 Oh, he's great. Not lost or anything. How's fantasy camp going?

Lois:
 Uh, your father broke my leg out of jealousy, but that didn't ruin our honeymoon and it's not gonna ruin this. So listen, I want all you guys to drive up to Boston this afternoon, to see your father play in the big game.

Meg:
 Uh, wow, we'd love to, mom, but we promised Stewie, we'd perform a puppet show for him, later today.

Lois:
 Oh, you could perform it for all of us, up here in Boston. The game's in two hours. Drive safely.

Meg:
 Crap. Now we've gotta find Stewie and write a puppet show.

Brian:
 We could repurpose my one act farce.

Brian:
 Hey, just because it's already been written, doesn't mean it's not fresh.

Meg:
 What did I just say? Shut up! We're in trouble! I'm in trouble.

Stewie:
 Hey, what's this? A dickweed convention?

Chris:
 Stewie!

Meg:
 Oh, thank God, you're home!

Brian:
 Where the hell have you been?

Stewie:
 As far away from her as possible! I forgot her name, honestly.

Lois:
 Fair ball! Run, Peter! Run it out!

Brain Guy:
 Peter's brain.

Muscle Guy:
 Yeah, uh. This is the muscle department. What the hell is he doing?

Brain Guy:
 Uh, apparently, he's trying to sprint.

Muscle Guy:
 Sprint? He got winded, walking to the plate and he's been out in the blazing sun for two days! Has he had any water?

Brain Guy:
 No, he told his wife, there's juices in the hot dogs.

Muscle Guy:
 Well, I'm sorry, I've got no choice, but to call for a complete muscle failure.

Chris:
 Look! Dad's planking, from like eight years ago!

Stewie:
 Is there a Neiman Marcus is Boston?

Lois:
 Peter! Get up! Get up and run!

Brian:
 Run, Peter!

Chris:
 Come on, dad!

Meg:
 We love you!

Stewie:
 Copley Place. How far is that?

Principal Shepherd:
 [over the intercom] Good morning students. Today at 3:30, James Woods High will be hosting a cross-country meet, which also happens to be where Lorraine has threatened to take my children. Across the country. And here's today's Tuesday trivia question. Does this sound like yelling? Because apparently, this sounds to some people like yelling.

Meg:
 Oh, thank God.

Meg:
 Very funny. Who put the ark of the covenant in here?

Stewie:
 Please rub the H and the C off all the knobs, so people won't know what the hell's going on. I want the first 4 minutes of every shower to be confusion and anger.

Peter:
 Lois, I'm done with my gum.

Lois:
 I don't want it.

Peter:
 But I'm done with it!

Lois:
 Peter, shhh!

Guy:
 I'll take it.

Chris:
 Mom, why was this listerine in the garbage?

Lois:
 Oh, your father says he doesn't need it anymore, now that he's a high school principal.

Peter:
 Hello, Breakfast Club. [chuckles] As a principal, I like to start each morning with a reference from last century.

Lois:
 I feel you, Meg.

Meg:
 Shut up!

Lois:
 You shut up!

Peter:
 Hey guys, guys. When Borat was making announcements over the PA this morning, that was me.

Chris:
 What? Shut the front door!

Peter:
 [mimicking Borat] Taco Tuesday, it's nice?

Stewie:
 Hey, Brian? What's a splat job?

Brian:
 I ... I don't ... I don't know, Stewie. I'm worried that you're seeing too much.

Stewie:
 Alright, shows over. Everybody back to work.

Hooker:
 Yeah, about that. We gotta talk.

Brian:
 Oh, uh, sure. What's up?

Hooker:
 We just realized, we can keep all the money, take your house, and kill you if you try to do anything about it.

Stewie:
 Alright, we're just gonna step outside and figure out a counter.

Stewie:
 And they locked us out.

School Board Guy:
 Mr. Griffin, you are hereby relieved of your duties.

Peter:
 [gasp] A promotion?

Peter:
 I'm planning on dying tonight. [punches himself in the nose, making it break and bleed] What are your plans?

Chris:
 I saw Lady and the Tramp, so I asked if we could eat spaghetti in the alley, but they said no cuz of all the homeless masturbation.

Lois:
 Are you sure you wanna date a girl who's ... had so much experience?

Lois:
 Like, maybe she's got some city miles on her vuvu.

Brian:
 Look, I can see why you're concerned that Chris' girlfriend has kids, but, he's happy and she seems like she's into him. Plus she's ... [bites lip] she's hot.

Lois:
 [biting her lip] Yeah, she is.

Herbert:
 [offscreen] It's not me. I'm in your closet.

Guy:
 Maybe we should improve out business model.

Consuela:
 No ... no.

Girl:
 Improve out original content?

Guy:
 So, we have no corporate identity?

Consuela:
 We secondary Email, people use to sign up for porn sites.

Meg:
 Uh, dad, you're reading the paper upside down.

Peter:
 Wrong again, idiot.

Lois:
 What makes you think you can take care of two babies?

Chris:
 I don't know. I've seen her take care of them. I've seen you with Stewie. Frankly, it doesn't seem that hard.

Stewie:
 You just shattered her world ... shattered!

Chris:
 If you'll excuse me, these two need to eat.

Stewie:
 He bought a breast feeding book. Someone may wanna pop in on him.

Peter:
 I mean, I made pretty good money when I hosted that confusing game show.

Peter:
 Alright, Phil, come stand by me. It's Ashley's turn. Ashley, go ahead. Pick an answer, find a question, spin the table and remember, the clock is ticking backwards.

Ashley:
 I'll pass?

Peter:
 Congrats! You win. Sorry to see you go, and Phil, we'll see you tomorrow. That's all the time we have. For those of you playing at home, Why and How? Audience?

Audience:
 Why and How!

Peter:
 Stop that!

Isabella:
 Chris! What in the mind of Mencia are you doing here?

Quagmire:
 Hey, you must be Isabella. I came as soon as I heard about you and then I got on my plane. Huh, huh. Alright.

Chris:
 Boy, I can't believe there'd be corrupt cops in Mexico.

Peter:
 Donald Trump was right ... his daughter is a hot piece of ass.

Consuela:
 Time for clean getaway.

Peter:
 Hey, Lois?

Peter:
 How would you find the name of the actual actress who plays the AT&T chick?

Lois:
 I left a list of hot commercial girls on the refrigerator.

Peter:
 What is this refrigerator you keep mentioning? Are you talking about the sandwich house?

Cleveland:
 [crying on the toilet] I used to have my own show.

Bonnie:
 [fake voice] Hello, is this Joe Swanson?

Lois:
 Wait, you can talk normal?

Bonnie:
 [normal voice] What do you mean?

Lois:
 Nevermind.

Peter:
 Hello, don't say anything about the 1998 Oscars. I'm watching it now.

Donna:
 Sometimes friends put wine out for each other.

Peter:
 Alright, I'll see you later.

Lois:
 What? Where are you going?

Peter:
 Laser tag orientation.

Bonnie:
 Well, that's obviously not true.

Donna:
 Yeah, that boy got liar-hea.

Lois:
 Oh my God. I gotta follow him. Find out where he's really going.

Donna:
 Good idea. If I was you, I'd stick to him like glue-arrhea.

Lois:
 Okay, I think I'm starting to crack your code.

Peter:
 Last night, I get this call from a woman, who says she's my daughter.

Lois:
 Peter, that was me. I was prank calling you.

Peter:
 You what!? I can't believe you would do that to me!

s Sperm Donation Offspring:
 Hi dad!

Katie:
 We're all your children. We came from your semen. Semen. [chortles]

Live Studio Ostrich:
 Ha ha! Oh, sorry. Wrong house.

Ostrich:
 Look, Eddie's at the wrong house. Ha ha!

Peter:
 I've never felt proud of any of my children until now.

German Offspring:
 This is so exciting. For years, I have dreamed of one day travelling from Bavaria to play the accordion for my birth family. May I? [plays accordion]

Stewie:
 I have just one question for you. [points to shoes] WHAT ARE THOSE!?

German Offspring:
 Oooh, I get that, because this comedy has just made it to Germany.

Larry:
 Sorry I drew so many Nazi symbols on the place mat. I was just nervous.

Lois:
 That's okay. I just wish we hadn't gone to a Kosher restaurant.

Stewie:
 That big one doesn't blink a lot, does he?

Peter:
 By the way, thanks, all my kids, for stepping in to help. Really, really appreciate that.

Lois:
 At our age, all I'm really looking for in a husband is someone who wants to watch TV with me on a Saturday night and isn't afraid to pop a zit on my back.

Peter:
 Afraid? I love doing that! It's like bubble wrap you get to have sex with every now and then.

Narrator:
 From that day forward, Peter and Lois never again...oop, nope, sorry. There's still another scene left.

Peter:
 From now on, I'm making sure my sperm stays right where it belongs: in the bathroom sink.

Rat Hybrid:
 We have fun down here.

Lois:
 Well, I'm not making another episode with The Simpsons. What did that get us? I'll tell you what it got us. More ink for The Simpsons.

Peter:
 Yeah. [reads newspapers] Simpsons plays down to competition, Simpsons step into the sewer, Shame on you, Simpsons. [jealous] Those lucky bastards.

Lois:
 [warning Peter as he shuts the door] Forget the freakin' Emmy. If you touch her ass I'm...

Stewie:
 And on Karaoke night, I identify as George Micheal. That doesn't mean it's true.

Tricia:
 Daddies, I'm standing here, delivering my line with more emotion and less of a monotone than the actual Lily on Modern Family.

Meg:
 Thanks to you, I now believe in me. Me. M E. I believe in Emmy!

For your Emmy consideration:
 Meg Griffin" tag shows up on screen]

Peter:
 [Wipes the tag offscreen] Okay, okay, alright, don't want one that bad.

 Hartman:
 Peter, I'd like to introduce the surgeon who will perform your procedure today. [holds up a scalpel] Dr. Wang Gone.

Peter:
 We'll sneak into the drama category. That's how we'll win the Emmy. With dark, confusing plot twists, like on Homeland or Mad Men.

Chris:
 Ooh, or Breaking Bad or Mr. Robot Chicken!

Peter:
 No, Chris. It's "Mr. Robot".

Peter:
 Mr. Robot.

Peter:
 No, no. Chris, you see, Mr. Robot is a critically acclaimed show. Robot Chicken is something kids used to watch in 2006. It's basically 4 minutes of nonsense, on at 1:00 in the morning, breaking up personal injury ads.

Lois:
 How are we ever gonna pay all these bills, that have been perfectly ripped across the top, so the words "past due" are visible?

Cleveland:
 Yo, you five-o?

Adam West:
 No, I'm 87. How flattering.

Joe:
 I need the money to pay off my mysterious boss, Mr. Robot.

Chris:
 [offscreen] Chicken!

Peter:
 Bill Maher? What are you doing, not smoking outside of church?

Bill Maher:
 Uh, yeah, I was just doing that. Uh, look, Peter, I'm here for two reasons. First, to find out who that Asian girl was on the couch, and second, to tell you that Family Guy will never, ever win an Emmy.

Peter:
 Okay, first of all, that was Asa Akira. I think you knew that. Second, are you saying there's a conspiracy against us?

Shonda Rhimes:
 The racial stuff on your show is just embarrassing. You have people of color, voiced by white actors.

Consuela:
 [shocked] No!

Shonda Rhimes:
 Yes! Hell, I'm Shonda Rhimes and I'm being voiced by a white actor.

Peter:
 You know, I may not get Emmys, but I do get the best award of all. My family and this E-mail from a young fan. [reads E-mail] Dear, sir. Your show helped me when I was going through chemotherapy.

Lois:
 [sadly] Awwww.

Peter:
 My favorite episode was when Homer stays home from church, aw dammit, he thinks we're The Simpsons.

Ty Burrell:
 I don't have any more room in my house.

Peter:
 Huh, samurai or geishas ... Which one am I? I'll just wait 'til somebody else goes in.

Peter:
 Well, that wasn't helpful.

Stewie:
 You know later we're going to have to take one of those forced happiness family photos that come in the restaurant's tacky frame.

Chris:
 Why are you so fucking negative all the time?

Anthropologie Store Owner:
 Sir, sir, there's nothing you can possibly imagine, that's strange or useless enough, that we don't have it here at Anthropologie.

Peter:
 Oh, my God. Are ... Are you the coolest guy ever?

George Clooney:
 Hi, George Clooney, second worst Batman.

Peter:
 Peter Griffin, second best Homer.

Peter:
 Ugh, it's the guys. What do those losers want?

Lois:
 Losers? Those are your friends.

Peter:
 Nah, they're lame. Not one of them has ever vaped at a funeral.

Peter:
 Julia Louis Dreyfus has a lot of Emmys now.

Jerry Seinfeld:
 Yeah.

Peter:
 Why did your wife steal that cook book?

Quagmire:
 Why are you wearing a douche suit?

Peter:
 They also make wipes!

Joe:
 They're not known for their wipes.

Cleveland:
 Peter, you don't have to jump off a cliff to prove you're sorry.

Quagmire:
 Not all of us believe that, but we took a vote and I agreed. I respect the majority.

Peter:
 Aaaah! Nickels!

Peter:
 FYI, my mom's not picking me up for a long time, because ...

Peter:
 She's dead!

Natalia:
 Next book, Everybody Poops ... Blood.

Peter:
 Give me two of those round balls of butter and a bread stick. You'll see where I'm heading with this. Okay, look, look, look. [makes a phallic shape with the food] Here's what you want. [Bites the bread stick in half] Here's what you got.

Lois:
 Donna, have you seen this Black-ish?

Donna:
 Why you asking me that?

Lois:
 I don't know, it seems like you might like it.

Lois:
 Oh, and waiter. Have you seen this Fresh off the Boat?

Waiter:
 Why are you asking me that?

Lois:
 I don't know, it seems like you might like it. [notices Mort offscreen] Oh, there's Mort. Mort! Have you seen this, The Goldbergs?

Mort:
 [offscreen] Yes, I like it, cuz I'm Jewish.

Peter:
 I love how you share things that were told to you in confidence.

Peter:
 Hello? ... I see.

Lois:
 What is it?

Peter:
 I've been assassinated.

Lois:
 Wow, what a night. I guess someone's sleep number is 69.

Peter:
 Uh, yes, it was apparently also number 2.

Peter:
 This is Family Guy. We only do the male side of the joke.

Cleveland:
 I have dibs on whatever silliness Peter loses interest in. [Cleveland puts on a hat] Remember this? To the Clevelandcopter! [Cleveland flies a helicopter, designed to look like him] The mustache obscures my view!

Peter:
 Hey, look. Cookies.

Lois:
 Chocolate chip?

Peter:
 Oatmeal raisin.

Lois:
 FUCK!

Peter:
 Oh, here's another note. [reads note] How adorable were those first two notes? I hope you read this one third.

Peter:
 Can you notice that?

Peter:
 Can you notice anything in the world, other than that?

Natalia:
 No kissing! Under the bed!

Natalia:
 Out!

Cleveland:
 Boy, that was a close one. Up, my son was in the back seat.

Natalia:
 You going home. Count to three and pull cord.

Stewie:
 Aaaaaah! I don't know my numbers!

Carter:
 You there, mailman!

Carter:
 No, the other black guy in shorts. Yes you!

Tom:
 What do we have, ... up, too young.

Nicole:
 So this is stuck at work?

Ernie:
 Honey, please. Lois is a friend.

Lois:
 Really. Nicole, you've got the wrong idea.

Nicole:
 How does this bitch know my name?

Lois:
 Bitch? Ok, 'ho.

Nicole:
 Oh, I'm going to enjoy this.

Ernie:
 Come on, now ladies...

Jesus:
 Awesome. A chick-chicken chick fight.

RJ:
 Since you are my girlfriend and are hot, will you marry me, so that I can bone you?

Janine:
 As long as you can always throws a NERF football over my truck with your strong arm.

RJ:
 You mean this arm?

RJ:
 Aw, cripes!

Janine:
 Yeah, now there is no way.

Ollie Williams:
 [To Tomik and Bellgarde who are driving recklessly] You gon' crash!

Meg:
 How long has that bike been out front?

Carl:
 I don't know, a couple hours?

Meg:
 I'm gunna swipe that puppy.

Neil Goldman:
 [To a park bench dedicated to the memory of his mother, Muriel Goldman] Look who's still standing, bitch. [Tosses money on the bench] Go buy yourself something nice in Hell.

Bonnie:
 Joe! I found a dollar!

Joe:
 That's great, Bonnie! Let's go to dinner we can talk all about it.

Bonnie:
 What's there to talk about? I looked down on the ground and there was a dollar.

Joe:
 Bonnie, save it for the dinner table!

Seamus:
 I thought the show was really great.

Ida:
 Thank you, I couldn't help but notice you talked throughout it.

Peter:
 I don't want you talking to him anymore.

Peter:
 Whose fault is this?

Lois:
 You're wearing a garbage bag as a cape. Who do you think?

Brian:
 So, who are you reading?

Girl:
 George Elliot.

Brian:
 Ah, Georgie. I'm a big fan. I think he...

Girl:
 She.

Brian:
 She said it best, when she said. [looks at a page of the girl's book] "Bantam Press, 1851".

Peter:
 Um, what's the name of this place?

s Employee:
 Dick's.

Peter:
 [snickers] A...And what's that say on your shirt?

Peter:
 [snickers] Can I have two balls...and a helmet?

s Employee:
 Hey, you're the guy from the phone!

Peter:
 [offscreen] Start the car, Chris!

Chris:
 [offscreen] Did you get him, dad?

Peter:
 [offscreen] We got him!

Brian:
 About to see the new Kevin Hart movie. Just kidding. I'm white & went to college. #BaywatchMovie

Peter:
 Hey, Jerome. Gimme a beer.

Jerome:
 Oh, why? Cuz I'm like your slave? Man, you're no better than your racist dog.

Peter:
 Come on, man. Brian was just making a joke.

Quagmire:
 I told you about Brian, man. I told you.

Sensitive Guy:
 Your dog wrote an insensitive tweet. You can't eat here.

Chris:
 Uh-oh, Meg. It's a sensitivity mob.

Meg:
 It was just a joke!

Sensitive Girl:
 There's no such thing as jokes anymore.

Other Sensitive Guy:
 Yeah, we live in a post-joke world.

Lois:
 This is getting out of control. We can't leave the house without getting harassed.

Peter:
 Yeah, yesterday I went outside to try to get the mail and I had a seizure.

Brian:
 Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here today to apologize...

Brian:
 It's just ... It's just a standard greeting. Let...let me start over. Gentlemen and ladies...

Brian:
 Okay, sorry I...I, um. Humans in the audience.

Brian:
 What do you all want from me? Huh? Do you wanna ruin my life? Then, congratulations! You did it! Everybody hates me! I can't leave the house without getting harassed, no one will hire me...

Stewie:
 [offscreen] That was a problem, before.

Stewie:
 This collar is ours. It has our address on it.

Stewie:
 Peace, dude.

Store Clerk:
 Hey, did you knock over a few bottles in Aisle 7?

Brian:
 Um, yeah.

Store Clerk:
 [sigh]

Brian:
 ... Okay.

Peter:
 So what do you do for fun around here? You got DirectTV?

Putin:
 We have Time-Warner.

Peter:
 You have HBO?

Peter:
 You have ESPN?

Putin:
 We have FOX Sports 1.

Peter:
 That come in HD?

Putin:
 420D.

Peter:
 You got --

Putin:
 Everything you say, I say something little bit worse.

Peter:
 Ah. I did it to myself.

Peter:
 Russia has all the hottest and ugliest women in the world. All 10's and 1's.

Peter:
 How do you say friend in Russian?

Putin:
 There is no Russian word for it.

Putin:
 Where is bathroom? I George Brett myself on plane.

Peter:
 Eww. Gross.

Brian:
 Hey, listen, you...you don't think...You don't think you could snag a couple of rolls of toilet paper, could you?

Brian:
 Stewie?

Stewie:
 My, that was close.

Brian:
 Stewie, he saw you! He saw you leaving his apartment!

Stewie:
 Oh. Well, so what? He doesn't know what we're doing.

Brian:
 [gasp]

Stewie:
 What? What is it?

Stewie:
 Well, that's...that's not good.

Lois:
 [Enters Brian's shared hospital room] Oh my God Brian, are you okay?

Lois:
 She's was hit by...uh, she was struck by a smooth criminal.

Chris:
 That was fun, mom. We don't get to do a lot of that kind of stuff together.

Lois:
 And, Meg, I hope you learned your lesson about drinking.

Meg:
 Thanks, mom.

Lois:
 You know, Chris. You and your stillborn brother, Tmas were named after Christmas.

Peter:
 Aw, now I wanna be on that side.

Peter:
 Well, that didn't work. Now to take a sliding toilet seat soaking wet dump.

Patrick Swayze:
 Peter, you're in trouble. So, I've come back to help you recapture the true spirit of Christmas.

Peter:
 [gasp] Ghost House

Patrick Swayze:
 Road House.

Peter:
 Ghost Road.

Patrick Swayze:
 House House.

Peter:
 Road Ghost.

Peter:
 Oh, wow! This is my old house from when I was a little kid.

Patrick Swayze:
 That's right, Peter. I'm taking you all the way back to the year 1970/80/90.

Peter:
 I'll never forget that year. When President Richard Reagan Clinton lied to the American people.

Ollie:
 CHRISTMAS!

s Son:
 WHAT'S THIS!?

Ollie:
 COAL!

s Son:
 WHY!?

Ollie:
 BAD!

s Son:
 AWWW!

Carter:
 Wie geht es dir?

Nana Pewterschmidt:
 Es gibt zu viele Juden in Brasilien.

Chris:
 What did she say?

Carter:
 She wishes you a Merry Christmas.

Stewie:
 That's not what she said.

Meg:
 We should probably call Durd.

Chris:
 You mean dad?

Meg:
 No, the fat guy who sleeps with mom.

Stewie:
 You guys talkin' 'bout Durd?

Peter:
 Who's that guy?

Patrick Swayze:
 That's Lois' new husband, Lance.

Peter:
 Wow. I finally had the guts to leave her. Good for you, Peter.

Peter:
 All the porn girls I follow in Instagram have Santa hats on. It must be Christmas!

Peter:
 For Brian, a Rhode Island sweatshirt with both "Rhode" and "Island" misspelled.

Brian:
 Wow, it hurts when I put it on!

Scott:
 We'll get to the specials, but first, I need to tell you... I'm gay.

Peter:
 The hell you are! No waiter of mine is gonna be gay!

Lois:
 Peter, please. He's our waiter. He's the only waiter we have.

Peter:
 Lois, our waiter is dead to us. We have to focus all our attention on our hostess now.

Lois:
 He-he just needs a little time.

Peter:
 Scott... I'm finally ready to hear the specials.

Brian:
 Where's Stewie.

Stewie:
 He ate me!

Peter:
 I ate him.

Billy Joel:
 He ate Stewie, Holy crap! Family Guy will be right back!

Meg:
 What are you doing to dad?

Stewie:
 [chuckles] Yeah, you're right. I bet he is on his period, whatever that means...[covers his ears, as through Rupert is telling him what it means] LA LA LA LA! STOP STOP STOP! GROSS GROSS GROSS! EW EW EW! NO NO NO! EW!

Peter:
 No! No. No, not...not you. Not you.

Peter:
 This is the best thing to happen to me, since I became a wise cracking, fourth wall breaking superhero!

Peter:
 Call me Redstool. The treatment didn't give me powers, but it did spread cancer to my anus.

Brian:
 Oh my God, Stewie, I am so sorry. I...I...I was drunk. It was an accident. I...I must have thought he was a chew toy.

Stewie:
 How 'bout I do that?

Stewie:
 Shut up. Stop trying. It's over.

Stewie:
 Look at me. Watch. See what I'm doing? Twitter, unfollow. Instagram, unfollow. Snapchat, unfollow. And there we go. Done.

Lois:
 I'm gonna have 'middle-aged woman boobs falling off the side' sleep now.

Brian:
 It's a stuffed animal, Chris.

Chris:
 Yeah, well, he cremated that stuffed animal and he's going to Vermont to scatter the ashes.

Brian:
 What!? I've gotta go after him!

Chris:
 Not until I finish fitting this. How you feelin'? Bue o? Fits good?

Brian:
 This isn't mine.

Chris:
 [serious] Do you or do you not feel bonita?

Brian:
 Stewie!

Stewie:
 Hmm, well, violent murderers can often be found at bus stations, so why am I surprised?

Brian:
 HE IS NOT DEAD! HE WAS NEVER ALIVE!

Stewie:
 YOU TAKE THESE WORDS BACK!

Brian:
 HE WOULDN'T CARE. HE DIDN'T HEAR YOU, HE'S A DOLL!

Stewie:
 HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND!

Brian:
 [releases Stewie] I'm supposed to be your best friend.

Stewie:
 But you're not! You're BLOODTHURSTY COLD-BLOODED MURDERER!

Brian:
 Fine! You're right. You know what, it wasn't an accident. I knew he wasn't a chew toy! I was sick of you talking to him all the time. I was sick of you complaining to him about me when I was right there in the room. I was sick of always playing second fiddle to that bear. HE'S NOT! EVEN! REAL!

Stewie:
 You...did this...on purpose?!

Stewie:
 This isn't going to make me forgive you, you know.

Brian:
 That's fine.

Stewie:
 I'm going to say uncomplimentary things about your ass the whole way.

Brian:
 Go ahead.

Stewie:
 You know, maybe it's appropriate that you're my ride up. Rupert always called you my bitch. Want to know some of the other things he called you? Fat Lassie, Scooby-Don't, Rin-Tin-Twink, Poopy Snoopy, Marmadukey, Clifford the big red sphincter that we can see all the time because you don't put your tail down, Snoop Doggy Dick.

Joe:
 Is it weird that we're in a group text with our friend's wife, but not our friend?

Quagmire:
 No, what's weird is that your Bitmoji can walk.

Joe:
 [angry] I'm allowed to have legs in the phone world!

Brian:
 Stewie, I just don't get it. You're so mature in so many ways, you're ... you're the smartest person in the house, you're incredibly perceptive, you're wiser than people 40 times your age. Why is Rupert the one baby thing you're hanging onto? Why are you so upset over a doll, when I'm real and I'm still here?

Stewie:
 Because Rupert was going to be with me forever! He wasn't ever going to leave.

Brian:
 So what? I'm not leaving you either.

Stewie:
 Oh, really? Brian, let's be honest. You're a middle aged dog. You don't have that many years left and one day, all too soon, I'm gonna be crying at your funeral in an Armani suit, and people are gonna be like "Oh, nice suit." and I'm gonna be like "Why are you talking about my awesome $2,000 suit? My friend's dead!"

Brian:
 Feels like that story is less about me and more about your suit.

Stewie:
 [joking] Hey, when are they gonna put in that elevator, right?

Hiker:
 [not amused] Yeah, that other guy said that to me.

Stewie:
 [angry] Nice shorts.

Cleveland:
 For the record, I would have preferred to dress as Frankenberry.

Quagmire:
 That doesn't make any sense.

Cleveland:
 And this does? If anything, we all three should have been Snap, Crackle, and Pop.

Joe:
 Yeah, we...missed an opportunity there.

Cleveland:
 Silly rabbit, Count Chocula tastes Grrrreat!

Young germ:
 Where are we going, father?

Germ:
 To a place better than this, son.

Both:
 YAY!!!

Stewie:
 Okay, Brian, now pour it out.

Stewie:
 Pour it out. Whatever you have, pour it out.

Brian:
 I have a Gatorade bottle full of pee from the bus.

Stewie:
 Pour it out for Rupert.

Pritchfield:
 It is creating a bit of a controversy. [pronouncing "controversy" as "con-traw-ver-sy"]

Stewie:
 'Scuse me?

Pritchfield:
 A controversy.

Stewie:
 I don't know what that is.

Pritchfield:
 Controversy.

Stewie:
 Contrawversy? [realization] Oh! Oh, controversy.

Pritchfield:
 Apologies, those of us with British accents, pronounce it, "contrawversy". But how wold you know that?

Stewie:
 Yeah, how would I know that? Look, Dr. Pritchfield, Cecil, if I may.

Pritchfield:
 It's pronounced "Seh-sel".

Stewie:
 Dammit!

Stewie:
 I only pushed Tyler down the stairs because I like him and I'm afraid he won't like me back. And ... And not like him, like him, I'm not gay. This whole thing isn't because I'm say so, ... so calm down. I can already see you licking your chops. I'm sure you live for the coming out sessions. If anything, I'm less gay than I used to be.

Stewie:
 "Fluid" is something I hear being tossed round a lot now, but I'm confident in my heterosexuality. That's a word, right?

Pritchfield:
 Yes, of course.

Stewie:
 Well, I like to talk about world domination. Some people don't think that I talk about it enough anymore, but 'mind your own beeswax' is what I say to them.

Pritchfield:
 When I was your age, I grew up in London, when The Blitz has just ended.

Stewie:
 Good God, how old are you?

Stewie:
 Everything about me is this carefully constructed persona, designed to keep people at arm's length. This isn't even how I really talk. [In an American accent] This is. This is how I talk. The accent is ... is nothing more than an affectation, a coat of armor to get me through the day, just an image I cultivated so I can feel special.

Stewie:
 This is my real voice.

Pritchfield:
 I don't hear a difference.

Stewie:
 [In Peter's voice] How 'bout now? Ya freakin' hear that? [In Quagmire's voice] What about now? Sound different? Giggity? [In Elmer's voice] What about now? [in Tom's voice] Coming up now, this voice. [In Seamus' voice] Ahoy, it's me. [In Roger's voice] And I'm a gay alien.

Pritchfield:
 I'm sorry, that just all sounds like the same person.

Stewie:
 I'm gonna talk to Tyler! I'm gonna make friends! I'm gonna be a normal boy!

Pritchfield:
 Yes you are. You're finally going to be just like everybody else.

Stewie:
 W ... Wha? Say ... Say that again.

Pritchfield:
 You're finally going to be just like everybody else.

Stewie:
 But ... but I don't ... [in his British accent] I don't want to be like everybody else!

Michael:
 It's Michael. I want a divorce.

Stewie:
 This is not your day.

Watson:
 Holmes, there's something I have to tell you. I'm getting marr...

Holmes:
 Yes, but I had deduced it first.

Watson:
 He's got a gun! Look out, Stew... Holmes! God, this is gonna be so annoying.

Henchman:
 Aaagh! Lucky shot!

Holmes:
 There was no luck involved. From the angle you were aiming the gun, I extrapolated the path of the bullet, and triangulated the deflection point...

Watson:
 Uh, is this... is this speech for me? Because he's dead.

Bill Cosby:
 I get away with this for another 122 years, you see.

Peter:
 Enjoying all the old-timey jokes? Don't worry, next week, back to a normal episode.

Holmes:
 What are you in for?

Prisoner:
 Ah, I Rathboned somebody's Cumberbatch.

Brute:
 Oh, this...this thing was open. That shouldn't be open, right?

Holmes:
 No, no I wouldn't think so.

Brute:
 Ah, the world's changed since I've been in there. That puddle wasn't here. That cloud wasn't there. That window was open. That lady was four feet that way.

Oscar Wilde:
 I prefer men with a future and women with a past.

John:
 All I would have done was be a perfect gentleman.

Watson:
 Sorry we didn't catch the murderer, Holmes, and I'm afraid you'll have to catch her without me. My wedding is tomorrow.

Holmes:
 Yes, about that, you know, I was thinking. Maybe you should put that off for a while. You know, sow a few more wild oats.

Watson:
 Oh, I've done enough of that, my friend. Especially after that raucous bachelor party trip you threw for me in Las Vegas.

Holmes:
 So, when do the strippers arrive?

Watson:
 1952.

Watson:
 I ... I can't believe it. My beloved Constance is the murderer.

Holmes:
 It's even worse than you think. If she's a murderer from this time period, that means there will be a terrible, pretentious musical about her one day.

Actor:
 [singing] Behold the tale of Constance, the murderer in the bonnet.

Backup:
 [singing] The murderer in the bonnet.

Holmes:
 Oh, I was wrong! I love it!

Watson:
 This way, Holmes! She's headed toward ... Holmes?

Holmes:
 I couldn't come here and not do this. [to Miss Clavel] She has appendicitis, by the way.

Holmes:
 We made it just in time and I was able to fool you, as I am a master of disguise.

Watson:
 Seems like you're just good at dressing up like a woman.

Watson:
 One last mystery to solve. Why do they call you, "Professor"?

Moriarty:
 I teach at Hogwarts.

Holmes:
 Really?

Moriarty:
 No, but we should have done that instead of this.

Eric Dane:
 [reading Peter's hat] USS Nathan James?

Brian:
 Wow, Stewie. I am so sorry I became such a jerk. But I guess I learned my lesson about the evils of Wall Street.

Stewie:
 What are you talking about? This isn't about Wall Street, this is about you.

Brian:
 Me?

Stewie:
 I've been investing in the market forever, and doing just fine. You did it for one week, and were literally eating your own kind. This isn't about Wall Street. I cannot stress that enough.

Brian:
 Well, money is the root of all evil.

Stewie:
 No, it's not. It's just you.

Peter:
 For 60 years, Sunday has met God, Football, and Family Guy, and later, to a lesser degree, The Simpsons.

Chris:
 What's going on when a guy says a girl has a red scare in her Harry Truman?

Chris:
 Can we get a television set?

Peter:
 Sorry, Chris. We don't got the money. I spent our entire savings, building that fallout shelter we never get to use.

Brian:
 Why don't you just buy a TV for the weekend, watch Elvis, and then return it on Monday and say it doesn't work.

Stewie:
 Boy even in the fifties, you're a scumbag.

Donna:
 [outraged] Elvis Presley is white!? Cleveland did you know about this?

Peter:
 TO THE MOON, LOIS!

Lois:
 To the moon? Wha ... what does that mean?

Peter:
 You know, to ... to the moon.

Lois:
 Okay, you're threatening to punch me so hard, I'm gonna fly to the moon? Like ... like it's funny to hit me so violently, my body will fly out of the atmosphere.

Peter:
 Well, it's not funny anymore.

Meg:
 Mom, dad, Chris is gone. He went to Woodstock.

Lois:
 Now, Meg, nobody likes a snitch.

Meg:
 I'm not a snitch. I just tell it like it is.

Peter:
 Dammit, Meg!

Mike Brady:
 Excuse me, Peter, maybe I should handle this.

Meg:
 Mr. Brady?

Mike Brady:
 You know, Meg, when you tattle on someone, you're not just telling on them, you're telling on yourself, and by tattling on someone, you're really just telling them, I'm a tattle tale. Now, is that the tale, you wanna tell?

Meg:
 I never thought of it that way.

Chris:
 Oh no, my dad!

Peter:
 [far offscreen] Chris!

Chris:
 He'll be here in 10 minutes! I gotta hide!

Peter:
 Drugs turn you into someone you're not. But you know what? We love you just how you are. That's why I'm so grateful I got here before you dropped acid or took any kind of drugs that ... you're ... you're tripping right now, aren't you?

Chris:
 A little.

Peter:
 God, there's nothing on.

Peter:
 There we go.

Peter:
 Lois, why is my son playing with a vacuum like a girl? Here, play with this discus and javelin. Then you can grow up like a man, like track and field star, Bruce Jenner, the greatest man in the world. Maybe, you'll even end up on a box of Wheaties.

Stewie:
 Didn't these use to have nuts in them?

Anton:
 [to Chris, who is in Brian's body after ramming Brian's car] Oh, you think I forgot about you? You owe my wife 100 bucks for a lavatory misunderstanding.

s Wife:
 Hey, sugar.

Chris:
 I've never seen you before in my life.

Brian:
 Yeah, what are you even talking...? [realizes] Oh, Stewie.

Lois:
 [to Brian, who is in Peter's body] You didn't listen to a word Dr. Johann said, did you?

Brian:
 No, I did not. [turns to her] I mean... [chuckles nervously] the movie Road House.

Ollie Williams:
 [with Tricia Takanawa's voice] I'm standing here for some reason doing the weather in a giant black man's body.  What kind of a Friday is this?

Tricia:
 [with Ollie's Voice] FREAKY!!

Ollie Williams:
 [with Tricia Takanawa's voice] Back to you, Tom.

Mayor West:
 [Reading from the book of Just Jared] Death be the ultimate fail.

Hammer:
 Peter you're doing great as a millennial. Next thing is you gotta be on Fleek.

Peter:
 "On fleek"? People still say "on fleek"?

Peter:
 [Complies] Yay! [Peter and Fleek ride past a collection of various images] Our country's involved in six different wars, but millennials think about this stuff!

Peter:
 What's that? Sorry, I was too busy taking a selfie while shooting a Snapchat while periscoping that Snapchat while Instagramming latte art while Shazaming the Weeknd while streaming Master of None while retweeting George Takei while saying, "This wins the Internet!" while still being #sooobored. Hammer? Hammer? Come on, man. Don't make me look up from my phone.

Peter:
 Artisanal what? Is it pretzels? Is it artisanal pretzels? Has that been done? Does anyone know if artisanal pretzels is a thing? It seems so obvious, yet I don't think I've ever seen them. I better do millennial CPR! One! Ugh, whatever. Two! Ugh, whatever. Three! Ugh, I'm gonna let my parents take care of this.

Lois:
 Listen! I made breakfast and drove, so if there's a dead dong, I'm gonna look at it!

Quagmire:
 It's just so sad that young people can't pay attention to something longer than six sec... [Cut to a live-action clip of a man losing his grip of a trapeze bar. Camera zooms out to reveal Peter, Joe and Cleveland watching the clip on a phone] What the hell, you guys? I was talking! You know, there's more to life than just what's on your phone!

God:
 Wrong, idiot. ["Emergency alert from Africa" appears on God's phone] Anyone know how to turn these things off?

Peter:
 I'm Peter Griffin, and this is The Six Second Talk Show. My guest tonight is Joe Biden, and that's all the time we have. Thanks for watching, goodnight. How was that?

Quagmire:
 Eh, kinda dragged.

Cleveland:
 It's The Six Second Talk Show, and now, your host. Heeeeeeeeere...

Chris:
 Find the corners.

Peter:
 It's not a puzzle, Chris.

Lois:
 You gotta fold on the creases.

Peter:
 I'd be able to find the creases if somebody had folded it correctly last time.

Lois:
 I did fold it correctly.

Peter:
 No you didn't, and then you jammed it into a backpack, and now I'm in this mess.

Lois:
 Don't blame me. You ripped it up when you were tearing through the backpack for your snacks.

Peter:
 Ok, this is why I wanted to bring a globe! All right? You don't have to fold a globe.

Lois:
 Who the hell would bring a globe on vacation?

Joe:
 [Nearby with a globe] See, Bon? We're eating food, and they're tearing each other apart. Where to next, mon cheri?

Peter:
 Where's your nearest bathroom?

Parker Stanton:
 Gender fluid?

Peter:
 Yes, there will be a lot of that.

Driver:
 I have no idea how to drive without texting!

Brian:
 There's a taxi stand.

Peter:
 Dead. Dead. Dead. Barely alive! To the airport!

Peter:
 We can play charades.

Chris:
 Oh, you mean like your marriage?

Peter:
 Chris, I told you that in confidence.

Peter:
 If you wanna tweet something, you do it the old fashioned way: write it on a piece of paper, staple it to a bird, and throw it out the door. [Demonstrates]

Joe:
 Hey, Peter, who are these guys?

Peter:
 Oh, this is just my looping GIF of black teens reacting to a very mild burn.

Joe:
 Huh, sounds kinda pointless.

Peter:
 Oh, you mean like your feet?

Black Teens:
 Oh!

Peter:
 Look. We're getting a signal! I think we fixed the Internet! Something's coming through!

Worker:
 It looks like an ad.

Peter:
 Smithwork's artisanal pretzels. Son of a bitch!

Lois:
 Well I'm glad you got the Internet...hold on. I'm sorry, what were you saying?

Peter:
 Yeah, sounds good. [Takes picture of genitals] And send. Take that, Delta Airlines.

Rod Sterling:
 Submitted for your approval. A restaurant full of people so distracted by their phones, they're unaware that they're all about to go up in smoke, just like the FOX Tuesday night lineup.

Bill Cosby:
 Good morning, ya see. I gathered y'all together: Kevin Spacey, Roman Polanski...hey, hey, hey, Woody Allen, Steven Seagal, Matt Lauer with the pudding pop...[Lauer poses at Cosby] Brett Ratner, and you, lesser-known offender, James Toback.

Harvey Weinstein:
 [in his Hulk-like voice] Don't forget me! Harvey shower.

Bill Cosby:
 Nobody knows about all of us. He's very aware of what's goin' on here, ya see.

Peter:
 If anything were to happen to me Lois, I'll miss you more than Life...the cereal, but not the board game which I quite enjoy.

Lois:
 OK.

Meg:
 [sarcastically] Thanks dad.

Peter:
 Thank you God!

God:
 Bless you my child...pornography fan.

Stewie:
 You're a selfish horn dog, who's getting to old for the game.

Brian:
 I beg to differ. I think I've got the lingo of today's lady down pat.

Brian:
 Hey, might I Pintrest you in a Drink.0?

Jess:
 Yes! Everything about it is awful: the people, the music... [says it with Brian] if you can call it music.

Jess:
 [giggles] I like you, Brian! You actually say what's on your mind.

Brian:
 Sorry I barked when you took your pants off. I thought it was a squirrel.

Lois:
 Chris, pass me a turkey leg, would you? I prefer the limbs.

Chris:
 I got a limb fo' ma.

Peter:
 I love every Tom Hanks movie, except for Terminal. You know, there's nothing worse, than when you're flipping channels and you're like. Oh, God it's Terminal! Don't say it's terminal! God, what have I done to deserve this? Why does it have to be Terminal?

Chris:
 Sir, I will tell you a great Tom Hanks movie. Catch Me If You Can, sir.

Peter:
 The business died and I lost $200,000, Brian. Wanna know why? "555" means it is not an actual phone number.

Brian:
 I haven't gotten this kind of attention, since I went to see The Peanuts Movie.

Helen:
 You have a blessed day.

Brian:
 [laughs] Oh, no.

Bruce:
 [sighs] Yet another wedding I'm on this side of, Jeffrey.

Bruce:
 We's just waiting for his mama to die.

Jess:
 I vow to honor you, and cherish you until the day I die ... a week from Wednesday.

Bruce:
 By the power bottom vested in me...

Lou:
 [offscreen] Welcome back, Brian.

Audience Member:
 That's Lou, the apartment manager, from when Brian moved out!

Lou:
 Ain't that something to flip your biscuit?

Lou:
 That's my thing I say, remember?

Brian:
 Oh, ... uh, no I ... I can't imagine anyone does.

Stewie:
 So, Bri, this is once again your Hell hole. I was going to help you move in, but you don't really own anything, do you?

Brian:
 Yeah, we didn't bother to register for gifts because [shouting to Jess] she was supposed to die!

Tom:
 Well, Brian, I think I speak for all of us, when I say: If you ever take that love away from Jess, I hope people walk right up to you on the street and punch you in the junk.

Brian:
 Ain't that something to flip your biscuit?

Brian:
 Nothing?

Brian:
 Somebody call 9-1-1!

Brian:
 Dammit, Fox! That's not an invitation to ruin our moment to expand your media empire!

Brian:
 [sigh] Son of Zorn.

Brian:
 Ha!

Quagmire:
 Hey, pal. Listen, I...I know we've had our differences, but...you're a good guy.

Brian:
 Thank you, Quagmire.

Quagmire:
 Listen, I wanna throw you the wildest bachelor party of all time. It's gonna be crazier than whatever Kanye West is doing at this particular moment.

Kanye West:
 I'm giving this lasagna a massage, while preparing to announce I'm joining ISIS! Thank you for your interest!

Stewie:
 It's possible we've taken this too far.

Brian:
 I'm warning you, if you kill me the internet's gonna freak out.

Lois:
 Oh, Meg. You have to babysit for Stewie, Saturday.

Stewie:
 You have a pager?

Chris:
 Yeah.

Stewie:
 You get paged?

Chris:
 Yeah, that's how a pager works.

Stewie:
 Why don't you just get a phone?

Chris:
 Um, you mean one of your government tracking devices? No thanks, I'm using a pager. Oh, you're looking at your steps? No, the government's watching where you're going. It's not nap time, Stewie. Wake up.

Stewie:
 I see we're smoking.

Teenager:
 We're not smoking, we're vaping.

Stewie:
 What's the difference?

Teenager:
 Smoking is for losers. Vaping is for douchebags.

Brian:
 I'm a dog. I can hear everything. By the way, the Stranger Things monster just farted.

Hal:
 Whoo! Must have been that fat chick I ate.

Brian:
 Jess is having me put down!? Oh my God! This can't be happening!

Clifford:
 Did you also eat a kid?

Peter:
 When is Brian coming back?

Jess:
 Oh, never. I'm having him euthanized.

Peter:
 Euthanized!? Oh my God!

Peter:
 Come on, come on!

Peter:
 Euthanize ... Euthanize ... Euthanize.

Lois:
 Well, Brian, I'm sorry that Jess died during the commercial break.

Meg:
 [to Lois] You're such a bitch.

Peter:
 She's a bitch? Meg, you said you wouldn't tell Stewie's secret!

Chris:
 Stewie, you told dad?

Stewie:
 I had to get it off my chest. I didn't think he'd understand me.

Peter:
 I understand pieces now and then.

Chris:
 You're smoking the vape pen?!

Lois:
 No, I'm smoking a real cigarette like mothers are supposed to do.

Chris:
 You're such a hypocrite! At least vaping is healthy!

Lois:
 Don't be an idiot! Vaping is just as bad and you look like a douchebag!

Chris:
 No, I don't! I look cool.

Lois:
 [hands Chris the vape pen] Go ahead. Hold it to your mouth.

Chris:
 Oh, my God! I'm a douchebag!

Stewie:
 This is a drone. Grown men, who have never had sexual relations fly them over people's houses to try and ... see something. I don't know.

Peter:
 And you sound like you were lost at sea, and told not to drink sea water, but drank sea water.

Tony Robbins:
 Peter, I was once a lot like you. Unmotivated, dangerously obese, always relying on cutaways ...

Peter:
 You know, that reminds me of the time ...

Hudson:
 Hi, Stewie! I'm putting sand on a cat poo.

Peter:
 Ah, the privacy of all glass around me.

Hudson:
 Your mom seems nice.

Stewie:
 She's a slag.

Stewie:
 Which action figures did we get?

Hudson:
 I got Kylo Ren. [pretending to be Kylo Ren] I got the role, during the two months I was a hot actor and now they're stuck with me.

Stewie:
 Let's choke on these, together.

Autistic Kid:
 I take up a great deal of the teacher's time!

Stewie:
 Victory shall be mine!

Father:
 Ha. That's what the baby used to say, when I was your age.

Son:
 Shut up, dad. I'm watching Rick and Morty.

Lois:
 This new you is a bigger surprise, than when they're making fun of a celebrity on Saturday Night Live, and the real life celebrity walks in behind them.

Lois:
 [chuckles] Oh boy. They're really socking it to the celebrity.

Peter:
 [chuckles] Yeah. Can you imagine how mad the celebrity would be? I mean, wherever they are at this particular moment. If they're watching, they must be ...

Lois:
 That's the actual celebrity, walking up right behind them!

Peter:
 He ... He's catching them right in the act! The ... The SNL actor doesn't know! Oh, he's gonna get in trouble! Look how mad the actual celebrity is! He's folding his arms and frowning!

Lois:
 He tapped the SNL actor on the shoulder! Look how surprised the SNL actor is!

Peter:
 [excited] Aaaaah! He's completely busted!

Lois:
 [laughing] How is this happening!

Meg:
 [lighting the couch on fire] I was watching upstairs on Hulu!

Brian:
 I saw it on my phone!

Quagmire:
 My plane has Wi-Fi!

Brian:
 I was afraid of losing our friendship.

Stewie:
 Friendship? Brian, you and I have never been friends.

Stewie:
 You know, Brian. I'm starting to think we're going to get through our rocky road.

Tony Robbins:
 You can't put a price on your happiness, which is why I have. It's six thousand dollars.

Stewie:
 [Explaining his cat face paint to Brian] I'm a calico and my name is Humphrey.

Lois:
 [While vacuuming] I HATE MY LIFE AND NOBODY CAN HEAR ME SAY IT RIGHT NOW.

Stewie:
 Oh, it's a dog whistle.

Stewie:
 I've always wondered what that sounds like to you.

Gilbert:
 DOG WHISTLE! DOG WHISTLE! WHERE ARE YOU, DOG!?

Stewie:
 What's with your gay character names, lately? Stacy Jacks, Jack Reacher? Who are you playing next?

Tom Cruise:
 Oh, right. Try to make this sound gay. Next up, I play Headmaster Bates Mann.

Stewie:
 Anything else?

Tom Cruise:
 Actually yes. After that, I'll be taking the role of Major Dixon Butts, then Senator Rod Clutcher.

Stewie:
 Brian, sorry I got testy. Let's bury the hatchet. If you're free, I'd love to hear about any new writing projects, you're working ...

Stewie:
 At least wait for me to send it.

Stewie:
 Well, Brian. You seemed to enjoy belittling me, so I decided to belittle you.

Brian:
 I'm sorry!

Brian:
 For calling you a shrimp.

Stewie:
 And?

Brian:
 What do you mean, "And"?

Stewie:
 Come on, you know what I want.

Brian:
 And ... all four chairs would totally turn for you, on The Voice.

Stewie:
 I'll have what she's having.

Exterminator:
 Hi, I'm the exterminator.

Peter:
 An Ex-Terminator? So, you used to be a Terminator?

Exterminator:
 No, I kill rats and bugs.

Peter:
 And Sarah Connor.

Lois:
 No, Peter. We have a rat.

Exterminator:
 My stuffs in my truck. [puts on shades] I'll be back.

Vernon:
 My name's Vernon. I'm a water bear.

Brian:
 Water bear? What's a water bear.

Stewie:
 They're predominantly water-dwelling, eight-legged, segmented micro-animals. They're also known as a moss piglet or a tardigrade.

Vernon:
 You can call me "Tardy", but I'm always on time.

Black Water Bear:
 Flagellum? I don't even know 'em!

Brian:
 I can't believe there's this whole universe, hidden here in your rug ... where everyone speaks English.

Stewie:
 Okay, Brian, take the ride.

Gay Water Bear:
 I'm the gay one, but ... I'm not ... like, doing the gay voice.

Patrick Stewart Water Bear:
 Patrick Stewart!

Prince:
 Meg, Chris, come to the light.

Chris:
 Meg, no! Don't do it! Don't go to Prince!

Prince:
 Come to the purple light, Meg. Come taste infinity!

Chris:
 Don't listen to him, Meg!

Meg:
 But he's so talented and he's got so many drugs.

Gay Water Bear:
 Oh my gay God!

Stewie:
 [referring to a well-endowed pony at a birthday party petting zoo] The pony was magnificent.

Lois:
 [oblivious to Stewie's comment] The pony was magnificent.

Carter:
 I did what?

Brian:
 [To Lois] So what'd you do with the gun?

Peter:
 [attention drawn] Gun?

Lois:
 [referring to Peter's performance during her 'birthday sex'] Unlike you, guns can actually fire.

Chris:
 I don't think this marriage needs a gun.

Lois:
 [Explaining to Meg why Babs can't take care of Carter] Well, she's busy. She went to Antarctica to steal a penguin.

Peter:
 [attention drawn] Penguin?

Babs:
 [Angrily holding a gun on the family after shooting Carter in the head] Who told Carter he could give away our fucking money?

Peter:
 [With Carter back to his old self] Aww, the gunshot changed him back.

Peter:
 Happy birthday, Lois. You know, today, you officially become the oldest woman I've ever slept with.

Lois:
 Yes, you said the same thing last year.

Peter:
 Well, unlike you, that joke never gets old. Oh, and I forgot to pick up the cake.

Lois:
 I'm trying to explain that guns are hazardous and unsafe! Not have a conversation about a tepid 1990's Canadian sketch group.

Carter:
 You're wrong about guns and comedy. I'm out of here! Buh-bye!

Lois:
 Was that a tepid 1990's David Space reference?

Carter:
 [offscreen] People are allowed to like things!

TV Announcer:
 We now return to The Orville on FOX.

Chris:
 Why do you hate that show so much?

Peter:
 [voiced by someone else] Because it's preventing me from doing my work here at Family Guy.

Carter:
 [whispering] Don't do anything to scare him. He flew on my shoulder, while I was having a lemonade.

Lois:
 Daddy, I ...

Carter:
 [angered] What?

 Hartman:
 Hey, quick question? Any of you guys know how to counter-sue somebody?

Lois:
 Daddy living here is gonna be a big adjustment and we're all gonna have to make sacrifices. So Meg, Daddy will sleep in your room and Stewie and Chris, you stay where you are.

Meg:
 What? I'm the only one sacrificing!

Lois:
 Don't be ridiculous, Meg. I said everybody's names.

Chris:
 I don't get it.

Stewie:
 Neither do I.

Chris:
 Oh my God!

Stewie:
 Dad's beautiful!

Peter:
 So, ideas. How do we make Carter mean again?

Meg:
 Why don't we hire a prostitute to bring him almost to completion?

Peter:
 Okay, don't love that my daughter came out of the gates with that.

Meg:
 Why don't we take him to a truck stop bathroom and then after completion, we ...

Peter:
 Okay, Meg. Are you trying to get a rise out of me? 'Cuz guess what, young lady. It worked.

Meg:
 Well, at least I'm saying real ideas and not just repeating things I've seen in children's programming.

Chris:
 Yeah, dad, I kind of agree with Meg. It seems like you're going for comedy over substance.

Peter:
 I see. Well then, I have one last idea how to make Carter mean. [bursts into tears] Turn him into one of my kids!

Peter:
 Alright, here's the plan. I clothespin his balls. Meg and Chris, you twist his nipples in opposite directions.

Meg:
 I'm glad you came around.

Lois:
 Guns create problems, but they solve them too.

Peter:
 You said it, Lois. And you know why else has a gun? Stan Smith. Take it away, Stan!

Lois:
 Peter, that's ... that show's not on after us anymore.

Lois:
 No, Peter wait!

Principal Shepherd:
 Nope. Too late. He said it. I'm marking it.

Principal Shepherd:
 Didn't get The Wus. They're very smart. Asian. Maybe they didn't understand me. I don't know.

Lois:
 Why Meg, don't you look pretty today?

Meg:
 Thanks mom.

Chris:
 I can't believe I have to go vocational school. Does this mean that I'm a failure?

Teacher:
 Alright, settle down, ya yuks. We got a new student, Chris Griffin. So, everybody give him an Ayyy!

Meg:
 Dad! Dad get off me! Get off me dad!

Lois:
 Peter, leave the baby alone. Why don't you pick on someone your own size, like William Howard Taft.

Lois:
 And Meg, why are you on the couch? You know you're not supposed to be on the furniture.

Italian Kid:
 Guys! Just called Pete's! They're closed forever!

Other Italians:
 [shocked] What!?

Chris:
 Who answered the phone?

Stewie:
 Ello, ello, ello. What's all this, then?

Italian Kid:
 Mr. and Mrs. G, thanks so much for havin' us over for dinner.

Lois:
 Oh, it's our pleasure. Chris has said so many nice things about you.

Rocko:
 Ay, maybe one or two of them are true.

Neil:
 I just looked at some porn and I need you guys to give me some assisted relief. I can't do it myself. It's the sabbath.

Brian:
 Okay, this ... this is ... starting to sound a little weird.

Neil:
 It's not weird. It's Jewish.

Brian:
 I can't believe we did all that, and he still turned us down.

Stewie:
 I know and al ... also, Brian. It's Thursday.

Kevin:
 Hey, guys? Can you hold my phone and point it over this way? I wanna live stream my suicide.

Brian:
 Yeah, sure Kevin.

Brian:
 You know what it is, Stewie? It's a selfishness. It's an inability too look out and see someone, who needs someone. It's ... it's just ... it's a lack of empathy.

Kevin:
 Can you make sure I'm totally in the frame?

Brian:
 [to Kevin] Yeah, I'm not a pro. You get what you get. [to Stewie] Anyway, what is wrong with people, that they're so myopic, and j ... preoccupied with their own little lives?

Kevin:
 Is it on?

Brian:
 [to Kevin] It's whatever it was, when you handed it to me. [to Stewie] The point is, there's someone out there for everyone, if they're just willing to open their eyes and look.

Meg:
 [singing] Let the sun shine. Let the sunshine in. Let the sun shine in.

Peter:
 Should have called it, "Too Much Hair".

Principal Shepherd:
 Oh my God! That is not what a testicle is supposed to look like! Has a doctor seen this?

Woman:
 Twenty four of us selected the salmon, sixteen the filet, and six vegetarian.

Vegan:
 [offscreen] One vegan.

Woman:
 [annoyed] Five vegetarian. One vegan.

Peter:
 Chris, we're worried about you and your new friends.

Chris:
 Pa, don't worry about it.

Peter:
 Don't worry about it ... okay.

Chris:
 A guy letting me back into school says what?

Principal Shepherd:
 What? Dammit!

Meg:
 [Telling her family about making the Olympic team] I'm a bi...

Lois:
 [Taking a sniff before realizing she's alone] That's weird, it doesn't smell like open butt in here.

Meg:
 How could you guys not know about this? I've been training for years.

Brian:
 Peter, ... Peter, I need you to hold my ears. [barfs]

Meg:
 Okay, I'm off to go train for the Olympics ... ew.

Stewie:
 Mom! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mama!

Meg:
 Hey, Ma, I'm gonna go train for the Olympics.

Stewie:
 Mama! Mama! Ma!

Stewie:
 My goal becomes clear. The broccoli must die.

Meg:
 [in her Lacey Chabert voice] Alright, I'm off to train for the Olympics.

Peter:
 Ow, my balls!

Chris:
 I'm the Quahog edging champion.

Lacey Chabert:
 You're going down, Meg!

Meg:
 Lacey Chabert?

Lacey Chabert:
 That's right. This should be my Olympics!

Meg:
 Shut up, Meg!

Lacey Chabert:
 No, you shut up, Meg!

Meg:
 No, you shut up, Meg!

Peter:
 [offscreen] Shut up, Megs!

Stewie:
 Mine has whipped cream, so I didn't get it on the first sip.

Meg:
 I'm not really good at public speaking, so I'll just say ... farple shlup mucklebluck.

Cleveland:
 Yeah, mon. It be cold.

Stewie:
 Isn't she amazing? I feel like she's my soul mate.

Brian:
 How is she your soul mate?

Stewie:
 She looks like a baby, and she's best friends with a gay guy. Her life is my life.

Brian:
 I'm not gay.

Stewie:
 [chuckles nervously] Well, it's not me.

Johnny Weir:
 Can I just say, the shape of your head is stunning.

Stewie:
 Really? I get a lot of grief for it. Some people say it looks like a football.

Johnny Weir:
 Okay, I don't know what this is.

Johnny Weir:
 Nothing normal looks good.

Stewie:
 You two are the best thing to happen to sports, since The New York Knicks finally changed their name.

Basketball Announcer:
 Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome your 2018 New York pieces of dog shit.

Stewie:
 Oh, God. Here she comes. Act like I said something funny.

Brian:
 I don't know, Stewie. I think The Special Olympics serve an important purpose.

Korean Train Condutor:
 This illegal! I want you off train!

Peter:
 Ah, what are you gonna do about it? You're just a train conductor... [notices the conductor's foot] ...who has a huge kicking foot?

Peter:
 Where the hell am I?

Peter:
 Oh no! I'm in Iran Korea!

Chris:
 Well, at least I have a side, you neutral Swiss cowards!

Guy:
 Me? Aw.

Announcer:
 Racers, take your mark.

Guy:
 Go, everyone, but her!

Lois:
 What do you say, guys? Should we go home?

Peter:
 I don't know. I'm thinking maybe we can hang out a little longer. See what else Korea has to offer. [notices the train conductor, running up] Uh oh.

Korean Train Conductor:
 No! You leave Korea! Now!

Donna:
 [offscreen] Cleveland? You okay in there? Cleveland!

Cleveland:
 Wha...wha...wha? What? Uh...yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Mmmm, that was a good toilet dream about my neighbor and his lawn.

Chris:
 Did you know Corey got recruited by ISIS? He disappeared and now there's this guy doing ISIS videos and they think it's Corey.

Corey:
 Assalamu alaikum guys, this is Corey. Here to talk about making a dirty bomb with stuff you can find in your kitchen.

Brian:
 There she is, the wealthiest heiress in all of Newport. The holy grail for guys like us.

Stewie:
 Who is she?

Brian:
 That's Margaret Woolworth Carrington von Schumacher Chanel Astor Livingston Compte de Saint-Exupery Mountbatten Windsor Armani Roosevelt Von Trap Wykenhamp Hearst Montgomery Rothschild Johnson & Johnson Twillsworth Dolce Gabana Von Zweiger II Montgomery de LaRoche Geico Vanderbilt Lannister van Burean Butterworth How I Met Your Mother Wrigley Louise-Dreyfus Ludwig Morgan Stanley Dumont Lamborghini Forbes Higbee Winthrop Chanel Remy Martin Fitzwilliam Kennedy Motel Six Fairchild Brook Pritzker Davenport von Stolen Monty Python Ellisworth Aston Martin Haverbrook Ziff Launder Hilton DuPont Kinkaid Winslow Coors Oviatt Marlborough Pembroke Huffington Bush Mellon Sinclair Mellencamp Starbucks van Dyke III Montgomery Marriott Barrington Chadsworth Big League Chew Chesterfield Kensington Boothbishop Longbottom Nottingham Meisterburger Burgermeister Tudor Hapsburg Rockefeller Onassis.

Stewie:
 [gasp] My God. You mean, the heir to the Woolworth Carrington von Schumacher Chanel Astor Livingston Compte de Saint-Exupery Mountbatten Windsor Armani Roosevelt Von Trap Wykenhamp Hearst Montgomery Rothschild Johnson & Johnson Twillsworth Dolce Gabana Von Zweiger II Montgomery de LaRoche Geico Vanderbilt Lannister van Burean Butterworth How I Met Your Mother Wrigley Louise-Dreyfus Ludwig Morgan Stanley Dumont Lamborghini Forbes Higbee Winthrop Chanel Remy Martin Fitzwilliam Kennedy Motel Six Fairchild Brook Pritzker Davenport von Stolen Monty Python Ellisworth Aston Martin Haverbrook Ziff Launder Hilton DuPont Kinkaid Winslow Coors Oviatt Marlborough Pembroke Huffington Bush Mellon Sinclair Mellencamp Starbucks van Dyke III Montgomery Marriott Barrington Chadsworth Big League Chew Chesterfield Kensington Boothbishop Longbottom Nottingham Meisterburger Burgermeister Tudor Hapsburg Rockefeller Onassis fortune?

Brian:
 Exactly. She goes by "Pip".

Stewie:
 Pip?

Brian:
 Pip.

Joe:
 Hey! Will you put a bag on that thing?

Bonnie:
 [offscreen] Just poop into your hand if you have to. I'll be down in a minute!

Cat:
 I like this party.

Chicken:
 Pussies.

Cats:
 Cock.

Quagmire:
 That's a...that's a freshly oiled hinge.

Peter:
 You're seeming kinda cocky, and I hate cocky. Boo, cocky.

Herbert:
 I am Herbert!

Tom Tucker:
 Our top story...Newport's wealthiest heiress, Margaret Woolworth...Holy God, I'm not reading all that.

Quagmire:
 [to Brian] Listen, I...I know there's been some bad blood between us, but I...I promise it won't happen again. I hope you can forgive me.

Pip:
 What a couple of rubes. I'm finally out from under that crushing debt. I suppose I don't need this anymore.

Meg:
 Yes, that's right. It was a Meg story.

Peter:
 [Eulogizing Angela] I may have lost a boss, but Heaven has gained a princess.

Bert:
 Now some of you my find the idea of two bosses, unconventional, but ...

Shelia:
 We

Bert:
 Assure

Shelia:
 You

Bert:
 Nothing

Shelia:
 Will

Bert:
 Be

Lois:
 Peter, why are you wearing a flag?

Peter:
 Eh, it's part of my job now, because of my new bosses.

Chris:
 Uh, is it a promotion? Cuz it doesn't look like a promotion.

Peter:
 Look, I'm only here to create an amusing comparison to my current job, which I am, at this moment, describing to my family in my living room, so technically, you don't even exist.

Greg:
 Well, how do you know I wasn't telling my wife a story and you aren't a figment of my imagination?

Peter:
 I...I can assure you, that is not the case.

TV Announcer:
 We'll be right back with more Greg in the Window.

Peter:
 Well, I'll be.

Shelia:
 What are you doing?

Peter:
 Playing a game on my phone and having a beer, and God willing, going to the bathroom.

Bert:
 Are you thinking, what I'm thinking?

Shelia:
 He must be shitting on his shirt tail?

Peter:
 I'm the new Pawtucket Pat.

Meg:
 Hey, now you and Jared from Subway have two things in common.

Peter:
 No! No, that's not true, Meg! It's not true!

Lois:
 Peter, Peter. She's garbage. She's garbage. Let it go. You're the king.

Peter:
 Yeah. Garbage. Yeah.

Peter:
 By the way, Tony, I'm sorry your wife was shot by Donald Trump's children.

Lois:
 [offscreen] Hurry it up! Some of us came for Daughtry!

Peter:
 Say, Brian.

Brian:
 Hops.

Peter:
 Hops.

Brian:
 Yes, Peter?

Peter:
 Pat.

Brian:
 Pat.

Stewie:
 Stupid Brian. Can't even wave to the crowd right.

Brian:
 Hi. Thanks for coming out. Hi.

Meg:
 Good news! The biopsy was negative!

Peter:
 [to Lois] Did you hear something?

Kristen:
 Hi, Chris.

Chris:
 Oh, hey Kristen. What's up?

Kristen:
 Not much. I wanted to know if you're gonna go to the dance on Friday.

Chris:
 No, probably not.

Kristen:
 Oh, that's too bad. I was thinking maybe, you and I could go together.

Chris:
 Oh, that's sweet, but like I said, I...I don't think I'm gonna go.

Kristen:
 Well, if you change your mind...

Chris:
 I SAID NO!!!

Kristen:
 Okay, jeez.

Chris:
 I'm hungry. I might grab a bite to eat.

Stewie:
 We all just ate, right?

Brian:
 You think he could be?

Stewie:
 Hey, I've been right about these things before. Remember what I said in 2009?

Brian:
 Bruce Jenner is a man.

Stewie:
 No, Brian. That's what the press would have you believe, but he's not. Bruce Jenner is a woman. An elegant, beautiful, Dutch woman.

Cleveland:
 [to Quagmire] Only Lucifer would reveal himself to you, adulterer.

Joe:
 The only spirits I'm used to chasing are whisky and tequila.

Peter:
 That's so Joe.

Peter:
 We're like the male version of the female Ghostbusters.

Cleveland:
 I got scared and tried to run through the wall, leaving a hole, shaped like me.

Peter:
 Yeah, you can't do that in the basement, bud.

Brian:
 Stewie, I'm telling you. There's no way Chris is gay.

Stewie:
 Oh, why? Because he never hit on you? God, the ego.

Brian:
 Hey, Chris. What's up?

Chris:
 Just relaxing. Listening to some of Charles Manson's music. What's up with you guys?

Brian:
 You have 28 windows of porn, playing simultaneously?

Chris:
 Sometimes, I pretend I'm at the security desk at the mall, and everyone at the mall is banging each other.

Peter:
 Well, I'm a fat dad with white hair now. Time to become an issue at Hooters, after 9pm.

Peter:
 Hey, Ashley. Ashley! Ashley! I know ... I know what car is your car.

 Hartman:
 So, how'd you get white hair again?

Lois:
 He was scared of a ghost.

 Hartman:
 Yes, I remember hearing about this in med school ... or was it a Scooby-Doo?

 Hartman:
 It's gonna be "Dr. Ramirez" now. I'm taking my husband's name.

Chris:
 Grandpa, what are you doing here?

Carter:
 Using the bathroom. Where do you keep the nets, that you put on the bottom of guys balls, to stop them from dunking in the water?

Carter:
 What do you mean, "What"? [slaps his hand for every word] WHERE DO YOU KEEP THE NETS THAT YOU PUT ON THE BOTTOM OF GUYS BALLS TO STOP THEM FROM DUNKING IN THE WATER!?

Stewie:
 [possessed by Doris Billingsly] I think we should all go investigate the still unsolved murder of Doris Billingsly, who never did anything but overcook one dinner in March of 1962.

Peter:
 What do I do?

Tom:
 You just act like everyone else is an idiot and shout over them. That way, you...

Peter:
 SHUT UP, I GET IT!

Tom:
 Terrific! Hey, why don't you come down to the station tomorrow, and...

Peter:
 I KNOW WHERE YOU WORK!

Tom:
 Again, terrific.

Peter:
 Crime is way up and you know why? 'Cuz of immigrants. I say, as Americans, we should all take a pledge to kick 'em out!

Consuela:
 Only pledge I stand for is lemon pledge.

Tom:
 Coming up, lost dog comes home...one piece at a time.

Stewie:
 Any of these mannequins doing anything for you, Chris?

Chris:
 Eh, I don't know. I guess the one without a head is pretty cool.

Brian:
 [disturbed] Alright, that's...that's something.

Chris:
 And that bin of chopped up ones over there. That could be okay, especially the one that looks kind of afraid.

s Employee:
 Do you gentlemen need any help?

Stewie:
 No thank you, dear. We're just trying to get my brother to full mast.

Brian:
 So, Chris, have you weaned yourself off of internet porn?

Chris:
 Wait, I thought the whole point was to not wean myself off.

Lois:
 Well, I hope you're happy. You're telling lies on the news, just to boost your own ego.

Peter:
 It's pronounced "Eggo", Lois, and I will thank you to leggo of mine.

Peter:
 Lois, pack your back. We're joining the Trump administration.

Peter:
 Just what Washington needs, huh? Another talking head.

Ivanka Trump:
 Hey, dad. I want you to meet my new friend, Meg.

Donald Trump:
 Please to meet you, Meg. You have a beautiful rack.

Meg:
 Aw, thanks.

Donald Trump:
 I was talking to my daughter.

Meg:
 Holy girl boner.

Director:
 I ... I think we can use it.

Stewie:
 Dibs on the bedroom in which an intern got murdered!

Chris:
 Aw, I want the intern murder bedroom.

Peter:
 There's no need to fight, kids. An intern has been murdered in each of the bedrooms.

Lois:
 Let's give D.C. a chance, huh?

Peter:
 Yeah, Meg. Trust me. Before long, you'll fit right in here, like a cowboy in a Chinese Starbucks.

Cowboy:
 This is the most strangest place ever.

Chinese Starbucks Worker:
 [calling the names of two customers] Yi! Ha!

Cowboy:
 Aw, this ain't so different.

Stewie:
 That's like the fourth person, who's called Meg, Chris Christie.

Host:
 Later, we're all wiping our ass with the constitution.

Brian:
 Hi, Brian Griffin. They let me write some of the liberal jokes. How you liking them? Good, there's more coming.

Meg:
 Is everything okay?

Ivanka:
 Huh? Oh, yeah. Sorry to be out of sorts. I just ... Sometimes I wish I could meet someone else, who's dad is a fat idiot, who once had a hit television show and who, overtime, has worn out his welcome.

Tiffany:
 You know, Meg's dad is also ...

Ivanka:
 Shut up, Tiffany.

Meg:
 Yeah, shut up, Tiffany.

Ivanka:
 Meg, I think you'd look amazing in my brand of lifestyle products, that are designed to represent a poor person's idea of what a rich person would wear.

Brian:
 Stewie, where have you been?

Russian Guy:
 Oh, many American baby things, am I doing. So, what is your favorite ballistic missile launch codes?

Random Guy:
 With Geico, you can save up to 15% on car insurance.

Ivanka:
 I've gotta run, dad. Thanks again for getting me plastic surgery in my teens.

Trump:
 Oh, please. Every president since Washington has done this.

George Washington:
 Dearest Martha, I can not wait to once again, place my hands onto your Gates of Venus.

Harry Truman:
 My darling Bess, tonight, I'm going to drop the big one onto your Pacific Theater.

 Bush:
 Hey, Barbara Bush, working late, sleeping in office, crazy headache, you look like my mom.

Peter:
 You want me to just throw away in one day, what I've spent a whole day trying to build? A whole day's worth of work, poof! Gone in a day!

Lois:
 Meg, you expect us to believe that The President of The United States would grab a woman by her pussy? That's ridiculous!

Chris:
 Oh my God! Bob's Burgers is on! This show speaks to us young people, apparently!

Peter:
 That show, and ... and I mean no disrespect, when I say this, but that show looks like it was animated in a moving car.

Trump:
 When you walked through that door, you insulted Bob's Burgers and the hundreds of people, who work there.

Peter:
 Well, I was just kidding around.

Trump:
 No you weren't. You're just jealous, cuz it wins all the Emmys and the kids love it.

Peter:
 You seem to know a lot about Bob's Burgers.

Trump:
 Of course I do. Bob's Burgers is my favorite animated show.

Peter:
 [breaking the fourth wall] Wow. There's your headline, Emmy voters. Vote your conscience.

Stewie:
 [referring to Grover Cleveland] Well, he's not getting a musical.

Peter:
 We are done being mean and insulting, like Donald Trump is. From now on, this family's gonna be nice and supportive.

Meg:
 Oh, so, if we're being nice now, maybe you have nice things to say to me, dad.

Peter:
 Um, ... of course I do ... Your hair is um ... very ... hat. You're a ... hat owner. You're also hatted.

Lois:
 Peter, stop! Your nipples are bleeding!

Trump:
 You're not just a guy from Rhode Island, you're Peter Griffin from Family Guy. Many children have learned their favorite Jewish, black, and gay jokes, by watching your show over the years.

Peter:
 In ... In fairness, we've been trying to phase out the gay stuff.

Trump:
 Our Leslie Nielsen ratings are the highest in history.

Peter:
 Surely, you can't be serious.

Trump:
 I am serious, and don't call me Leslie.

Peter:
 Ugh, you really do find a way to screw everything up.

Chris:
 I wrote that one. Why are we so damn divided, America?

Trump:
 Peter! Grab my hand!

Peter:
 I can't! It's too little!

Brian:
 I'll tell you one thing. I'm not gonna miss Washington D.C.

Peter:
 Well, we had a lot of fun this week and changed zero minds.

Chris:
 If you wanna learn more about our president, consult the Steele dossier, which is all about getting peed on.

Stewie:
 He also, with whole heart, and full throat, endorsed a pedophile, for The United States senate. That didn't fit into tonight's narrative, but should not be forgotten.

Meg:
 And I am a proud hat owner.

Peter:
 Shut up, Meg.

Melania:
 Peter, catch! [Throws golf club] Kill him in front of me and I sex you!

Meg:
 Open your presents.

Chris:
 Yeah. You got one from Rami Malek, star of Mr. Robot.

Brian:
 Wow. He gave me the dark circles around his eyes.

Meg:
 Oh, cool! Did he also include his dead soul monotone?

Brian:
 No, I don't ... oh, oh, wait hang on. [dead soul monotone] I didn't see it at first, because it was under some tissue paper.

Peter:
 Can I get a Minion cake for my next birthday?

Lois:
 We'll see, Peter.

Peter:
 Like a real one, like not you making it.

Brian:
 Someday, I'll be gone and it'll be like I was never here at all.

Meg:
 Aw, he is depressed.

Lois:
 Sad little guy.

Chris:
 Let's not project people emotions onto animals.

Cleveland:
 I found a lump on my scrotum this morning.

Stewie:
 Who would you say is your hero?

Brian:
 Well, I guess maybe, Martin Luther King.

Stewie:
 Okay, maybe, someone you see every day.

Brian:
 Um, ... well I guess Peter is ...

Stewie:
 No no no. Like ... like ... like, somebody younger. Like ... like younger than you, even. Like that ... like that kind of hero.

Brian:
 Well, I guess Meg and Chris.

Stewie:
 Let's take Meg and Chris as a given. Anyone else, you maybe look up to?

Brian:
 I guess Lois.

Stewie:
 We did say younger, did we not?

Brian:
 Um, ... I guess that leaves, ... you?

Stewie:
 [flustered] Oh, boy. [chuckle] Embarrassing. [chuckle] That backfired, didn't it?

Stewie:
 Classic.

Brian:
 But, sir. DogBook was our idea. It was stolen by Bark Zuckerbark.

Professor:
 And, who are you again?

Brian:
 We're the Barklevoss twins ... and, scene. [to Robot Brian] So, what do you think?

Robot Brian:
 I think it's great. I have no notes.

Brian:
 It's called "The Barkial Network".

Robot Brian:
 How come you didn't call it "BarkBook".

Brian:
 [chuckle] I thought you said, you didn't have any notes.

Robot Brian:
 I got you dropped from jury duty.

Brian:
 Oh, great! What line did you use?

Robot Brian:
 I have read about this exact case.

Brian:
 That's good.

Robot Brian:
 On Hotsy Totsy Nazi.com

Brian:
 That's not good.

Stewie:
 You know he backs up his hard drive every night, right? Though I guess you were also backing up his hard drive, last night, eh? Wiping that history? Oh, what else. What other computer terms. Oh, getting some ram, a few megabytes, logging in and logging out? Wow, there's a lot of computer things that sound dirty.

Robot Brian:
 Morning, RB.

Stewie:
 RB?

Brian:
 [to Stewie] Yeah, it stands for "Real Brian". [to Robot Brian] Morning, RB. [to Stewie] Robot Brian.

Stewie:
 Well, much like every other Arby's you are making me sick.

Peter:
 You gotta help me, Joe!

Joe:
 No, way. You should have thought of that, before you committed a victimless crime, between consenting adults, in a commercial arrangement, which also created jobs and contributed taxpayer dollars to the community.

Quagmire:
 Joe can be pretty easily influenced.

Chumbawumba:
 I get knocked down!

Joe:
 Oh no!

Chumbawumba:
 But I get up again!

Joe:
 Yeah!

Chumbawumba:
 You're never gonna keep me down!

Joe:
 Good!

Joe:
 Flip Joke Massage Parlor? Well, tempted as I may be, there is no way, I'm going in there for a massage.

Joe:
 Ma'am, I assume you're giving me a great massage, but that's where it stops. I'll be a monkey's uncle, before I accept a sexual favor.

Joe:
 And that's the story of how your mother, my sister, got into college.

Barnaby Bananas:
 Ooh ooh ooh ah ah!

Joe:
 Oh, Barnaby Bananas! You're certainly my smartest nephew.

Joe:
 They ran out of those mini batting helmets, so they're serving it in athletic cups.

Peter:
 I'm using the ladies' room. How bad could it be?

Peter:
 I saw a mouse.

Guy:
 Buddy, if you really gotta go, you can use that one.

Peter:
 A bathroom for Prince?

Sheila:
 Good morning, Peter. We saw the game last night, and well, we just want you to know, that we wholeheartedly support all transgender people.

Peter:
 But, I'm not ...

Bert:
 Peter, before you say anything that might clear all this up, let me tell you about our stellar transgender employee package.

Peter:
 Benefits? I'm trans-listening.

Peter:
 Hey, what is transgender, anyway? Is that the stuff in potato chips that makes your bum go bam?

Cleveland:
 Look Peter, the good news is, you still fit in your wife's wedding gown. Not every guy can say that.

Peter:
 It's actually Meg's. She commits murders in it.

Peter:
 I just wanted to tell you that I'm the one, who planted the evidence, that got you suspended.

Joe:
 [infuriated] WHAT!? I'M GONNA KILL YOU!!!!!!

Peter:
 Uh-uh-uh, woman.

Joe:
 Oh, right.

Bonnie:
 [offscreen] Joe, close the door, you're letting the bugs in!

Joe:
 Is your daughter still killing people?

Peter:
 Wha ... What happened?

 Hartman:
 Ah, I knew you'd catch it. I'm parting my hair on the other side now.

Bert:
 Oh, Peter. Thank God you're okay.

Peter:
 Hello, bosses and not my family.

Jeff Slater:
 That is one nutty hospital.

Peter:
 Thank you for showing me the 90 things women have to do before bed.

Meg:
 What. a. day.

Brian:
 Oh, Peter. You started a Kickstarter.

Peter:
 Not exactly.

Brian:
 Oh, that's...that's not a K.

Ida:
 Look at that! You're up to six inches! That's two inches past your goal!

Chris:
 Dad, you lost a wiener, but came out a winner!

Peter:
 Well, that does it for our crossover episode. Thanks for coming, cast of Bob's Burgers.

Bob:
 We didn't get to do anything.

Peter:
 Show's 22 minutes long. Not everything makes it to air, but hey, you have the floor if there's something hilarious you wanna say. I'll just sit here and be quiet. Give us two Emmys worth of amazing. Maybe a funny burger name? No? Girl in the bunny ears? Boy, I love it, when characters are expressed by props.

Bob:
 I kinda feel like this is less of a crossover and more of a roast?

Peter:
 No, a roast is good-natured.

Guy:
 Excuse me, ma'am, could you direct me to Earth's reserve of near empty tuna tins?

Woman:
 Are you a space cat?

Space Cat:
 He's been made!

Lois:
 Peter, pretending to be transgender to get off work, trivializes a real struggle in this country.

Peter:
 Did the ... did the space cats get to you?

Lois:
 I don't know what that is, but you gotta knock this off ... and direct me to Earth's reserve of sun-dappled window seats.

Peter:
 How does Rebel Wilson always look so fetching?

Stewie:
 Does she, though?

Chris:
 You could be too, if you just let your hair down a little.

Chris:
 Now you just take that beautiful hair down to the salon, and you'll be a ten.

Stewie:
 On a scale of a billion?

Peter:
 Thanks Chris, thanks for helping me at 11:30 on a school day.

Chris:
 There was a shooting.

Brian:
 You know, I've always been a great supporter of the LGBLT.

Stewie:
 Nope.

Brian:
 LGTE.

Stewie:
 No.

Brian:
 GED.

Stewie:
 Unrelated.

Brian:
 LIE.

Stewie:
 The Long Island Expressway?

Brian:
 NKOTB.

Stewie:
 The wrong stuff, Brian.

Brian:
 WNBA?

Stewie:
 Yes ... yes, WNBA.

Meg:
 Mom, you know, our world today is filled with people like dad, trying to find their identities. Whether it's cutters, or people who cut themselves, or people who drag knives across their thighs to feel something.

Lois:
 You can just read on an impossibly bright iPad, while I toss and turn in a pissy way.

Lois:
 You almost done with the chapter?

Peter:
 Oh, there's no chapters. It's a Clifford book.

Slinky:
 Don't forget to turn in your time card, Peter. What are you, allergic to money?

Peter:
 [annoyed and exhausted] Ha ha. No. I wanna get paid. Just forgot.

Chris:
 Ladies.

Lois:
 Okay, Donna. You wanna read yours?

Donna:
 Oh, I didn't do mine.

Lois:
 Wha!? Well, then you can't have anymore snacks. You just can't!

Donna:
 Damn, that's steamy, Lois!

Window:
 Uh, yeah, really. Phew, anyone mind if I open me? [opens self] Ahhhh, see you in the shower, ladies.

Joe:
 Stairs. Why'd it have to be stairs?

Peter:
 I started using these pills called "Stiff for Hours" from the gas station.

Brian:
 A Stable Affair, by Lois Griffin. [secretly pissed off] Okay, another writer in the house.

Quagmire:
 Alright, we'll help you, Peter but we're doing it, Quagsberry rules.

Quagmire:
 A woman, or in this case, a man, has to do anything I say. No questions asked.

Stewie:
 Never walk behind a horse! You would have to hate horses not to know that!

Brian:
 [imitating Daffy Duck] You're despicable!

Peter:
 I'm so hungry! Let me out! I'll tell you what. First guy that lets me out gets his own spin-off. Not you, Cleveland.

Lois:
 [to Brian] Wait, let me get this straight. You, without asking, read something I wrote? Then, thinking I was revealing all my most intimate wants and desires, you thought that you could exploit what you read to seduce me? But, when you thought I might be cheating with someone other than yourself, you found that, and only that morally objectionable? And you bring Stewie here, who doesn't understand any of this?

Stewie:
 I predict in the finale, everyone can understand me. That would make a good finale, right?

Lois:
 I never thought a dog could be such a genuine piece of human garbage.

Stewie:
 Hey, Bri.

Stewie:
 [feeding the horse] There's a good girl.

Stewie:
 You know what I think we missed in all of this is that Lois wrote a beginning, middle, and end to something. What have you written lately, Brian?

Brian:
 Well, nothing, but, I ... I think every writer knows how hard it is to be staring at that blank page.

Stewie:
 Heh. Sounds like you did write something. Your career's obituary.

Chris:
 Hi, this is Chris Griffin. Boy, Lois had some amorous adventures this week. But you know what really turns me on? Reading. Why don't you get yourself down to the library and open up a book? Here's a few of my favorite books. J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, The Kite Runner, by Khaled Hosseini, and of course, The Dirt, by Motley Crue. Seriously, read The Dirt. They snort a roll of live ants like cocaine. Remember kids, a library card is free, but knowledge is priceless. Get that dirt book.

Quagmire:
 Here, rub this up and down on the inside of your cheek.

Quagmire:
 Ahhh! Stop saying that!

Smitty:
 Whoo! To my last night as a free man!

Peter:
 Hm, unfortunate timing.

Peter:
 I'm beginning to think those vodka cranberries may have had alcohol in them.

Meg:
 Close dancing, 12:00. Hey! Arms length, dirty porno lovers!

Principal Shepherd:
 So, going stag tonight, Meg?

Meg:
 Oh, no. I brought someone.

Meg:
 Hello, I'm in love with Meg.

Principal Shepherd:
 Well, I'm very sorry I asked.

Principal Shepherd:
 Attention students. It's time to announce this year's prom king and queen.

Peter:
 [offscreen] Natalee Holloway!

Quagmire:
 Hey, it's Glenn Quagmire. Would you tell Andrew that he is not the father?

Quagmire:
 Courtney, there's something I just gotta ask. What the heck was the theme of that dance?

Courtney:
 What do you mean?

Quagmire:
 Well, like. There was palm trees like it was Hawaii, but then there was a suit of armor in the corner, there was a big banner with ... with fish on it.

Courtney:
 Can we get back to the fact that you're my dad?

Quagmire:
 Yeah, you're right I'm ... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Courtney:
 Hey, is that an Instant Pot?

Quagmire:
 No, it's a Crock-Pot.

Courtney:
 You gotta get an Instant Pot. You can make short ribs in it. It falls ...

Quagmire:
 Yeah, it falls right off the bone. I know. I've had this conversation five times.

Joe:
 Hey, Quagmire. I hear you're considering an Instant Pot.

Peter:
 So, I think I had a wet nightmare last night.

Cleveland:
 Yes, 9-1-1? Someone has stolen the old Quagmire and replaced him with a respectable man. [laughs]

Voice over the phone:
 Sir, this line is reserved for emergencies only. Please end your clammy joke.

Courtney:
 I can't believe my dad knows how to fly this thing.

Quagmire:
 You wanna try?

Courtney:
 Me? Oh, I don't know.

Quagmire:
 Come on, it's easy. You don't even need a college degree, which is a very scary, true fact.

Brian:
 Yo, Courtney. What's your Instagram? I just got on there and need some interesting peeps to follow.

Courtney:
 Oh, you'll have to ask my dad. He approves all my follow requests.

Quagmire:
 [to Brian] Denied! Nice try, ass.

Quagmire:
 Hey, have you guys seen the Wonder Woman film?

Peter:
 Yeah, no.

Quagmire:
 We're going camping. Hey, you and Meg should come with us, Peter. We'll make it a father daughter bonding weekend.

Lois:
 Oh, that's a great idea.

Meg:
 Yeah, let's go dad!

Peter:
 You know who you should take instead of me? Uh, Stewie, or ... or Chris, or Brian. May ... Maybe Lois, or ... Seamus is fun. Carter Pewterschmidt, Babs Pewterschmidt, Bonnie, Joe, their son, Kevin, Cleveland, Jerome, Bruce, Opie, Carl, the "phony" guy, the ostrich, Al Harrington, Billy Finn, John Travolta from one of our cutaways, uh, all of our characters as Star Wars characters, everybody from The Cleveland Show, Cherry Chevapravatdumrong, that's how that name is pronounced, The Orville, the ship, not the cast, um, me? AW, DAMMIT! Okay, fine. I'll go.

Meg:
 Cool.

Seamus:
 I head my name too. I'm in! No? I'll drive, buy snacks? No? Okay. Everyone else is out here too.

Peter:
 Oh my God! It's literally everyone!

Quagmire:
 [angry] GIGGITY FUCKING GIGGITY!

Quagmire:
 [angry] WHAT THE HELL WAS THE THEME OF THAT STUPID PROM!? ALL THE CUPS SAID "OH, WHAT A NIGHT"! I MEAN, IF IT WAS "OH, WHAT A KNIGHT" WITH A "K", THAT WOULD HAVE MADE SOME SENSE, CUZ THERE WAS A SUIT OF ARMOR THERE. WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT? ANSWER ME!

Peter:
 I ... I think it's possible to overthink these things.

Peter:
 [to Meg] You know when this would never happen? If I was sitting on the couch, watching TV, ignoring you completely.

Quagmire:
 Courtney, I'm sorry for what I said earlier.

Courtney:
 You mean, when you completely ripped my school dance theme?

Quagmire:
 No, I ... no, there was no theme to rip. That's the point. I stand by all of that. If anything, I'm more angry.

Peter:
 Oh, it's Smitty!

Brian:
 For you kids out there, DVDs were plastic discs ...

Stewie:
 I ... I got this, Brian. Have you ever been at your grandmother's house, and you look at her weird old computer and there's like a crack on the side of it? That's DVDs.

Meg:
 Oh my Gosh! I just got it. Crab Apple.

Stewie:
 Take a lap, Meg. Think about what you said.

Chris:
 [in the episode] She wanted it more than me.

Chris:
 [in the commentary] AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!

Stewie:
 [in the commentary] Take it easy.

Chris:
 Is that my bottle of water?

Brian:
 Wha ... What?

Chris:
 That open bottle, is that yours or mine?

Brian:
 I ... I ... I don't know. Maybe yours?

Chris:
 THIS IS WHY WE NEED A SHARPIE IN HERE TO PUT OUR NAMES ON OUR WATER!!!

Meg:
 You know, for an extra $12 a month, you can ensure your screen and they'll replace it for free.

Peter:
 [sigh] Nice going, Meg. You talked over the setup of this cutaway and now we don't know what's going on.

Brian:
 Looks like Nicki Minaj, Iggy Azalea, and Madonna are robbing a bank.

Chris:
 Um, they're butt bandits?

Stewie:
 Ocean's 36-24-49?

Lois:
 Oh, I remember! They're all skanks! Getting new phones was a worse idea than a skank robbery!

Chris:
 Oh, yeah.

Peter:
 Right, skank robbery.

Stewie:
 I'm sorry, that's not funny.

Ollie:
 He came back!

Ollie:
 Mad!

Cleveland:
 This is a godless show.

Sarah Paulson:
 Oh, you guys are back just in time for my big role.

Lois:
 What the hell is this?

Peter:
 I'll tell you what it is. An homage to a classing song from The Muppet Show, sung by Kermit's nephew, Robin.

Lois:
 I guarantee, nobody got that.

Sarah Paulson:
 I know this song!

Lois:
 Oh, shut up, Sarah!

Lois:
 Are there even any jokes in the song?

Peter:
 Do you not understand comedy? It's a reference! The joke is I'm singing it!

Chris:
 Yay, I'm a bastard!

Sarah Paulson:
 This scene reminds me of the time I was being honored at the Kennedy Center.

Lois:
 OH, BOLOGNA SANDWICH, SARAH! BOLOGNA SANDWICH!

Cleveland:
 Well, that was unexpected.

Brian:
 Welcome back to the DVD commentary episode. If you're just joining us, Lois has stormed out and announced that she's quitting the show, after learning that Peter and Sarah Paulson were once married.

Meg:
 She also said Chris' dad might be Philip Seymor Hoffman.

Brian:
 More like See-Less Hoffman, these days, right?

Stewie:
 Hey, Patrick? Can we edit that out?

Patrick:
 Yeah.

Stewie:
 Okay, good. Let's do that.

Seth MacFarlane:
 Hi, sorry to interrupt, Seth MacFarlane.

Peter:
 Holy crap, it's the mouse from Sing! I recognize your voice anywhere!

Meg:
 Okay, question. Why is the girl who voices me super hot and I'm not?

Seth MacFarlane:
 You should all be thankful you're animated characters. Peter, you can drink as much as you want and nothing bad will ever happen. Lois, you haven't aged in decades. Stewie, you get to travel through time and do things no baby could ever do, and Brian, you've had sex with more hot women than a real dog could ever reasonably expect. Meg, I'll admit, you got the shaft. Your actual life is better than your cartoon life.

Peter:
 Okay, thanks for watching this outmoded form of entertainment. Now, let's all go around the horn and say what our favorite part of the episode was. Chris?

Chris:
 Pass.

Peter:
 Meg?

Meg:
 Don't care.

Peter:
 Okay, Stewie's asleep and I can see Brian driving away in his car and just so you know, he doesn't drive a Prius, like you see on the show. He actually drives a white convertible Mercedes. Basically, the car a lady realtor would drive. Uhp, animation producer Shannon Smith, I see, you're still here. You wanna say something?

Shannon Smith:
 Thanks, Peter. Actually, ...

Peter:
 Uhp, Fuzzy Door. Bye.

Peter:
 Huh. All these spray paint cans are empty.

Chris:
 [fake shock] What? Really? How could such a thing come to pass?

Chris:
 I thought they'd never leave, factory red.

Peter:
 So, I guess Thanos got the mind stone.

Quagmire:
 Wow, so now he's got all of them.

Peter:
 I guess so.

Quagmire:
 What does that mean for us?

Peter:
 I have no idea.

Cleveland:
 I knew it was gunna be us!

Stewie:
 It's like a giant garbage Hwhirl pool ...

Stewie:
 You heard me.

Brian:
 Hey, Peter. Wanna go on a boat ride?

Peter:
 Oh, uh, I can't be in stories for a couple of episodes. I'm real life pregnant.

Peter:
 This is awesome!

Lois:
 Peter, I'm freaking out!

Peter:
 Don't ... don't ... don't ruin it for me.

Stewie:
 ... Moana ...

Brian:
 Mmm, ... I never saw Moana.

Stewie:
 ... You never saw Moana!?

Brian:
 Whoa. Look at all the packaging from Mickey D's.

Stewie:
 [amused] What? Oh my God. I've never heard that. Mickey D's. That is just great.

Quagmire:
 You've opened up a whole world of middle aged legs to me.

Quagmire:
 Please call the DWP. I'm stuck in here.

Lois:
 Oh, knock it off. It's not gonna be that bad. Besides, I couldn't leave you at home. Last time I did that, the kids walked in on you looking at internet corn.

Joyce:
 So, Tricia. Tell us about your book. I understand it's been number one on Amazon, many weeks, long time.

Lois:
 When you declutter your house, you declutter your mind and clear a path to true happiness.

Stewie:
 How 'bout a clear path to dinner, bitch?

Meg:
 Oh, my voodoo doll of mom. Yeah, totally throw. It never worked anyway.

Lois:
 [offscreen] Ow! What the Hell was that!?

Meg:
 Oh, keep!

Brian:
 Peter, that's like your fiftieth bag. What could possibly be in there?

Peter:
 I glued it. Surfin' Bird, uh ... uh ... finds a way.

Lois:
 What's your next fake writing project? A rap opera about Grover Cleveland?

Brian:
 No, Lois. That would be ridiculous. Mine is a 70's funk musical about William Howard Taft.

Lois:
 Peter you don't kindle joy.

Lois:
 I'm sorry, but I'm looking at you, and I'm just not feeling joy.

Peter:
 What...what are you saying?

Lois:
 Peter I don't think I can have you in the house right now.

Peter:
 You're throwing me away?

Lois:
 Yes. I'm so sorry, Peter. I just feel like if you don't kindle joy And that's what the book said

Peter:
 You can't kick me out of my own house. The house that I pay for? That I semi-pay for with help from your parents? That your parents pay for entirely, but I get to put the mortgage coupon in the mailbox? That your parents pay for entirely using autodraft from their account while I put a pretend mortgage coupon that clearly says "Not legal tender" into the mailbox? That your parents pay for entirely using autodraft from their account while I put a pretend mortgage coupon that says "Not legal tender" into Stewie's Sesame Street mailbox? That your parents pay for entirely using autodraft from their account while Chris puts a pretend mortgage coupon that says "Not legal tender" into Stewie's Sesame Street mailbox while I hold the plastic door open for him? That your parents pay for entirely...

Lois:
 Peter, we get it.

Peter:
 Okay. What's happening again?

Lois:
 I'm asking you to leave the house.

Peter:
 The house that I pay for?

Lois:
 Hi, kids. Do you need those hats?

Meg:
 I mean ...

Chris:
 It's the foundation of my look but we can discuss it.

Lois:
 Donald Trump's hair is unusual.

Peter:
 Don't use the toilet. I'm making wine.

Peter:
 I can't sleep.

Quagmire:
 So?

Quagmire:
 [annoyed] What do you want me to do?

Peter:
 Can you read me a story?

Quagmire:
 Peter! I'm ... I'm in the middle of something here!

Peter:
 Like maybe a Clifford?

Quagmire:
 Peter, get out of here!

Peter:
 Clifford?

Quagmire:
 No! Not now!

Peter:
 Quagmire Clifford now?

Woman:
 Ugh, just read him the story.

Dinosaur:
 Gross.

Lois:
 Shut up, Meg!

Meg:
 But I didn't say anything!

Lois:
 You just did! Your voice is cluttering up my space! Get out!

Stewie:
 I cluttered my pants. It did not kindle joy.

Lois:
 It looks like there's only one thing left to get rid of.

Lois:
 The mirror!

Cleveland:
 Look, towels!

Donna:
 They don't even match.

Cleveland:
 Who cares? They're still thirsty.

Meg:
 Chris, can't you read?

Chris:
 No, I know the letters when they're on their own but when they team up like this, I'm just uh ... sort of outmatched.

Meg:
 P.S., please throw this note out. It is clutter.

Meg:
 Well, she's dead. It's a suicide note.

Meg:
 Dad, how can you be so sure Mom is at Mount Asia?

Peter:
 We cut a whole scene, where we figured it out. You gotta just trust me.

Peter:
 I don't even care that I left my phone in my pocket.

Peter:
 Our sparse, white living room looks like the John Lennon, Yoko Ono "Imagine" living room.

Peter:
 We can't afford Imagine, so just imagine this is Imagine.

Peter:
 [singing to the tune of Camptown Races] Boop boop diddldy dee dee dee. Imagine. Imagine. No religion. Nothing matters. Everything is bad.

Stewie:
 When Mommy's unstable, I feel unsafe.

Meg:
 I tell ya, Sundays are the best. Aren't they?

Peter:
 You said it, chief. [to Chris] Hey, Chris. What's the name of the girl on the end of the couch? I'm sure I've met her before.

Chris:
 I'll introduce myself to her. That'll get her to say it. [to Meg] Hi, I'm Chris.

Meg:
 Hi, Chris.

Chris:
 Well, that didn't work.

Peter:
 Heavens!

Corey:
 That Nazi stuff I said was in the heat of a very competitive Halo game and congratulations to Goldblatt69, whose people definitely do not control the media and all banking.

Peter:
 Oh, awesome! Look over there! You can take a selfie in a hospital bed to get social media attention!

Peter:
 Oh boy, well this is the last thing I wanted.

Brian:
 Hey, you know how Snapchat puts a fake dog tongue on you? How'd you like a real one?

Brian:
 Ah, times have changed. Three years ago, I would've been a hero.

Stewie:
 Three years ago, they would've been twelve.

Peter:
 Is there anything you can do?

Meg:
 Uh, yeah actually, I can [long censored beep, accompanied by suggestive hand movements].

Peter:
 [disturbed and crying] Is ... Is there anything you can do in front of your dad?

Meg:
 I can shuffle a deck of cards.

Peter:
 [relieved] Ah, good.

Meg:
 With my [long censored beep, accompanied by finger motions and gestures toward her crotch].

Peter:
 Alright, we're taking your bedroom door off the hinges.

 Hartman:
 Meg has type 2 diabetes. The one, where you're supposed to shame her, not feel sorry for her.

Tom:
 Coming up, local anchor brings a concealed weapon to work...as is his right.

Meg:
 Pancresta. Makes opiates looks like fucking baby aspirin.

Brian:
 OUT OF THE WAY, YOU OLD BAG!

Stewie:
 Brian, that's Paul McCartney doing Carpool Karaoke songs we can afford.

Paul McCartney:
 [singing] She'll be coming around the mountain when she comes. Whooooo!

Car Mechanic:
 All set. You can probably get another 130,000 miles out of this thing.

Brian:
 Well, let's see I drive about 4,000 a year so when this car goes, I'll be ...

Stewie:
 Dead for 18 years.

Peter:
 Well, I'm glad everything's back to normal.

Lois:
 No, it isn't! Meg got the dead janitor's feet, Brian and Stewie got thrown into New Hampshire by The Hulk, and you're a beam of light!

Chris:
 I have The Shining now!

Lois:
 And Chris has The Shining now!

Peter:
 Lois, just do a line of Panc.

Lois:
 Ahhh, Road House!

Peter:
 Road House.

Sam Elliot:
 Road House...is a movie I was in.

Stewie:
 Wait, Uncle Adam is dead!? Sheesh, how many people has this show killed?

Meg:
 You know what'll make you feel better, Aunt Carol? Doing an Indian guy.

Lois:
 Meg, stop eating with the serving spoon.

Meg:
 Nah.

Principal Shepherd:
 So, you'd like to rename the school?

Brian:
 Yes, to Adam West High.

Principal Shepherd:
 Well, you're a talking dog. You probably know what you're doing.

Peter:
 Do you have a gambling problem?

Principal Shepherd:
 Me? I don't have a gambling problem. [yelling at a basketball game] POINTS! JUST SCORE POINTS! I DON'T CARE WHO!

Secretary:
 Principal Shepherd, someone named Eddie Payups is here to see you.

Principal Shepherd:
 Tell him I need one minute!

Principal Shepherd:
 I like this episode.

Carol:
 I just wanted to thank you for what you did today for Adam.

Brian:
 He was a great man.

Carol:
 You know, I see a lot of him in you.

Brian:
 Oh no. Are we gonna kiss? [confident] We're gonna kiss, aren't we?

Peter:
 Aw, dammit!

Brian:
 I don't know anything about politics. Although, crazier things have happened. Harry Truman didn't have any experience.

Carol:
 Of course he did. He was vice president and before that, a United States senator.

Brian:
 Oh, word?

Brian:
 So, Carol was just going on and on about how I should be mayor and it's got me thinking. It is an interesting idea. You think I should do it?

Stewie:
 Absolutely not.

Brian:
 I mean, if not me, who?

Stewie:
 Anyone.

Brian:
 If not now, when?

Stewie:
 Never.

Brian:
 You know, why not me?

Stewie:
 A million reasons.

Brian:
 I mean, who do you want in there? Some career politician?

Brian:
 What are they gonna do?

Stewie:
 Govern.

Brian:
 Thanks, Stewie. Your support means a lot.

Stewie:
 You don't have it.

Peter:
 Meg, fart on Brian.

Meg:
 I can't. I don't have one in the chamber.

Peter:
 The one time I give you a chance, you're not ready. Chris, tag in for Meg.

Peter:
 See that kid? He's a gamer. Great job, Chris. Now go hit the shower.

Peter:
 Meg, you miss 100% of the farts you don't take. That kid's going places. He's going all the way.

Chris:
 If only they knew.

Brian:
 Thank you for allowing me up on the furniture. I don't always get to do that.

Tom:
 Oh, word?

Brian:
 I welcome a challenger. Not the one that exploded.

Tom:
 So, Brian. How's the sofa so far?

Brian:
 So far, so so.

Tom:
 I see. Sophie, so far we got a so so sofa.

Brian:
 Why are you running for mayor?

Quagmire:
 Uh, let me think. Oh yeah. Out of spite. Spite for you.

Brian:
 That's not a reason to get into politics.

Quagmire:
 That's the only reason to get into politics.

Brian:
 What are you gonna wear?

Quagmire:
 I don't know. I was thinking like a collared shirt, jacket, no tie.

Brian:
 Yeah, yeah, no tie.

Quagmire:
 Yeah, no, definitely no tie.

Brian:
 That son of a bitch.

Tom:
 First, the impeccably dressed, Glenn Quagmire.

Quagmire:
 Thank you, Tom.

Tom:
 Is that a Windsor knot?

Quagmire:
 Double Windsor, Tom.

Tom:
 Excellent. Some might describe that tie as mayoral. Next up, we have super cazh, Brian Griffin.

Brian:
 I was gonna wear a tie. He told me not to!

Stewie:
 He's already losing and it hasn't started yet.

Tom:
 As candidates for mayor, how do I put my apps into a folder? I know how to get them shaky. I just can't get them into a folder.

Tom:
 Whoa, so I can just name the folder whatever I want? [naming his folder] Tom's...stuff.

Quagmire:
 Hey, Brian. I was just emptying my bus garbage. Would you like to eat it first?

Brian:
 ...What's the catch?

Brian:
 Oh my God! We're gonna die!

Quagmire:
 Calm down, Brian. This bus has OnStar.

Melissa:
 [over the intercom] Onstar, roadside assistance.

Quagmire:
 Yes, our bus went over a cliff. We need help.

Melissa:
 [over the intercom] Glenn? I...Is this Glenn Quagmire?

Quagmire:
 Yes, sweetheart. Hi. Who's this?

Melissa:
 [over the intercom and angry] It's Melissa...from the Ramada Inn.

Quagmire:
 Oh ... The Framingham Ramada Inn or the Cranston Ramada Inn?

Melissa:
 [over the intercom and angry] Cranston.

Quagmire:
 [to Brian] Yeah, we're gunna die.

Brian:
 You know, when you think about it. We're really the only two viable candidates. I mean, you're a pilot. You're responsible for people's lives. You make quick decisions or the machinery in the plane makes quick decisions, but my point is you're a smart guy.

Quagmire:
 Thank you.

Brian:
 ...And now you say something nice about me.

Quagmire:
 Like what?

Brian:
 Like, I'm good company, that I'm smart and funny, that I'm invited to all your pool parties, that I should just come over if I hear one of them going on.

Quagmire:
 No thank you.

Quagmire:
 You are a complete tool!

Melissa:
 [over the intercom] You do sound like kind of a tool.

Quagmire:
 See? Even Melissa from OnStar thinks you're a tool.

Brian:
 You've been listening this whole time?

Melissa:
 [over the intercom] There's nothing to do at OnStar. People have I-Phones now. I just listen into cars. Sometimes, there's sex.

Brian:
 Oh, my God! You just got hit in the throat with a gentleman's dildo! Hey, Melissa!

Melissa:
 [over the intercom] What? What happened?

Brian:
 He got hit in the throat with a gentleman's dildo!

Melissa:
 [over the intercom] Ha ha! See? This is why I listen.

Peter:
 Well, Lois. You almost had a female president. I almost had a dog mayor.

Meg:
 I can't believe they canceled the election after they thought Brian and Mr. Quagmire were dead.

Chris:
 Does that mean we still need a mayor?

TV Announcer:
 It sure does, America. Who do you think should be the next mayor of Quahog? Register your votes at FOX.com/Family Guy!

Peter:
 Your votes don't count. It's a trick. They're just tracking your data.

Adam West:
 I wanna be a mayor in real life. So, I'm here to ask you to make me the mayor of your town. Vote for me, Adam West. It'll be a home run. [takes out a baseball bat with blood and hair all over it] Ugh, God! [takes out a clean baseball bat] It'll be a home run.

Lois:
 Go Stewie! Ha! Isn't this exciting?

Peter:
 Yeah, but I don't like little Kyle Kaepernick kneeling during the national anthem.

Stewie:
 Hey, Brian, you don't have a medal detector on you, do you?

Peter:
 Uhp, here comes the insurance guy. Everyone start crying about losing your new golf clubs and Grant Wood's American Gothic.

Chris:
 Oh! My new golf clubs with the titanium shafts!

Peter:
 Oh! My classic depiction of the austere steadfastness of rural America!

Insurance Guy:
 You know, I don't care. It's not my money.

Carter:
 Thank you for not interrupting my bit.

Tom:
 I've deleted all my old tweets so even bother looking for old stuff. Screen grabs can be faked.

Stewie:
 This calls for champagne.

Stewie:
 Pop! Glug glug glug. Bottoms up! ... Go with it.

Brian:
 Ugh. Korbel?

Stewie:
 It's not Korbel. It's ...

Brian:
 Go with it.

Stewie:
 Yes! I had some left over from Denise's wedding.

Brian:
 Who's Denise?

Stewie:
 Go with it.

Brian:
 Fine. How is Denise? Did she have the abortion?

Stewie:
 Abortion!?

Stewie:
 Uh, no. Her alarm didn't go off, so she missed it. So, Brian. Is this your first orgy?

Brian:
 Not going with it.

Babs:
 Bring that up again and we'll vote on it.

Babs:
 You know, Peter. You and I are not so different.

Peter:
 You struggle to get erections too?

Babs:
 I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth.

Peter:
 Boy, that probably would have torn your mom's uterus.

Babs:
 I'm not from an upper crust world either. I just had to act that way to impress Carter, who cared about that stuff. I was struggling to be something I wasn't. In many ways, I still am.

Peter:
 There's an Ed Sheeran song for every emotion you're feeling right now.

Babs:
 Ooh, no thank you.

Babs:
 To the Babsmobile!

Peter:
 You've got vehicles with your face on them too!?

Babs:
 Thank you, Peter. You've helped me more than you know.

Peter:
 Gross.

Babs:
 As a rebellious teen, I used to come down to this board walk and feed alka seltzer tablets to the seagulls.

Peter:
 Listen Babs, I...I understand what you're doing. I really do. Sometimes I feel suffocated by Lois and my stupid mother-in-law.

Priest:
 Mr. Rama Lama Lama Ka Dinga Da Dinga Dong, do you take Miss Shoo-Bop Sha Wadda Wadda Yippity Boom De Boom to be your wife?

Danny:
 I do.

Priest:
 And Miss Shoo-Bop Sha Wadda Wadda Yippity Boom De Boom, do you take Mr. Rama Lama Lama Ka Dinga Da Dinga Dong to be your husband?

Sandy:
 I do.

Priest:
 If anyone objects to this union, speak now or forever hold your peace.

Sandy:
 Mr. Chang Chang Changitty Chang Sha-Bop!

Fjurg:
 [pronouncing "pie" like "pee"] Everyone is welcome to taste my pie.

Stewie:
 I did it!

Brian:
 No, Stewie. You did it. Oh, wa ... sorry. I thought you ... Thought you said "We did it."

Stewie:
 I did not.

Fjurg:
 [pronouncing "cake" like "cock"] Good job, little boy. Maybe someday, you can come by my store and have all the cake you want.

Stewie:
 Ooh! That sounds promising!

Brian:
 Okay, that's enough.

Fjurg:
 [pronouncing "ice hole" like "asshole"] And maybe this winter, you can go fishing in my ice hole.

Brian:
 [offscreen] I said enough!

Carter:
 I think I went too big with the boots.

Babs:
 Carter? Is that you?

Carter:
 Oh, hey Babs. I hang out here all the time.

Peter:
 Yeah, he comes in here with me and I'd even take a lie detector test to prove it.

Babs:
 [pronouncing "Wednesday" phonetically] Well, good thing the bar is having lie detector Wednesday.

Peter:
 Doing what?

Lie Detector Test Guy:
 Just a few easy warmup questions. Have you ever had condomless sex with a man?

Peter:
 Okay, test over. Carter's never been here in his life.

Babs:
 I thought I wanted this life back but have you ever had a Milwaukee's Best? it's an awful, awful, AWFUL ...

Carter:
 It's one of our sponsors.

Babs:
 ... DELICIOUS beer!

Peter:
 Ah, old love.

Peter:
 Well, I didn't pay for my beer but I left a hell of a "tip".

Von Jiner:
 As you may or may not care, Family Guy is in it's 17th season, and since FOX is now owned by Disney, which will someday be owned by Netflix, which will someday be owned by Pornhub, we have decided that Family Guy is ready for a reboot.

Von Jiner:
 As most unfunny women will tell you, women are very funny.

Peter:
 Good morning, Goddess. You know, I just want to say again that you were totally right last night to bring up that thing I did wrong eleven years ago and please feel free to bring it up again any time, even if we're talking about something completely unrelated.

Lois:
 Thank you, Peter. I will.

Peter:
 [chuckles] I ... I know you will.

Judy Greer:
 How was your night last night?

Lois:
 Great. I worked out, made dinner, little family time, and had Peter's ankles up in the air, by 11:00.

Lois:
 Oh my God! Peter, there's a spider in here!

Peter:
 Yeah, I know, genius.

 Tiestraightener III:
 I hit a gay jogger on my way to work today.

Lois:
 I just don't know what to do about this thing at work.

Peter:
 Are ... are we still talking about that? I mean, it's fine if we are. We ... we just ... we talked about it before dinner and ... and during dinner and after dinner.

Lois:
 I'll make a vision board. See my success and be my success.

Peter:
 My testosterone is so low, I could not have thought of that.

Peter:
 What can I say? I love my wife.

Lois:
 Eh, it's my show. Why shouldn't this be me?

Peter:
 Because I'm the funny one.

Lois:
 Not on this show, you're not.

Peter:
 Or am I?

Peter:
 Uhp, I thought we had one more face.

Focus Group Tester:
 You know what? I don't really get Family Guy.

Von Jiner:
 What's so hard to get? You just need to have grown up in the 80's but still be a teenager.

Peter:
 Hey, what's going on in that room?

Brian:
 It's a focus group of Arby's executives, watching us eat.

Ruth:
 Hey, guys.

Chris:
 Hey, Ruth. Good gender fluid shower?

Ruth:
 Great gender fluid shower.

Chris:
 Patty, what's wrong? Why aren't you in bitch class?

Chris:
 I'm gonna go to a club I'm too young to get into a listen to a band that's owned by the same parent company as the network.

Stewie:
 Hey! Who left their gender fluid in the shower?

Von Jiner:
 I know you've been here all day, but it's not like you have jobs to go to, so I'm going to show you one more reboot idea.

Focus Group Tester:
 Which Wi-Fi should we be logging into?

Von Jiner:
 Glendale Galleria Public.

Focus Group Tester:
 Yeah, that's what I've been trying.

Chris:
 No, still no kids, but I've been practicing a lot by myself.

Chris:
 Okay, give my love to Brian and Meg and hopefully we can come down there for the season finale. No? You're just not gonna be a part of this at all? Okay, then, bye Stewie.

Peter:
 Everybody shut up!

Focus Group Tester:
 Hey, it's that sheriff from The Q!

Peter:
 Yes, unemployable neck tattoo guy.

Unemployable Neck Tattoo Guy:
 It's a bible verse.

Peter:
 Doesn't matter. Anything above the Adam's apple, means drugs.

Peter:
 'Course it's awesome. It's Netflix. Look, we're stuck being FOX. We have to deal with it, okay?

Focus Group Tester:
 What about BoJack Horseman?

Peter:
 Hard no.

Focus Group Tester:
 You get to be a horse.

Peter:
 Hard yes.

Peter:
 Normal words, but a horse guy!

Peter:
 So, any of you out there have a futon? Yeah. Yeah, right? ... I Ubered here tonight ... Man, Starbucks ... Facebook, huh? ... And how 'bout that new chip in credit cards? ... Anybody ever been to Georgia? ... The new iPhone is large ... EDM Music.

Peter:
 Hey! Hey, this is my job! I don't go down to Burger King ...

Focus Group Tester:
 That was terrible. Netflix should make 800 more of those.

Focus Group Tester:
 I thought I read you guys were phasing out gay jokes.

Peter:
 That quote was taken out of context and widely misunderstood.

Lois:
 Guys, just so sorry that any of this is happening, I mean, even once every four years just seems like way too much.

Jerome:
 What can I get for you fellas? ... Nobody touches my voice.

Focus Group Tester:
 Hey, guys. The coffee beans Wi-Fi doesn't need a password.

Brian:
 That's right, Tricia. And since I'm on local TV, [Louder] I'm gonna talk a little too loud, and then occasionally I'm gonna turn away [Quieter] from the microphone to point at things off-camera, [Louder] so my overall point is lost.

Tricia:
 Powerful claims.

Peter:
 This is the story of the greatest trilogy ever told ... The Mighty Ducks. It was a time of great nonsense, ...

Quagmire:
 I know right? You know how I always felt like I was stuck in second gear? Well, this is a new gear!

Lois:
 Alanis Morisette was America's sweetheart in the 90's. She went on to become one of the CDs in the garage.

Seamus:
 Lois, let's go take a midnight swim in Sharkbite Cove.

Lois:
 Oh, sounds wonderful, Seamus, but I have other plans.

Seamus:
 Okay, well. I'm definitely going.

Quagmire:
 Hey, guys! There's a great concert in World Trade Center Plaza this weekend!

Cleveland:
 Really? Who's playing?

Quagmire:
 They got Korn, Cranberries, and Cake.

Peter:
 Oh, that sounds delicious, but who are the bands?

Quagmire:
 Oh, they're opening with Cake.

Peter:
 Wait, shouldn't cake be last? It's a desert.

Quagmire:
 No, Korn is last. Korn is a bigger draw than Cake.

Peter:
 Corn is not a bigger draw than cake! Cake is delicious.

Quagmire:
 [reads the other bands] No Doubt ...

Peter:
 Well, I'm glad you agree with me, Quagmire, but that still doesn't address this issue of the order.

Bonnie:
 My last show was a Weezer concert.

Peter:
 Well, that's cuz everyone smokes nowadays. What band did we see last time at the Palladium?

Quagmire:
 It was uh, Blur.

Peter:
 Yeah, I can't remember either.

Peter:
 The MTV beach house was located in the most hepatitis rich part of Florida, known as Florida.

Quagmire:
 Whazzup!?

Peter:
 [chortles] Commercials. No skipping those yet.

Joe:
 So, you partying hard or hardly partying?

Daria:
 Hardly interested.

Carter:
 Hey, you're Daisy Fuentes.

Daisy Fuentes:
 Oh, that's how I say my last name.

Daisy Fuentes:
 We're having fun cuz it's not 9/11 yet.

Lois:
 Right then and there, I vowed I would never see him again.

Head:
 Eheheheheh. She said "Wood". Uhuhuhuh. That was cool.

Beavis:
 Yeah, wood! Wood!

Junior:
 Daddy, tell us more about the black 90's.

Cleveland:
 Well, Magic Johnson got AIDs and I was like "What!?" but then he came back the next season and scored thirty points in a game where no one would touch him.

Junior:
 And he caught it through heterosexual sex contact? Well, that is magic.

Quagmire:
 Forrest Gump is ridiculous! One guy does what he's told all the time and makes millions but a girl goes off, tries to be different, gets AIDs, and dies!

Peter:
 I find your argument shallow and pedantic.

Carter:
 I can't believe the wedding is just two scenes away.

Carter:
 Now, listen. We don't have much time before the wedding, so I wanna go over something, regarding the father-daughter dance. It goes, Dalla halla walla balla dalla macarena. Waca laca chaca haca baca macarena.

Lois:
 Daddy, I don't think "The Macarena" is the best father-daughter dance.

Carter:
 Well, how 'bout another song from the 90's. [singing] Casey would waltz with a strawberry blonde and the band played on! [normal] What, wrong 90's?

Peter:
 We did ecstasy, which was terrible for you and only ever made me feel fantastic. Kids, don't do it. It's too awesome. They said it would burn a hole in your brain but show me the hole.

Lois:
 Peter, that's enough.

Peter:
 If you hate pure, unconditional love and experiencing the profound harmony of the universe, definitely do not try this drug. There's also like a 90% chance you'll hook up, but really, no, don't do it. Even if you don't hook up, you don't care. But you'll hook up, guaranteed.

Lois:
 Okay, Peter. Let's move on.

Chris:
 And what was the name of that drug?

Priest:
 Do you, Lois Commondenomonator Pewterschmidt, accept this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?

Peter:
 That's a fact. Just as sure as the Star Wars movies are a perfect isolated trilogy, unmarred by additional canon.

Junior:
 Why did you have a white bronco, daddy?

Cleveland:
 I was driving my innocent friend, O.J. and his ex-wife's head down to Mexico.

Lois:
 I was having serious regrets about my decision, but was already pregnant with Meg, so there was no backing out.

Meg:
 Wow, mom and dad. I feel like I've learned so much tonight and not just about you guys but also about the 90's.

Peter:
 Oh, there's a lot more to learn about the 90's, Meg. Like for instance, are you familiar with a band called Counting Crows?

Chris:
 I think I might've heard them in a Starbucks.

Peter:
 Yes, you have. Anyway, their lead singer is this thing called Adam Duritz. He looks like if Mark Marrin had sex with a scarecrow and gave birth to a baby made of hemp.

Lois:
 I always thought he looked like The Cowardly Lion in a suburban white high school production of The Wiz.

Chris:
 That's not what that is?

Peter:
 No, Chris. But actually, the joke's on us because this Sideshow Bob burnout slept with a primo roster of 90's tail. Jennifer Aniston, ...

Peter:
 ... Courtney Cox ...

Chris:
 What!?

Peter:
 ... Winona Ryder ...

Chris:
 That guy!?

Peter:
 ... Christina Applegate, Lara Flynn Boyle, Emmy Rossum, ...

Chris:
 Well, this is just making me angry!

Peter:
 ... Mary-Louise Parker ...

Chris:
 Mmm, I hear she's difficult.

Peter:
 Lois and I are stocking up for a very special anniversary evening and I'm not sure that 5% discount was worth checking in here on Facebook.

Peter:
 Ew, Meg. Don't "like" that!

Quagmire:
 Man, I'm happy the war is over. I can't wait to get back to Troy.

Cleveland:
 Yeah, I'm just gonna plop down with my kids and watch Troy Story.

Actor:
 To the other side of that hill and beyond!

Cleveland:
 [to Junior] That's as far as we know about right now.

Peter:
 Now, if you'll excuse me, Helen's in my cabin and I thought I'd give heterosexual sex a try.

Quagmire:
 Helen! What the Hades?

Peter:
 What? She's hot. But not as hot as Medusa. One look at Medusa and I'm rock hard.

Peter:
 Now that we're owned by Disney, we can have Hercules here...No? They...They won't let us use him?...What was the point of this whole merger? .. Well, who can we use?...Launchpad McQuack? No. No. No, you know what? I'm exhausted. I'm exhausted with being told "no" and now I'm married. [groan] I'm gonna go break wieners off statues.

Cleveland:
 Are we even supposed to be at this party? If they find out we're Montagues, they might razz us!

Peter:
 Relax, no one's gonna recognize us. We got inch-wide masks over just our eyes with the rest of out faces plainly visible.

Carter:
 Juliet, honey, we need to talk. You're a grown woman now and it's time for you to get married.

Lois:
 Grown woman? Daddy, I'm 13!

Carter:
 Shh! Don't say that! Tell people you're 11! You wanna get married or not?

Stewie:
 Aw, man I must have amnesia or something cuz I don't fucking remember inviting you guys.

Peter:
 I'm...Abe Froman. The sausage king of Chicago.

 host:
 100 people surveyed, top 5 answers on the board. Name something you might say to a damned Spot.

Stewie:
 Out.

 host:
 Show me "Out".

Stewie:
 What!? That's impossible!

 host:
 Romeo, name something you might say to a damned Spot.

Stewie:
 What!?

Lois:
 "Wherefore" means "Why", by the way. Not "Where".

Peter:
 Shh. Shh. Shh. That's stupid. You're stupid.

Cleveland:
 Well, we all know how this goes.

Cleveland:
 I'm doing it!

Lois:
 Since I'm picking up a prescription, can I uh, pay for the rest of my items here.

Quagmire:
 ...I...I...I...I guess.

Principal Shepherd:
 [sigh]

Lois:
 Oh, [sigh] yourself.

Peter:
 I accidentally farted on a candle at our eyes wide shut party and this happened.

Lois:
 I'm not gonna be ignored by you, Dan!

Lois:
 Hi, Dan. It's Alex Forrest. I just found out I'm preg...Now, I'm giving you a minute to pick up the phone, hastily.

Peter:
 I GOT IT! I GOT IT! I GOT IT!

Batman:
 [angry] I SEE IT! GOD!

Lois:
 I'm pregnant.

Peter:
 Are you sure it's yours?

Peter:
 They won't outlaw abortion until 2019.

Quagmire:
 If I were you, Dan, I'd just go home and enjoy your family and rabbit. Most of these things just boil over.

Stewie:
 [sad] Aw, I was gunna kill the rabbit.

Peter:
 Alright, listen, Beth. I got something to tell you, in front of our kid. I had an affair.

Lois:
 You WHAT!?

Peter:
 I know. It was awesome at the time and frankly, I was real close to getting away with it but now that there are actual consequences, I gotta tell you the truth.

Lois:
 Dan, how could you!?

Peter:
 Look, it's not my fault. My plan was to just hide this from you forever. Also, she's pregnant.

Lois:
 How is that possible?

Peter:
 Well, when a man and a woman like each other just a little and they get in an elevator.

Lois:
 Oh, God! How could I be so blind?

Peter:
 I wouldn't be so hard on yourself, honey but I will say, at least she had a pot of something on the stove, when I came home.

Peter:
 Ah, I love relaxing here with that dry ceiling.

Peter:
 Huh, I wonder if the weather called for living room rain.

Weatherman:
 Next up, Connecticut, your living room forecast, dry, dry, dry.

Peter:
 [gasp] That can only mean one thing!

Peter:
 You deserve to die because the choices I made are your fault!

Peter:
 Alright, she's mostly choked. Let's just sit on the floor with our backs to the tub.

Stewie:
 It's just been revoked.

Chris:
 Hi, I'm Chris Griffin. I didn't have a lot to do tonight, but they did say they'd give me one minute of the end of the show to share my favorite love story. Of course, I chose the classic romantic tale of the love between a young man and pastry, American Pie. The store was all out of apple so this one is chicken pot, fresh from the oven. Here we go. [Chris sticks his dick in the pie] OOOOOOOOW! THAT PIPING HOT GRAVY! UGH! OH AND ONE OF THE PEAS WENT INSIDE! IT'S SO BURNT, I CAN'T TELL WHAT'S CHICKEN AND WHAT'S MEAT! OH GOD, NOT GUNNA STOP, THOUGH! HAPPY ANNIVERSARY MOM AND DAD FROM YOUR TEENAGE SON, GETTING BUSY WITH A 400 DEGREE POT PIE!

Lois:
 We having people over! I just got off the phone with my mom and all the Pewterschmidts are coming here for Thanksgiving.

Peter:
 I can't believe you invited the whole family. You know I hate big Thanksgivings.

Lois:
 And put the extra leaf in the dining room table.

Cleveland:
 Donna's cousins are two thirds of Tony! Toni! Ton !

Peter:
 Which ones?

Cleveland:
 The "E" and the "I".

Peter:
 Aw, no Tony with a "Y".

Cleveland:
 That is correct. We lack the alpha Tony.

Ida:
 I wish I had given you more siblings, Glenn.

Police Superintendent Chalmers:
 Swanson!

Joe:
 Police Superintendent Chalmers!

Police Superintendent Chalmers:
 My brother is superintendent of the schools in Springfield. Our parents divorced, when we were very young. I was raised entirely by our mother. He, by our father. We've never met. There's a lot of backstory and you four are under arrest!

Prison Bus Driver:
 You guys think your the first ones to have this idea? The jail's already full of dads, getting out of Thanksgiving.

Brian:
 You have prison pen pals?

Stewie:
 Yes, a lot of people write prisoners. Even Hollywood celebrity, Kal Penn.

Brian:
 Kal Penn writes a prisoner?

Stewie:
 Yeah, Ken. He lives in California. You've never heard of Kal Penn's pen pal, Ken in the Cal Pen?

Brian:
 How could I possibly have heard of Kal Penn's pen pal, Ken in the Cal Pen?

Cleveland:
 I am Kareem Abdul Jableveland.

Peter:
 You know Muslims can't drink alcohol, right?

Cleveland:
 I am Cleveland Hurricane Carter.

Stewie:
 Okay, so, ... so, what I need is someone I can work with ... Can you be that person?

Lois:
 Okay, it's a show.

Carter:
 Annie, Get Your Gun.

Meg:
 No, it's on TV.

Carter:
 Oh, ... Poirot?

Lois:
 What is that? I've never heard of that.

Babs:
 It's a Belgian detective on PBS, we just love it.

Chris:
 It's about seven castaways. There's a professor and a millionaire and a movie star!

Carter:
 Poirot!

Brian:
 No, we already said it's not Poirot. It's about people who took a three hour tour ...

Carter:
 No it's not, it's about a Belgian detective. It's on PBS.

Lois:
 The title character is played by Bob Denver.

Carter:
 It's pronounced David Suchet.

Stewie:
 Who's that?

Chris:
 I'm gonna guess Poirot.

Meg:
 It's not Poirot!

Lois:
 Dammit, just pass!

Lois:
 Okay, this is a movie ...

Carter:
 Roman J. Israel, Esq.!

Peter:
 Come on, Peter. It's him or you and ... and he's not so great. Don't forget he's the one who told you all those Schoolhouse Rock! spoilers. I had no idea that bill would become a law.

Brian:
 Wow, okay, uh...Stewie I think I know what happened. I can't tell you explicitly since we're owned by Disney, but let me just say that Santa made her 'Little Mermaid' 'Moana.'

Principal Shepherd:
 And now, Adam West High School choir's original Christmas song, "Die Hard". I see those looks. Yes, the movie was originally released in summer but it took place on Christmas eve, which makes it a Christmas film.

Peter:
 [takes out a rule book] I guess we don't need this for anything.

Chris:
 Hey, Mr. Quagmire. Getting ready for the birth of Christ?...WHICH HAPPENED!

Lois:
 She's gone! Quick, let's take the picture for the Christmas card!

Peter:
 I sent the wrong picture to Walgreens'.

Rabbi:
 I want a new TV and it can't be a Vizeo, Sony or Samsung only and I want it all set up before I turn it on. I don't wanna have to do any of the things!

Meg:
 [about to climax] Shut up, everyone!...Shut up! SHUT UP!...JUST SHUT UP!

Stewie:
 Meg, what are you doing? You look like mom, when she sits on the washing machine.

Woman:
 I'll have what she's having.

Meg:
 Mom, I think I met someone.

Lois:
 Oh, Meg, that's amazing! I wanna know all about him. What's his name?

Meg:
 Let's just call him "beard boy".

Lois:
 Ooooohhh! It's like I'm in Sex with the City.

Stewie:
 Brian, would you hand me the fat man's fancy puking hat?

Stewie:
 God this hat is deep.

Peter:
 Oh, there's my hat. Kids, I'm off to the opera.

Peter:
 This opera stinks.

Stewie:
 I've gotta hide!

Stewie:
 How did she find me? That's my best hiding spot!

Stewie:
 Oh and by the way, Rupert, after what I saw, I know you've been faking it this whole time.

Stewie:
 Next road show, Stewie and Meg. Promise. [singing] We're off on a road to Ohio. [normal] "Hi" in the middle and round at both ends.

Meg:
 Dad, I'm gonna ask you a question and how you answer it will determine the rest of my life. Were you the Santa at this mall yesterday?

Peter:
 Now, Meg. I got a question for you. Is there really a weight limit for the escalator or did I just meet some mean kids?

Elf:
 Lady, I've been thrown into so many gongs, I don't even remember my own name.

Stewie:
 Santa's a good guy because he keeps a list? You know who else kept a list? Hitler!

Kid:
 My uncle, who moved to the Idaho wilderness, says Hitler was a great man.

Meg:
 Stewie, when this is over, I'm buying you a new toy.

Stewie:
 Meg, when this is over, I'm putting rocks in my pockets and walking into the mall fountain.

Meg:
 How much longer is this gonna take?

Elf:
 I don't know. 400 minutes? One reason I work as a seasonal elf is I'm not great at time estimates.

Guy:
 [offscreen] Next.

Elf:
 See? 400 minutes! Even a broken clock is right six times a day.

Holden Caulfield:
 He's a PHONY! A great big PHONY!

Stewie:
 Time to sleep in heavenly peace.

Woody:
 Wow! Looks like that baby is all wet!

Brian:
 Just try to have a good Christmas.

Stewie:
 Uh, speaking of that, I want a new dog.

Brian:
 What's...wrong with the dog you have?

Stewie:
 Eh, he's okay. I just...I just want a new one.

Brian:
 Maybe, you can spend more time with the old one, before you make any decisions.

Stewie:
 Nah. Want a new one. Thanks, Santa.

Chris:
 Oh my God! Santa! I want a new dog!

Peter:
 There you are. I had a Hell of a time, finding your room.

Santa:
 I try to visit every mall at least once, during Christmas. Except for Long Island malls. Those people are a bit much.

Meg:
 I can't believe I ... you know, "grew up" all over you.

Santa:
 It's okay, Meg. You see, I know what each and every person needs for Christmas. For you, it was your first time seeing Jimmy Connors.

Meg:
 Alright, I'm gunna put my leg on up this back tire and take a shewee.

Santa:
 You know, you don't have to say everything out loud, Meg.

Jimmy Connors:
 Meg? Hi, Merry Christmas. I'm tennis bad boy, Jimmy Connors.

Meg:
 How did you get in here?

Jimmy Connors:
 I came in through your baby's window. You can just open it.

Stewie:
 [offscreen] Men are now just coming in at will!

Jimmy Connors:
 Meg, I think you're gonna be just fine, but just in case, here. I want you to have these.

Meg:
 Your balls?

Jimmy Connors:
 That's right. Whenever you need me, just rub my balls and I'll come.

Peter:
 ...So long bitchy 2 AM blanket pulls.

Lois:
 [From the back of the police cruiser] Fuck you, Peter.

Peter:
 Well, that's my train. Time to disappear from this life, completely.

Lois:
 No, no Peter. It's just Chris, practicing his new recorder.

Peter:
 What? I said no hobbies!

Lois:
 Stop! That sounds terrible.

Peter:
 Yeah, you can't just play one note over and over. You're not Danny McBride.

Lois:
 Well, I'm gonna have to talk to Principal Shepherd about this.

Chris:
 [sarcastic] Great, everyone loves seeing their mom inside their high school.

Lo:
 Uh, I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller, and I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat.

Peter:
 Skee-Lo!

Lo:
 What?

Peter:
 You need money!

Principal Shepherd:
 What's this forgettable misunderstanding all about?

Lois:
 My son is being taught by a bird.

Principal Shepherd:
 Ah, Mrs. Wilkins.

Lois:
 No, Mr. Mason.

Principal Shepherd:
 Right. Lot of open windows at this school.

Lois:
 I'm not gunna have sex with you.

Principal Shepherd:
 I know. I just farted.

Lois:
 I started from the bottom, now I'm here. So, ... rap.

Connie:
 Oh, my God. You're so lame.

Lois:
 I know you are but what am I?

Connie:
 Lame.

Lois:
 ... Okay, we'll call that one a tie.

Connie:
 You were never me.

Lois:
 Oh, yeah? Look down at your desk.

Connie:
 LG?

Lois:
 Lois Griffin.

Meg:
 Wait, but weren't you Lois Pewterschmidt back then?

Lois:
 Meg, go to the principal's office.

Peter:
 So, Lois. How was your first big day teaching? You pull a Mary Kay Letourneau?

Lois:
 [laughs] No, Peter. I didn't leave my family to have sex with a 12 year old boy named Vili Fualaau, get arrested for rape, give birth to his child in prison, get out, get arrested again for humping him in a car when he was 13, have his second kid in jail, get out, get married to him, change my name to Mary Kay Letourneau-Fualaau, live my life as a disgraced sex offender and then get dumped by him. No, I didn't do that.

Brian:
 She's a classic, entitled, mean girl slut.

Stewie:
 Connie D'Amico? She stopped by to see you yesterday.

Brian:
 [overjoyed] SHE DID!? What'd she say?

Stewie:
 She said your gullible.

Brian:
 And?

Lois:
 Music tells the story of out lives. For example: This morning, I woke up and saw it was a sunny day. [plays Edvard Grieg's "Morning Mood"] Then, I had some tea [plays the Oriental riff] which was from China. On my way out the door, the kitty cat ran across the piano. [plays piano sloppily] Get off of there, kitty cat. [laughs] Then, I drove to work. [plays untitled music] But then, I hit some traffic. [plays "Dun dun DUN!" music sting] That was caused by a parade. [plays "The Stars and Stripes Forever"] For gay rights. [plays the song in a higher pitch] And finally, I got to school early and diarrhead in the girls locker room. [blows into tuba] The end.

Lois:
 Okay, for the rest of the class, I will wait for the bell [bell rings] and then I will suddenly talk much louder and faster, as you're headed out the door. OKAY AND REMEMBER THERE'S A QUIZ A WEEK FROM WEDNESDAY!

Students:
 Aw, man.

Lois:
 Good, that means you heard me. This is how Hollywood thinks school teachers talk.

Lesbian:
 So, I got my blacksmith certification. I can make axes now.

Lois:
 Oh.

Lesbian:
 You in the marker for an ax?

Cleveland:
 I'll keep this on the D.L. Hughley but your next date should be with Christ.

Peter:
 I'm gonna go see what new stuff they're turning into milk.

Peter:
 [offscreen] Ooh, wood milk!

Peter:
 Hey, Lois. Do we need any jeans milk at home?

Meg:
 Guys, my mom was arrested for Connie's murder ... NO QUIZ!

Peter:
 So, what I'm supposed to be a guy without a wife now? What am I supposed to do? Whatever I want, whenever I want?

Peter:
 Who's gonna greet me in a shapeless sweatshirt, when I come home?

Joe:
 Meg, maybe?

Peter:
 What am I supposed to do now, Brian? Whatever I want, whenever I want?

Brian:
 Yeah, I was right here when you were doing that.

Peter:
 Oh, I ... I didn't hear you laugh.

Brian:
 I'm more of a smile guy.

Peter:
 Have you ever wanted to receive a vegetable in the mail?

Peter:
 [offscreen] Suck on that, Lois!

Lois:
 That was very close to my eyes, Peter.

Peter:
 [offscreen] It wasn't close to your eye.

Lois:
 That's why I took it.

Peter:
 [offscreen] It was so far from your eye!

Peter:
 Keep the change.

Daddy Pig:
 Yes?

Joe:
 Excuse me, folks. Do you have a daughter named Peppa?

Mummy Pig:
 Yes.

Joe:
 You're gonna want to sit down.

Brian:
 It's a they.

Joanna:
 I'm getting my friend a birthday card in Spanish...but he doesn't speak Spanish! [laughs]

Mort:
 Go on! Scoot! Get out of here! Or I'll do the cliche pharmacy price check jokes.

Joanna:
 [offscreen] [laughs] That's the last thing he'd wanna announce! [laughs] Oh, God!

Brian:
 Can you believe he threw us out? That's discrimination! It's just like what happened to those blacks at Starbucks.

Stewie:
 Those blacks?

Lois:
 Look at this picture of Shailene Woodley. She's so talented and overrated and weird. I love her. Isn't her hair cut cute? Maybe I'll get my hair cut short too.

Peter:
 Wha...n...no! No way! I forbid it!

Lois:
 What? You can't forbid that.

Peter:
 Yes I can. That's the one thing men are allowed to control about women. That and your uterus and how much money you make and also everything else.

Peter:
 Establishing shot!

Tom:
 We're here with local hero, Brian Griffin, who recently foiled a robbery at Goldman's pharmacy, which by the way is getting its ass kicked by the CVS across the street.

Stewie:
 Shredder? He sounds like a ski instructor with a full beard who plays average guitar and never texts me back.

Brian:
 He's a dog I used to run with back when I was living on the street. I haven't heard from him in years. I'm actually surprised he's still alive. He just drank all the time and tried to get laid. Hard to be friends with someone like that.

Stewie:
 Yes, it is.

Peter:
 Excuse me, sir but this is a private residence.

Peter:
 You look like Anne Hathaway in Les Misera-

Lois:
 [infuriated] DON'T YOU EVER COMPARE ME TO FUCKING ANNE HATHAWAY! EVER!

Peter:
 [cowering] You're right. You're right. I'm...I'm sorry.

Peter:
 With my boobs and your hair everybody's gonna think we're a lesbian couple.

George:
 So, Brian. Do you wanna know how I did all this?

Brian:
 I really do.

George:
 I got neutered.

Brian:
 [winces in discomfort] But why?

George:
 Getting neutered eliminated all distractions and allowed me to focus solely on my work. Sometimes you have to literally cut out the things that hold you back.

Brian:
 I love that book, Charles Dickens by David Copperfield. Writing was his real magic.

Peter:
 I just don't understand. One minute I got a hot ginger wife and the next, I'm married to Ron Weasley.

Cleveland:
 Donna wears a wig so I've never even seen her real hair but I would imagine it looks like an old faded sweater that needs to be depilled.

Peter:
 The punchline is it was 9/11.

Brian:
 I'm gonna write an inspirational book about my life and I'm calling it The Holy Brible.

Stewie:
 Please don't.

Brian:
 I've always believed I was destined for a life like yours but something was holding me back. Now I realize, it was two things.

Stewie:
 Brian, are you sure about getting neutered?

Brian:
 I am. You've seen everything George Townsend's accomplished. That's the life I've always dreamed of.

Stewie:
 Yes, but how much do you really know about him? Have you read his books?

Brian:
 Course I've read his books. They changed my life. Look, Stewie. This is a huge step for me and if you can't support me, well then maybe I should cut you out of my life too.

Stewie:
 Brian, that's a closet.

Brian:
 [offscreen] I know. I have stuff to do in here.

Bentley:
 Hey. You want a half of my sandwich?

Peter:
 Oh. Yeah, very cool Bentley. Who made this?

Bentley:
 My wife.

Peter:
 Oh, you...your wife with AIDS?

Bentley:
 She doesn't have AIDS! She did a walk for people with AIDS!

Peter:
 But presumably there were people with AIDS at the walk?

Bentley:
 Yeah but you can't get...

Peter:
 That's a no on the sandwich, Bentley.

Peter:
 I'm gonna make one political donation with your email address, so you'll be screwed for life!

Lois:
 I'm going to rededicate my life to Christ.

Peter:
 Oh, that's really bad!

George:
 You abandoned me. You promised we'd be there for each other forever. Then the minute Peter Griffin came along, you just got in his car and left me.

Brian:
 I was gonna come back and get you and...and then...and then Trump happened and...and...all that.

Brian:
 Brian: How did you know what he was doing?

Stewie:
 I read his book. [Reads an excerpt] "There is no greater motivation than the destruction of an enemy, and my enemy is Brian Griffin. One day, I will convince him to cut off his own balls, and that will be my greatest accomplishment." You said his books changed your life, but you didn't even read them. This is why you're nothing.

Meg:
 So, anyone wanna ask me about my week?...Kind of a big week for the Megster...Big envelope in the mail...Yep, early admittance...Day 1, August 26th. Clean slate.

Peter:
 Closing credits.

Joe:
 [offscreen] CONGRATULATIONS ON BOWDOIN MEG!

Peter:
 Closing credits!

Cleveland:
 You were in Seinfeld?

Joe:
 Yeah, that's right.

Peter:
 Don't pop that. You'll throw up.

Chris:
 Hey, dad. What do you got there?

Peter:
 Chris, I got us lobsters for dinner.

Chris:
 Cool! Can...Can I kill them?

Peter:
 Hmmm, let me think...Of course you can kill them, sport!

Chris:
 YAAAAAY!

Chris:
 Stop! You're killing him!

Lobster:
 [sarcastic] No, that's just air escaping. They can't feel anything.

Peter:
 I'm surprised this thing still works after the day we had...meaning I had sex with it.

Chris:
 I know!

Lois:
 We get it!

Meg:
 Ew!

Stewie:
 Five minutes ago, I had that flashlight under my chin to look scary.

Peter:
 Where'd you learn Klingon?

Lois:
 A couple of girls who do my nails are Klingons and I just had to know if they were talking about me.

Peter:
 Oh, word?

Lois:
 I found your account online. Monday night, you said you were working late but there's a $62 charge at the clam.

Peter:
 So, whoever stole my card is still in town.

Peter:
 We heard someone had a birthday.

Birthday Singers:
 H [claps] A [claps] P [claps] P [claps] ...

Birthday Singers:
 [claps] T [claps] E! Happy birthday, Charlotte!

Guy:
 Excuse me, my table is celebrating the birthday of deceased Hawaiin pop singer, Israel Kamakawiwo'ole.

Peter:
 Look, our internet connection.

Chris:
 [offscren] Mom!

Chris:
 [offscreen] Nevermind.

Chris:
 [offscreen] Mom!

Cleveland:
 [offscreen] Donna!

Joe:
 [offscreen] Bonnie!

Quagmire:
 [offscreen] I'm not on the internet. Some people in this neighborhood read.

Cleveland:
 Anyway, it was a beautiful ceremony. We laid my Uncle Reggie to rest with the respect that he deserved.

Cleveland:
 AH! Uncle Reggie! I'm sorry we stuffed you in that Hefty Cinch Sack and pushed you in the pond!

Stewie:
 What is it? What is it boy?

Brian:
 [barks]

Stewie:
 The fat man dug a tunnel to go hang out with Cleveland, Joe, and Quagmire? We've gotta tell someone!

Lois:
 What is it, Stewie?

Stewie:
 WHAAAAAA! WHAAAAA!

Lois:
 Daddy went to a Peter Cetera concert in Cleveland with Robin Tunney?

Chris:
 Robin Tunney from The Mentalist slept with the entire Cleveland Browns team?

Meg:
 Bad Moms 1 and 2 are available on most streaming platforms?

Peter:
 Don't ... Don't do that, Mila. Not on this show.

Lois:
 Peter, I don't want to have to ground you. You're my husband and I just don't want you to lie to me.

Peter:
 I lie to you 'cause you treat me like a kid.

Lois:
 Act like a man and I'll stop treating you like a kid.

Chris:
 I'm about to take my laptop into the bathroom. I ask that you please respect my privacy in this difficult time. Thank you.

Quagmire:
 Anyone else having trouble breathing?

Peter:
 Could just be allergies.

Quagmire:
 [angry] Yeah. Yeah, you think it's allergies? You don't think it's because we're running out of air!?

Peter:
 It's hard to say. I don't know how severe your allergies are. Different people are allergic.

Quagmire:
 [angry] You are such a moron! You know, I hope we do die down here.

Peter:
 [sarcastic] Oh, that's nice.

Quagmire:
 [angry] So I never have to listen to another word out of your mouth!

Peter:
 [sarcastic] That's a nice thing to say to a lifelong friend.

Peter:
 Ahhhh. Ahhh.

Quagmire:
 I'm gonna kill you, Peter!

Cleveland:
 So if we're all gonna die anyway, what's the worst thing you guys have ever done?

Peter:
 Okay, I'll go first. Lois once killed a woman.

Quagmire:
 Seems like a secret about Lois.

Peter:
 Yeah but I picked out the woman.

Peter:
 Probably just the movie in the next theater.

Tom:
 So, Chris. You happy to have your dad back?

Chris:
 Yeah, you know what, Tom? I think we're all gonna go home and charge out laptops a little longer tonight. Just never know when you're gonna run out of juice and have to use your phone.

Tom:
 [tears up] You know, just because we're reporters doesn't mean we're devoid of emotion. Go on and head home with your family.

Chris:
 Thanks, Tom.

Tom:
 [wipes away tears] That's a...That's a very horny kid right there.

Waitress:
 I'm sorry, sir. The chef said he can't make a chocolate chip gumball pizza.

Peter:
 Oh-ho. That's okay. It's not your fault. I'll just need another minute then.

Peter:
 [grimly] Her.

Lois:
 I'm on it. I love you so much.

Shape Shifting Valet:
 Sir, you need to get ready for your lifetime achievement award ceremony.

Stewie:
 Thank you, shape shifting valet.

Shape Shifting Valet:
 Remember sir, I can be any shape you wish.

Lane Bergen:
 Welcome ladies and gentlemen and 14 other genders we have now.

Lane Bergen:
 I'm Lane Bergen. The biggest star of May 2020 and on. So, if you've only watched TV up until April of 2020, my name would be unfamiliar to you.

Stewie:
 Lane Bergen? What did Brett Kingston say no?

Stewie:
 I invented a pill to extend your life. It's called Semper Fido.

Stewie:
 I wanted you to live long enough to see that global warming is complete bullcrap.

Brian:
 Oh my God. We were so wrong about that.

Stewie:
 I guess I'm just not a family guy.

Chris:
 I kind of wasted my life except I obsessed over teaching my penis how to talk.

 Penis:
 Who's out there?

Chris:
 Settle down. I just got some company.

 Penis:
 Well, aren't you going to introduce me?

Chris:
 I'm getting to that. If you'll give me a second.

 Penis:
 I wanna have a look at them.

Chris:
 Hey, numbskull. That's how we got in trouble the last time.

Meg:
 Oh YEAH! [vomits]

Meg:
 This one could use another layer.

Meg:
 Hi, Chris' penis. How are you?

 Penis:
 Same spit, different day.

Weenie and the Butt Singers:
 Quahog 97 FM on the radio and the internet and the orb, a new invention which lets you hear stuff in your head without a device.

Cleveland:
 I'm starting to think my call is not important to them.

Recorded Voice:
 Your call is important to us. Thank you for remaining on the line.

Cleveland:
 Alright. You just bought yourself another year.

Stewie:
 Look at all this traffic.

Chris:
 Yeah, Brady Boulevard is tight this time of day. You know what? Cut over to Brady on Brady and then take the Brady bridge.

Stewie:
 Is everything in this town named after Tom Brady?

Quagmire:
 You know what's cool? Ice cream! Wanna go get a cup? Cone? Bowl?

Stewie:
 I'm just trying to see my folks.

Quagmire:
 Man, I love ice cream. You know there's three different ice cream shops in Quahog. They're all good.

Stewie:
 What's your favorite?

Quagmire:
 They're all good. [nods] So, that's the scoop from here.

Lois:
 Your father's had severe diabetes ever since they opened three ice cream stores in town.

Peter:
 They're all good.

Tom:
 Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker. Delivering the news with my Andy Rooney, end of life eyebrows. You won't hear anything I'm saying because they're so distracting.

Peter:
 Aw, thanks for these virtual reality glasses, so I can watch porn while talking to the family. So, what's California like, Stewie? [disgusted] Aaaaah! That was a penis.

Stewie:
 So,...you...still want to know about California?

Peter:
 No, I'm done.

Lois:
 Oh, Dr. Hartman, thank you for coming.

 Hartmanson:
 Well, actually I'm Dr. Hartman's son.

Peter:
 Dr. Hartmanson? But I asked for Dr. Hartman.

Peter:
 I see a white light. There are others inside of it. Adam West, Carrie Fisher, Ricardo Montalban, Phyllis Diller, ...

Brian:
 Heaven is filled with every actor who ever died?

Peter:
 No, this is actually just the ones who did our show right before they died. Crazy right? Frank Sinatra, Jr., Charles Durning, Lauren Bacall, Rodney Dangerfield, Roy Scheider, Waylon Jennings, Ed Asner by the time this airs, certainly.

Chris:
 Dad, you don't have to do this. There are too many.

Lois:
 He's trying to say something. His final words.

Peter:
 Lactating pregnant Latinas.

Chris:
 I will, dad. I promise.

Chris:
 I feel like we're in The Sting. That movie from 100 years ago about 150 years ago.

Meg:
 Great work, tricking him, Brian.

Brian:
 Thanks. Well, you know I credit my years as a writer. When I planned the con, I saw Quahog as a character...

Lois:
 Okay, that's enough.

Brian:
 Stewie help! It hurts! Reverse the pill! Let me die!

Stewie:
 Oooh, I wish I could but the pills were in the house. Soooo,...yeah.

Brian:
 Stewie! Stewie!

Stewie:
 Huh? What?

Brian:
 What the hell is wrong with you? You've been staring at that old man Halloween costume for 30 minutes!

Stewie:
 Well, 21 plus commercials, but it's a big decision.

Meg:
 People of Argentina. I have heard you cries and I just want to say...

Peter:
 Meg! Meg! I already told you, you're not gonna be Evita. You're gonna be the back half of Edgar the farting horse.

Chris:
 Meg's estrogen suppliments?

Joe:
 Yeah. Handicapped person at the ballpark. Ramps, private escort, meet the team.

Guy:
 [offscreen] Is there a Joe Swanson?

Peter:
 Meet me at that sad balcony.

Peter:
 Just FYI, I'm either gonna finish too quick or not at all.

Peter:
 Alright, little bingo. Let's go. Little bingo here. Not a lot of bingo. Don't wanna play bingo for a long time. Short game of bingo. Don't even have to play a little bingo. Could play a little banjo.

Peter:
 Ducks on the pond guys. Ducks on the pond. Chewing up bits of bread. Pooping in the pond. Ducks on the pond. Something brown, something pretty, all of them ducks. Ducks on the pond.

Peter:
 I'm a baseball coach now. You knew that when you married me.

Peter:
 Hey, thanks for coming. Take a seat.

Meg:
 What's up?

Peter:
 [sigh] This is really the toughest part of the business, isn't it?

Meg:
 Oh my God. Are you trading me?

Peter:
 Looks, it's nothing personal. You've been very professional as a family member but ... here's the thing. We're sending you down to American Dad!.

Meg:
 No! What? No!

Peter:
 Well, they're not excited about it either. I guess I could call The Orville.

Meg:
 [sigh] I'll do American Dad!.

Peter:
 Way to go, you. All this is happening because you did something well.

Peter:
 Alright, bring us home, kid. Bring us home. Little bingo. Ducks on the pond. Furry ducks. Little man on the boat. If you can find it, you're a better man than I am.

Tom:
 Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker, joined tonight by a very special guest, Channel 5's own Tom Tucker, Sr., who hasn't been on the air since 1964. Take it away, dad.

Tom:
 And that's a wrap for Tom, Sr.

Peter:
 Well, just finished a load. Gonna go the laundry next.

Chris:
 I can't believe my dad's a hero.

Peter:
 Oh, I'm no hero. I'm just a white guy doing what black people were already doing. In other words, a hero.

Brian:
 I'm no different than my peers. Rosa Parks, Nelson Mandella, Dr. Martin Luther King, hey did you ever notice he has the names "Doc" and "Marty" in his name?

Stewie:
 Let it go.

Brian:
 Hello, Twitter.

Brian:
 And I have to move out again.

TV Announcer:
 We now return to Seinfeld, which keeps getting edited down more and more for syndication.

Soup Nazi:
 NO SOUP FOR-

Peter:
 Funny show.

Lois:
 Peter, what the Hell!?

Peter:
 It's okay. It's okay ... I voted.

Lois:
 You know what? This while activism thing has gone on long enough. You knelt at one game. It's not like opportunity's gonna come knocking at the door, offering you money for it.

Guy:
 Hi, I'm the president of Nike. How would you like some money?

Lois:
 [offscreen] FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!

Peter:
 I voted.

Peter:
 [narrating a Nike commercial] How do you know what's inside of you unless you test yourself? Don't do one pushup. Do one hundred. Don't run one mile. Run a marathon. Don't have one family. Have a second family all the way across the country. Don't just have a second family. Have a third family in Santa Fe with an alternative lifestyle. Don't spend any time with the first two families. Make a commitment to family number three. Double down by announcing it at his war hero father's retirement party. Don't go to the funeral cuz remember, you've got two other families to deal with and a marathon to train for. Don't let Kenneth walk out of your life. Take his life from him. Don't just go to jail. Go to death row by killing the two other families. Don't just let anyone have their closure by apologizing. Send a message that you're not afraid of Hell.

Carter:
 Peter, ever since you made that stupid commercial, my ticket sales have tanked. Thanks to you, people now think The Quahog Whooping Scalpers are racist.

Carter:
 Oh, Disney's not gonna like that.

Cleveland:
 Welcome to Waquahog.

Peter:
 Oh my God. Why wasn't this The Cleveland Show?

Cleveland:
 This entire episode would have been our season five premiere.

Peter:
 Better give him a big tip.

Cleveland:
 Pretty sure the tip is already built into the service charge.

Leader of Waquahog:
 Now LeBron's a Laker.

Cleveland:
 A Laker's now LeBron.

Peter:
 Yeah, that's not really working out.

Carter:
 Hey, what do you say we take a pit stop in the little boy's room?

Peter:
 Carter, I know you're just trying to honor the troops.

Carter:
 I never said that.

Guy:
 [offscreen] Why's your phone all pink and sparkly?

Peter:
 You're talking about it, aren't you?

Guy:
 [offscreen] Oh, snap!

Peter:
 I'm making my way to the bathroom. I have to poop again.

Meg:
 [singing] Good morning, USA! Ba da ba da ba Stan's the dad and the alien's gay! And then there's a fish and a boy and a girl!

Stan:
 Hey! Shut up Meg!

Meg:
 Oh. So it's just going to be the same?

Stan:
 Yep.

Roger:
 Yeah.

Peter:
 Quagmire, excuse my Wisconsin mouth but [in a Wisconsin accent] why the heck are you not drinking for cripes sake?

Quagmire:
 I'm on medication so I can't drink, okay? And I'm not gonna say what it's for I'll ..I'll just say the pharmacist whispers it to me.

Peter:
 Cleveland, I could kiss you!

Cleveland:
 My heart says yes but my lord says no.

Peter:
 Will there be fractions? I was told there would be no fractions.

Escape Room Guy:
 Well, whoever told you that was half right.

Joe:
 Well, I don't know if we should be betting. Our family kind of has an unfair advantage, I mean,...I'm a detective.

Bonnie:
 No.

Joe:
 Kay.

Meg:
 Hey, Chris. You want an edible?

Chris:
 [shocked] MEG!...[happy] Yes!

Lois:
 Where do people leave their keys, when they come into a room?

Meg:
 [high] In the coat on the coat rack.

Chris:
 STRENGTH OVER BRAINS!

Cleveland:
 Everything on Groupon is just a trick to Get Out black people.

Stewie:
 The answer is obvious.

Brian:
 I know, totally ...

Stewie:
 ... Oh. Oh, you're waiting for me to keep going.

Bozo the Tax Accountant:
 Well, the good news is, since you do a sex advice podcast, which I really like, by the way, every time you [honks horn] it's a write-off.

Woman:
 Really?

Bozo the Tax Accountant:
 Oh, yeah and now just [honks horn] also [blows slide whistle] and even [flings jaw harp]

Woman:
 Are you kidding me?

Bozo the Tax Accountant:
 [pies himself in the face] Do I look like I'm kidding?

Chris:
 Mom! Dad! Brian's talking crap about you guys to Stewie.

Brian:
 What!? No I wasn't!

Meg:
 Yeah, he was. He said we were a bunch of basic bitches. It's kind of true, yo.

Peter:
 Are umpires not cool? I'm starting to feel foolish.

Waiter:
 That man over there, reading a book by himself has offered to pay for your meal if you move to a table outside.

Quagmire:
 [to himself] You're not the dick in this situation. You're paying for their meal so you can't be the dick.

Lois:
 Brian, I need your help with Stewie on the plane.

Brian:
 Sure, no problem.

Lois:
 The iPad's broken.

Brian:
 FUCK!

Stewie:
 [offscreen] Poo poo!

Brian:
 [offscreen] No! We do not touch poo poo in this family! We do not touch poo poo! No! Hands up! That's it. Now there's no bubbles later.

Stewie:
 [offscreen] Yes! Bubbles!

Brian:
 [offscreen] No bubbles. You lost the bubbles.

Brian:
 [offscreen] Maybe you can earn them back but as far as I'm concerned, you lost the bubbles. They're gone. They're probably gone.

Brian:
 [angry] WHAT!?

Stewie:
 Stewie-chu!

Stewie:
 Brian! You did it!

Brian:
 OH, SHIT SORRY! SHIT!

Chris:
 You don't wanna be in here, dude.

Asian Guy:
 STEWIE!

Brian:
 Wish me luck, Flat Stanley.

Stewie:
 By traveling back here, you've created a new timeline. For everything to revert back to normal, you have to drown your past self in the toilet.

Brian:
 Hey, Stewie.

Stewie:
 [alarmed] Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! No! No! Sorry! Sorry! I have it backwards!

Stewie:
 You're supposed to be drowning your future self. You came back. You're the new timeline.

Stewie:
 Hey, I said I'm smart. I'm not perfect.

Brian:
 Do it! Just do it!

Stewie:
 ... Eh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this is right.

Stewie:
 Well, that was fun but it didn't fill the whole episode, so in the Pixar tradition of killing time, here's a Family Guy short and don't worry, it won't be that creepy one where the Chinese mother eats her baby.

Peter:
 Nothing like drive time radio to remind me that I don't make enough to afford satellite radio.

Weenie:
 Hey hey! You're listening to WQHG 97.1 and we are Devin and Lawrence formerly known as Weenie and the Butt.

The Butt:
 That's right, Devin. Those nicknames no longer fly ever since several women came forth with allegations of sexual misconduct against each of us.

Weenie:
 And don't forget, Quahog is expected to experience record high temperatures this week, according to our respected meteorologist, Dr. Jessica Sturgeous, formerly known as Weather Girl Aooga Knockerson.

Stewie:
 I'm going to watch the older boys play Fortnite because I'm not old enough to play Fortnite, myself.

Electronics Store Cashier:
 Manager, who's dishearteningly younger than me, to the service counter, please.

Baby:
 This better not be another over ring. Corporate's gonna have my ass.

Lois:
 Well, we can probably throw out this sunflower butter now that Stewie's classmate with the peanut allergy died.

Peter:
 Steady...You can do this. All you gotta do is remember the song you learned in bomb school. [singing] Green is good and green is good and red is good and yellow is good and clip whatever you want.

Teacher:
 Now, who can tell me what he did wrong?

Student:
 He made up a song about cutting wires?

Teacher:
 He made up a song about cutting wires. Don't do that, guys.

Judge:
 Mr. Griffin, you may proceed.

Peter:
 May it please the court, your honor, opposing counsel, members of the jury, Madame Stenographer, Bailiff Clarence, Snack Cart Steve, elderly widows with paper fans, woman in the third row with a flower hat, Deputy Fife, Boo Radley, Yay Radley, Herman Munster Judge, lazy dog who wandered in due to the heat, crazed Al Pacino, old Robert Duvall, young Robert Duvall, in between Robert Duvall, the books of John Grisham, the defense rests.

Brian:
 We'll set up a kickstarter for the three grand we need.

Stewie:
 But Brian, people don't just donate money on kickstarter. It has to go toward some sort of project.

Brian:
 Okay, then we'll say we're making a movie.

Stewie:
 [dressed as a director] And who will we get to direct?

Peter:
 Hey, what time is our meeting, Oscar?

Oscar:
 It's, [slips in Peter's sweat] AAAAAAH!!!

Peter:
 Sorry. What time is our meeting, AAAAAHscar?

Bert:
 Dammit, Griffin. You've become a liability in this office!

Peter:
 Why? Cuz I'm drunk and have a gun?

Meg:
 So, dad. Are you excited for your first day of working from home?

Peter:
 Yes, but I'm very late. Busy dad morning goodbyes.

Peter:
 Forgot my phone.

Lois:
 Being a housewife is a full-time job for some pretty tough bosses. [laughs]

Chris:
 [ah-ah-hem] Hi. So, is this your break time?

Lois:
 No, sir.

Chris:
 Oh, okay, I was wondering if my watch was off. Maybe?

Lois:
 It's not.

Chris:
 You see, mom. We try to stay focused on the task at hand here at Griffin Griffin Griffin Griffin and Griffin.

Meg:
 Good morning, Griffin Griffin Griffin and Griffin.

Chris:
 Huh. I thought our letterhead had five Griffins on it, Meg but you were right to leave one of them off...because you're fucking fired.

Lois:
 Morning handsome. [kisses Peter]

Barbara:
 Now, Lois. You have been accused of an unwanted touching.

Lois:
 When?

Barbara:
 Just now. Just before the flip.

Lois:
 Uh, this is ridiculous!

Barbara:
 Lois, please. Now the way this works is we simply gather information and I make up my mind an hour ago. Peter, please tell us what happened.

Peter:
 I'm sitting there at my desk, trying to watch porn on sites you guys haven't figured out yet, and [cries] she comes in and kisses me! [sobs]

Super HR Lady:
 Now, Barbara. The reason you are here at Super HR is there's been an accusation of unwanted touching in an overly sexualized work environment.

Brian:
 Stewie, what's the matter?

Stewie:
 Our kickstarter!

Brian:
 What? Did we not hit our goal?

Chris:
 I also want to ask a question without looking at the screen?

Super HR Lady:
 Okay, I have been made aware of the allegations. Is there anything you can say on your behalf?

Stewie:
 I'm trans?

Super HR Lady:
 You just won HR.

Peter:
 Come on, Peter. Focus. You can do this...and send!

Bert:
 Alright, let's see what Griffin's been up to.

Bert:
 Hmph. I've been saying that to corporate for years.

Stewie:
 We made a film, guys,

Chris:
 And we even had $300,000 leftover to buy snacks.

Cleveland:
 I only read four books in my life and three of them were about Johnny Bench.

Lois:
 Starting tomorrow, you are reading one of these books.

Peter:
 Little Women, Holes, The Giver. These are all porn categories. Black Beauty? Is there anything here that's not pornography?

Lois:
 1984! Just read 1984.

Peter:
 You guys have 1984?

Joanna:
 We've got it on CD. CD. Ha! Sounds like my high school report card.

Peter:
 This is books!? Books kick ass!

Meg:
 It's crazy like JFK deciding to cruise through Dallas in a rental.

Car Dealer:
 How'd that convertible work out for you?

Secret Service:
 Yeah, I don't...I don't know. Good...Okay.

Car Dealer:
 And did you get all your stuff out of the car?

Secret Service:
 ...Kind of?

Officer Stickbutt:
 Dammit!

Joe:
 What? what happened?

Officer Stickbutt:
 Get off this channel, Joe!

Joe:
 What? I wanna be an outside cop!

 Gravitas:
 It's very important that you speak to Peter. He can hear you. Talk about the good times. What he means to you. Talk and keep talking.

Lois:
 Let's just turn on the TV.

Homer:
 Meme.

Peter:
 Not a meme.

Peter:
 The Godfather insists upon itself.

Joe:
 Hey,...if this goes south,...is there a plan for Peter's rakes?...Who's just get Peter's rake?

Chris:
 What did I tell you, mom? What did I tell you?

Joe:
 What? I thought it'd just be one less thing to worry about Peter.

Cleveland:
 You came out of the blocks too soon, Joe.

Bonnie:
 Oh, Lois. I came as soon as I heard. So, have you guys made any arrangements, rake wise?

Joe:
 Bonnie. Ixnay on the Akesray?

 Gravitas:
 No! That's the good sound!

 Hartman:
 Oh, why don't you just do everything!? [leaves in a huff] I hate this stupid hospital.

Peter:
 Wasn't a true story, right?

Jose:
 What?

Peter:
 Coco.

Jose:
 No, it was fictional. Somebody make it up out of their head.

Peter:
 Mayor West? Angela? My dad? Quagmire's fat girlfriend who died in the Clue episode?

 Hartman:
 Mrs. Griffin, I have some good news or some bad news, depending on how you feel about your husband.

Peter:
 Hey, before I go. What's the boat's wi-fi password?

Jose:
 Oh, there's no wi-fi on board.

Peter:
 [horrified] I DON'T WANNA GO!!!

Peter:
 I'm alive!

Mortgage Guy:
 I'm from the mortgage company. Mr. Griffin, you're three months late on your payment.

Peter:
 [pretends to be dead] Beeeeeeeep.

Lois:
 You know what it's like being married to you!? Every day, wondering if my husband's gunna die from something stupid!? Crashing your Petercopter, getting eaten at the zoo, running into a tunnel that's not really a tunnel but just something the Roadrunner painted on the side of a rock!

Peter:
 Yeah, well I saw him go through it!

Fly:
 [singing] And who am I? I'm a fly on the wall. A fly who's seen it all.

Peter:
 Aw, dammit! Now we gotta repaint!

Meg:
 Mom, what is it?

Lois:
 I thought maybe your father would show up at the last second and we'd have one of those airport scenes.

Brian:
 That's a nice movie trope, Lois, but the post-9/11 reality is, there's no way a non-ticketed civilian can-

Peter:
 Lois! Kids!

Chris:
 Dad came! Brian was wrong again!

Peter:
 Maybe that's what a family is, you know? A bunch of people who try to kill each other.

Chris:
 I don't think that's what a family is.

Stewie:
 Eh, it is, kinda.

Peter:
 If I gotta have my plug pulled by somebody, I want it to be you and you're the only people who's plug I wanna pull.

Chris:
 Well, we all learned an important lesson. No one should ever read a book.

Chris:
 Oh my God, you guys! Another space shuttle exploded!

Peter:
 [sigh] Well, there's only one thing to do. Let's paint.

Fly:
 [singing] When shuttles blow up, it's not always an accident.

Stewie:
 What do you mean, not an accident? Who is this guy, singing?

Fly:
 [singing] And who am I? A conspiracy fly. Did you know NASA means "deceive" in Hebrew?

Peter:
 I did not.

Peter:
 Okay, Meg. If this is you. What's your birthday?

Meg:
 The usual please.

Bruce:
 Here you are. Ladies 7 on the left and men's 11 on the right.

Bruce:
 Ooooh and happy birthday!

Bruce:
 We have not updated those.

Joe:
 Peter, Lois, it pains me above the waist to tell you that Meg is dead.

Lois:
 What!?

Peter:
 What are you talking about? Meg's right here!

Peter:
 You know, it's weird that didn't happen on the pier all day.

Chris:
 Or when we rented that convertible.

Tom:
 156 pounds, yikes!

Meg:
 Wait, did you give my ID to the wrong girl?

Bruce:
 Sorry, them shoe spray fumes made me all goofy in my head. [inhales shoe spray] I still sober. This ain't cheatin'. Oh, this is me being sober!

Tom:
 Again, for those of you in a new scene, Meg Griffin dead.

Peter:
 Lois, can you believe these seats? Front row!

Principal Shepherd:
 Meg Griffin was an honest man. A kind man. A man who knew how ...

Principal Shepherd:
 Oh my stars! I have nothing.

Brian:
 I feel bad. There's nobody here.

Stewie:
 I know. We're not even here.

Stewie:
 This was the right decision.

Meg:
 Ooh, sorry.

Priest:
 Don't you know what a rosary on a doorknob means!?

Lois:
 Before we eat. Would anyone like to say something about Meg?

Brian:
 Okay, I feel all of you looking at me, so here goes. Meg, wherever you are, I hope that you're with Bubba. I want you to know that Lieutenant Dan is walking around ...

Stewie:
 Is this from Forrest Gump?

Not Important:
 Hi, new neighbor. I just thought I'd come by and see if I could borrow a cup of tampons.

Meg:
 Sure. Just bring them back when you're done. No rush.

Meg:
 My name is...[sees a hallway]...Hallway. Natalee Hallway.

Meg:
 YOOOOOOW! What a view!

Girl:
 Wow, Natalee Hallway. When did you get so good at bowling?

Meg:
 Oh, I used to play a lot back in Qua...rea.

Girl:
 Wow. You lived in Korea?

Meg:
 Yep, when I was with the embassy.

Other Girl:
 So, was that before or after you were one of the first black women to do math for NASA?

Boy:
 Hey, Griffin. I heard you scored with the girls' basketball team, yesterday.

Chris:
 Yup. 12 points and 8 rebounds.

Chris:
 ALIVE!?

Meg:
 Chris, you already know that part.

Principal Shepherd:
 Good morning students, we are gathered here for two reasons today. One, to mourn the loss of Meg Griffin and two, to find the owner of this X-Men water bottle someone left in wood shop. Does anyone recognize it?

Student:
 I'll take it.

Principal Shepherd:
 That's not what I asked.

Stewie:
 This gym is sad. If you haven't won a championship since 1982, just take the banner down.

Meg:
 I'm not in any of these! Oh, come on! I was in the Kingsman fight! That could have been in there. I can do stuff. I...I can be part of a comedy team. Look. [talking to herself] Hey, Chris. Who's on first? A baseball player! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

Principal Shepherd:
 I think we can all agree that John is entitled to take whichever student he wishes home with him tonight.

Principal Shepherd:
 The Quiznos across the street has graciously taken out a full-page ad in the yearbook that will feature a dedication page to Meg.

Lois:
 Oh my God, Meg! I'm so glad you're alive! What happened?

Meg:
 He did this! [points to Chris]

Principal Shepherd:
 Are you saying Chris saved your life?

Principal Shepherd:
 This calls for a celebration! Alright, everyone, throw confetti and ruin the janitor's weekend!

Chris:
 I owe my sister an apology. I shouldn't have treated her the way I did and I think if Meg were here today, she'd be the first one to agree.

Meg:
 I AM HERE! I'M RIGHT HERE!

Chris:
 Anyway Meg, wherever you are, I'm sorry.

Brian:
 I'm just really glad this whole ordeal is over.

Stewie:
 [over the walkie-talkie] Glad this whole ordeal is what? Over.

Meg:
 COME ON!

Lois:
 Women fake a lot of things. You fake your death. I fake orgasms and being impressed by my husband's accomplishments at work.

Peter:
 Hey, Lois. Guess who got to erase the whiteboard in a meeting today?

Lois:
 Oh my! I think someone's earned himself Mama Lois' famous egg salad! Huh?

Peter:
 Oh yum! Oh, today just keeps getting better and better.

Chris:
 Dad, I thought you hated mom's egg salad.

Peter:
 Chris, part of being a man is faking things like faking things and pretending to like your mom's egg salad.

Brian:
 Guys?...Guys!?

Peter:
 A book called "t" written by Holly Bibble.

Chris:
 "Uh, Peter. I think that's the Holy Bible" is what Brian would say if he wasn't drowning in our backyard.

Meg:
 When he's gone, can we get a bird?

Lois:
 [referring to The Bible] It's Harry Potter for stupid people.

Stewie:
 Hey, guys. Could you tone it down? This is offensive to the open button shirt necklace community.

Adam:
 I think the leaf over my balls is poison ivy.

Adam:
 That green leafy thing, that's a Kasey. That thing flying through the sky, there, Kasey.

Eve:
 You can't name everything "Kasey".

Adam:
 Alright, fine Eve. What's the word for that thing flying through the sky?

Eve:
 I don't know, a bird.

Adam:
 Oh, bird? Bird is the word?

God:
 Well, I gotta go get yelled at for being late to something I didn't wanna go to in the first place.

Eve:
 Adam, would you like a pear?

Adam:
 Apple.

Eve:
 Orange?

Eve:
 Grape?

Eve:
 Peach?

Eve:
 Nectarine?

Adam:
 Kasey.

Eve:
 Cantaloupe?

Eve:
 Honeydew?

Eve:
 Clementine?

Serpent:
 Hey, you guys looking for some apples?

Adam:
 You know, I could go for an apple.

Eve:
 If we eat the apple, we're kicked out of paradise.

Serpent:
 They have antioxidants.

Eve:
 They do?

Serpent:
 Why would I lie? I'm a snake in a tree. I have nothing to gain from lying to you, aside from the minor sexual thrill of watching someone eat something and...and that's minor.

Lois:
 They populated the Earth.

Meg:
 How?

Lois:
 They had kids.

Meg:
 Okay but then what did they do?

Lois:
 They had kids too.

Meg:
 With who?

Lois:
 They were fruitful.

Peter:
 Well, the girls, with either their brothers or their fathers and the boys with either their sisters or their mothers.

God:
 Noah, I want you to build an ark.

Noah:
 Riiiiight...What's an ark?

God:
 A large ship. 40 cubits by 80 cubits by 40 cubits.

Noah:
 Riiiiight...What's a cubit?

Lois:
 Wait a minute, are you just doing Bill Cosby bits?

Peter:
 Well, why not? All of his stuff is up for grabs. What is he gonna do, sue us?

Naamah:
 Now, it's time to get ready for school.

Ham:
 There's no school today. There was another mass stoning.

Naamah:
 Oh, another school stoning. When will we learn? If only those teachers had stones, then they could stone back.

Shem:
 Hello? Stone control?

Naamah:
 Shem, stones don't kill people. People kill people...with stones.

Ham:
 I don't think the founding fathers ever envisioned stones this large.

Noah:
 Can we not politicize the stoning? Alright? Thought and prayers. Thoughts and prayers for the bashed.

Biblical Cleveland:
 No no no no NOAH!

Noah:
 Alright, uh lions, you'll be with the baby antelopes. Uh, Crocodiles, you're with the water crossing wildebeests. Uh, bats, you'll be with bugs. Seagulls and McDonald's wrappers, pitbulls and city babies, and Christian Bale and annoying cameramen.

Annoying Cameraman:
 Hey, Christian. Looks like I'm rooming with you.

Christian Bale:
 OH, GOOD FOR YOU!

Shem:
 SOMEBODY THROW AWAY THE BALLED UP UNDERWEAR IN MY ROOM! DON'T LOOK AT IT JUST THROW IT AWAY!

Chris:
 [thought] God, if you stop this rain, I promise I'll never do butt stuff.

Peter:
 [thought] God, if you stop this rain, I promise I'll never do butt stuff again.

Stewie:
 [thought] Let it pour.

Jesus:
 Hey, hey, Mary. That half orange, half red one is mine so don't eat it. I wanna have it for when we watch The Sound of Music on Sunday.

Mary:
 We don't have to wait 'til Sunday. We can eat these eggs tonight.

Jesus:
 Oh, sorry. I got that big supper with the guys tonight but tomorrow's Friday. Date night. You and me. Nothing's keeping me from that. Somebody would have to nail me to a piece of wood and throw me in a cave grave.

Pontius:
 Grace? Grace, am I done? Can I go home?

Grace:
 Oh, not yet. You still have that meeting with that Judas Iscariot, regarding that Jesus fella.

Pontius:
 Ugh, right, Jesus. Man that guy's a pain in the ass.

Grace:
 Oh, well he's very popular. The lepers, the Canaanites, the fishermen, the Philippians, that woman at the well. Oh, they all love him. They think he's a righteous dude.

Jesus:
 Uh, Yes. That's us.

Waitress:
 Ed Christ?

Jesus:
 Uh, no. No, Jesus Christ.

Ed:
 I'm Ed Christ.

Waitress:
 Great, is your whole party here?

Ed:
 Almost. My wife, Stephanie is out pooping on some hay but she is here.

Jesus:
 Let's all sit on the same side of the table.

Waitress:
 Can I start you folks off with anything to drink?

Jesus:
 Yes, we'll all be splitting one cup of wine and can we have some bread and no other food at all?

Jesus:
 Before the night is over, one of you will betray me.

Cleveland:
 This is some bull crap. I'm the only one who's the color we're supposed to be in this thing.

Jesus:
 Okay, good. Here's the bread. Now everybody listen up. Take this and eat it. It's supposed to be...like, my body.

Quagmire:
 Ew, what part?

Jesus:
 I'm not gonna say what part but you're supposed to eat it, while kneeling.

Jesus:
 Aw, son of a bitch! Alright, forget it. You know what? This whole thing is ruined! Okay? We'll just do it next week. I mean it's not like this is our last supper.

Brian:
 I was left to die.

Stewie:
 Oh, boy. Brian's upset because someone has something he doesn't. You know what I'm getting you for your birthday? The ability to be happy for other people.

Stewie:
 Brian, I'd love to stay and talk but Bugs Bunny is about to make this tenor hold a note for far longer than anyone should.

Peter:
 Keith, what's the matter?

Lois:
 It's Chris, you idiot. [to Meg] Mary, what happened?

Lois:
 School should be a safe place, where they get shot sometimes.

Council Lady:
 There's still the agenda item of you fat-shaming Chris Griffin.

Principal Shepherd:
 I think we can table that ... as long as it's a pretty strong table.

Lois:
 This is the year 2020 and nothing is okay. This is the year of instant outrage.

Peter:
 [outraged] WHAT!?

Superintendent:
 If your son had been shot, all I could offer thoughts and prayers but this calls for a far stronger response.

Peter:
 Lois, can I talk to you one step over this way, yet magically out of earshot from him?

Peter:
 The wi-fi is "Joe Swanson Guest".

Principal Shepherd:
 Now, I believe you have some masturbating to do, young man.

Chris:
 I already did it.

Principal Shepherd:
 Chris.

Chris:
 I mean ... I was about to.

Principal Shepherd:
 Atta boy.

Peter:
 Oh, he's a good boy.

Doug:
 I need to borrow a shovel.

Stewie:
 A hole? Where are you going? China?

Doug:
 That's the hope.

Doug:
 Who-hoa, careful! That's how God makes angels!

Principal Shepard:
 [from the intercom which has been moved into the Griffin kitchen] Attention Griffins, could Peter Griffin please report to the backyard?

All:
 Oooooooh!

Peter:
 Shut up!

Meg:
 Allahu Akbaar!

Meg:
 How long is Principal Shepherd gonna keep is in detention down here?

Lois:
 Oh, you got a big date? Is that it? Gotta get out of here for a big date? That what you're saying?

Meg:
 Hey. Bite my butt, mom. At least I'm not a withered old slut like you are.

Chris:
 Oh, just kiss and get it over with.

Meg:
 Alright, we're playing.

Peter:
 No no no! No no no no no! Meg! Meg! Meg!

Peter:
 Alright, who's next?

Chris:
 Checkmate.

Judge:
 Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?

 Foreman:
 We have not, your honor. We all fell we need another night at The Hyatt with free HBO.

Judge:
 That free HBO was just a preview. It ended today.

 Foreman:
 We have a verdict, your honor.

Brian:
 Herf-Derf!

Stewie:
 Fat ankles.

Superintendent:
 I hereby reinstate Principal Shepherd.

Peter:
 Yes! I love you, baby!

Peter:
 Sorry, Lois. I needed you out of the way, so I could kiss this lady.

Publisher:
 I'm sorry. It's not really our brand.

Chris:
 I see. Well, what about Phineas and Ferb erotic fanfiction?

Publisher:
 Now that is interesting. Read it to me, while I eat my soup.

Chris:
 Ferb was having a throbby morning. Phineas was having none of it.

Joe:
 I'm for Karachi but I don't got a death wish about it.

Cleveland:
 I can shake anything and find out what all's in there.

Cleveland:
 You got 11 purriods left.

Peter:
 It's my magic 8 ball. This is the first black ball that Kim Kardashian hasn't played with.

Meg:
 Why's it filled with the blue liquid from tampon commercials?

Peter:
 He told me to do it!

HR Sponsor:
 Mr. Griffin, if a magic 8 ball asked you to jump off a building, would you do that too?

Peter:
 ... Did it?

Peter:
 Magic 8 ball, what's the best Email provider?

Peter:
 Outlook good. Interesting.

Peter:
 My religion is now the 8 ball.

Peter:
 Magic 8 ball, is the FOX Network sustainable in this new streaming world?

Peter:
 No! NO!!!

s Friend:
 Kim, what's wrong?

Kim Kardashian:
 A black ball went to waste.

Stewie:
 I hate this. When do I get my cookie? I just want my cookie so I can go home.

Stewie:
 FUUUUUUUUCK!!!!!!!!

Lois:
 Right now, every woman in my mommy wine group is judging me. I might have to start drinking wine at home, alone!

Chris:
 Start?

Lois:
 NOT THE DAY FOR IT, CHRIS! NOT THE DAY!

Stewie:
 What if that's the only thing I'll ever be able to express? Anger. What kind of a person would I be then?

Brian:
 Larry David, Lewis Black, a Trump voter, everyone on Twitter.

Stewie:
 Ice cream! Lollipop! Bubbles! Kitty cat! Doggy! Raincoat! Preschool! Firetruck! Goldfish! Fingerpaint!

Lois:
 You're saying that because of a swear word, my son isn't good enough for your pool party?

Bonnie:
 It's a little bit about him swearing but mostly about you as a parent.

Bonnie:
 Kevin, I said no arrows!

Kevin:
 [offscreen] Crossbows don't shoot arrows! They shoot bolts, dumbass!

Bonnie:
 [chuckles] Okay, sweetie.

Kevin:
 [offscreen] Hey, dad! Did you hear what Einstein called bolts!?

Joe:
 [offscreen] I heard it.

Caillou:
 Why am I bald? I'm not a baby. I'm four. Are kids just bald in Canada?

Caillou:
 Dad, why are we sitting on the washing machine?

s dad:
 Because in Canada, men have vaginas.

Brian:
 Hey, what's with the stairs? Why do they look different?

Lois:
 Oh, I'm trying to prove that Peter's the one cussing in the house so I waxed the staircase for him to fall down.

Peter:
 [offscreen] Hey, Lois. Have you seen my Spider-Man socks? I can't seem to-[falls down the stairs] Ouch! Oh, Heavens! Oh, goodness gracious! That smarts! Oh, my! Egad! Well, I'll be! Yikes!

Peter:
 I feel like you're wearing what Rachel Maddow would wear to a pumpkin patch.

Lois:
 OW! IT'S THOSE ANTI-BACTERIAL WIPES FOR THE SHOPPING CARTS IT'S BURNING MY EYES! FUUUUUUUUCK!!!!!!

Peter:
 I'm so sorry that happened, Lois...and Lofthouse cookies weren't available at any other grocery store?

Chris:
 Don't worry, dad. I Instacarted some.

Millennial:
 Here's your stuff.

Peter:
 Thank you. Have a good night.

Millennial:
 No.

Peter:
 Everyone's glad your home ... except for mean, older brother Buzz, who never says anything nice. Uh-oh. Here he is now!

Buzz McAllister:
 Hey, Lois...pretty cool you're back.

Peter:
 Ah, I guess he's not such a bad guy after all.

Buzz McAllister:
 Also, America should only accept white immigrants.

Stewie:
 Mommy!

Stewie:
 It's time I got back out there again. I've had one bear my whole life! That's not normal!

Stewie:
 I'm going to do something really nice to Rupert. Show him how much he means to me, Annabelle.

Stewie:
 Oh, no no. No, I don't want you to kill anyone. I'll let you know.

Stewie:
 I'm making a collage for Rupert. We've been firing on all cylinders lately and I just wanted to let him know I care.

Brian:
 That sounds stupid.

Stewie:
 Well, Annabelle doesn't think so. Right, Annabelle?

Peter:
 [offscreen] Holy fuck! What is that!?

Brian:
 Wow, look at all these old photos. Aw, I was such a cute puppy.

Stewie:
 That's not you. That's Snuffles. He got hit by a car.

Stewie:
 Knock knock.

Chris:
 Stewie, can you see who's there?

Chris:
 Someone was knocking at the door.

Stewie:
 It ... It was me I just went "knock knock".

Chris:
 There they are again!

Chris:
 Well, I should get back to my book.

Stewie:
 That's a clock but okay.

Stewie:
 Well, looks like someone was up late.

Chris:
 Yeah, I tend to sleep a little longer, when I'm resting under a big furry bear.

Bruce:
 Oh no! They's doing gay jokes without me!

Bear:
 Shh, it's okay. You're part of it now.

Stewie:
 I heard that on Friends. Did you know they're all 60 now?

Brian:
 Well, I knew Courtney Cox was.

Brian:
 Is Chris wearing a nicotine patch?

Lois:
 Remember when that bear used to be yours, Chris? Oh, you used to take him with you everywhere.

Stewie:
 You shut your mouth, you hear me!? SHUT IT!!!

Chris:
 Just a warning. I had some bad experiences at camp so now I sleep with one eye open.

Stewie:
 'Scuse me, I'm in Bali on a spiritual journey but I seem to have mistakenly wandered into the heavy people beach. Do you happen to know where the thin, attractive beach is?

Stewie:
 Thank you and good luck with whatever's going on with you.

Deepak Chopra Winfrey:
 Everyone check your seats! You get diarrhea, and you get diarrhea, and you get diarrhea! EVERYONE'S GETTING DIARRHEA!!!!!!!!

Stewie:
 Look, I'm afraid I can't let you go, Chris.

Peter:
 [gasps]

Peter:
 I forgot to record Young Sheldon!

Stewie:
 This is exactly how it happened in the movie! How could you say this isn't like Hitchcock?

Chris:
 This is from The Talented Mr. Ripley. It's not a Hitchcock film.

Stewie:
 It's not?

Chris:
 No! It was directed by Anthony Minghella.

Stewie:
 But isn't it a remake?

Chris:
 Of a French film!

Chris:
 I don't think Jordan Peele has the talent we've attributed to him.

 Hartman:
 I think we can get a heart from this kid. [notices Chris is alive] Uhp, nope. He's up.

Peter:
 Some lady up the block is giving away all of her husband's stuff 'cause he shot himself in the face.

Donna:
 [offscreen] Cleveland, It's time for lunch!

Cleveland:
 What do I want? Sammich! When do I want it? Now! I ain't eatin' no Lipton soup!

Lois:
 So kids, Bonnie just told me about the neatest thing. It's called a podcast. I guess it's like a radio show on your phone. Have you heard of these? Podcasts!

Meg:
 Yeah, mom, we know what podcasts are.

Lois:
 Huh. I guess these types of things take a while to reach the moms. I'll have to let Bonnie know.

Bonnie:
 [offscreen] Wow, Really!?

Peter:
 That's right. Since Willem Dafoe has more bones in his face then most people have in their entire body, he's perfect for carving cause the angles are so sharp.

Cleveland:
 Hey, Donna, the tree's just regular.

Donna:
 [offscreen] Go to work, Cleveland!

Stewie:
 Awh, he made a little toot!

Chris:
 That was me. It was one of my cross-legged ones [pauses] I should probably stop recording.

 Hartman:
 Well, if it's your elbow that's bothering you, we should start by checking your reflexes [Dr. Hartman lunges at Peter and screams] AAAH!!!

Peter:
 AAAH!

 Hartman:
 Okay, they seem alright.

Peter:
 Is that the hat?

 Hartman:
 Stupid, right?

Cleveland:
 Whoa! Peter, what happened? Did you tease that witch again?

Peter:
 It's okay, I guess. Although I've noticed I'm a lot more clumsy in the bedroom.

Peter:
 I'm sorry. You two keep going, I'm gonna clean this up.

Quagmire:
 All right, the Quahog Fair. Hey, Peter, would you get off your phone?

Peter:
 Sorry. Young girls keep killing each other, 'cause they think I'm the Slender Man now.

Quagmire:
 Are...are you...are you telling them to kill each other?

Peter:
 It's just a goof!

Bruce:
 Well, let me first start by saying yall's doing your relationship a huge favor by coming to couples counseling. Now, why don't yall start by each trying to suck up to me so I can choose who I'm-a side with.

Stewie:
 Well, I'm Stewart, and I would love to offer you a freshly baked brownie.

Bruce:
 Mmm! Oh, my! Someone's already in the lead!

Chris:
 Stewie promised he'd make healthy meals for us but all he ever makes is frozen pizza.

Stewie:
 You said you love pizza! Especially when I make the ones with the crust made of "hweat"!

Chris:
 He also does...that.

Stewie:
 Oh, really? Go ahead. Show him those girls you follow in Instagram. It's all bosoms and derrieres on there! This is all stuff I talked about with my life coach, Kyle!

Chris:
 Yeah, "life coach." Kyle's into you, and you know it!

Stewie:
 Whaaat!?

Bruce:
 Okay. Chris, why don't you tell your side of the story while I share looks with Stewart that say "Whoa! This is what you've gotta deal with?"

Stewie:
 Ooh, fudge! [reads card attached] Don't be a Grinch. Please return plate to G. Quagmire. [normal] Oh, great. So it's a gift and an errand.

Peter:
 Ah, the beach. So much to do. Unlimited possibilities.

Peter:
 There is nothing to do at the beach! Why did we come here!?

Peter:
 When I go back to school, all me greaser friends are gunna say "Tell me more! Tell me more!" and I'm gunna say you were a slut.

Peter:
 That was the first time I noticed you didn't have an ear.

Stewie:
 Come on, Brian. I'm gunna make you a YouTube surfing dog. You know, one of those videos where you can't tell if he's enjoying it or not.

Dog:
 I love it.

Brian:
 I hate it.

Chris:
 Locals have renamed me "Sandy Crevasses" and they're absolutely right. Please have all my mail forwarded accordingly.

Lois:
 I guess I'll go throw this candy wrapper in the beach trash. See you in 45 minutes.

Stewie:
 The baby thinks he's helping. He was probably filmed separately though. Notice he's just an insert shot.

Peter and Lois:
 You guys are more frustrating then trying to sell men's suits in Australia.

Glenn Frey:
 Who here wants to Take It Easy?

Uptight Guy:
 Not me. Do you read the papers? Look around you.

Glenn Frey:
 Alright, well. You wanna Take It to the Limit?

Uptight Guy:
 Not really. That would be a little foolhardy, wouldn't it?

Lois:
 It's like this is a whole Cutawayland and it takes a setup from both of us to get us in or out of Cutawayland but only one of us to move within Cutawayland.

Peter:
 Lois, are you saying that it takes a setup from both of us to get us in or out of Cutawayland but only one of us to move within Cutawayland?

Lois:
 Exactly, Peter! It takes a setup from both of us to get us in or out of Cutawayland but only one of us to move within Cutawayland!

Peter:
 Look at that. It's just as big as you want it to be but not so big that it's gunna distract him.

Peter:
 Excuse me. Is this his cold dead hand?

Mortician:
 Uh, yes?

Peter:
 He uh, he said I could have this.

Joe:
 Roar says, Chewbacca!

Meg:
 Chris, now that mom and dad are gone, we should have a rager!

Chris:
 Oh, I get those mostly in the morning.

Peter:
 Oh my God! Brexit stage right!

Peter:
 Actually, I will take this.

Nurse:
 Excuse me, doctor?

Doctor:
 What!?

Nurse:
 Pancakes aren't people. We need this wing for Covid.

Principal Shepherd:
 Is that girl here who wears the butt cheek bottom shorts?

Chris:
 No, she transferred to an alternative school.

Principal Shepherd:
 Oh ... Do you happen to know if they're having a party tonight?

Chris:
 You haven't even tried the cake!

Principal Shepherd:
 This cake says "You can beat chemo, Helen".

Chris:
 It was on a discount ... Helen couldn't beat chemo.

Peter and Lois:
 This is like the time we were together with our family.

Chris:
 W ... Where are we?

Meg:
 Mom? Dad?

Stewie:
 I haven't been given a morsel of food while you were away. Not one fucking crumb.

Brian:
 I was just driving a car a second ago. That's a problem, right?

Lois:
 First things first, did you clean up the house before coming to Cutawayland? Cuz if it's found messy it's gunna reflect poorly on me!

Principal Shepherd:
 Hello? Anyone? Hmm, quite messy. That reflects poorly on Mrs. Griffin.

Peter:
 Just tell me. Are you in the real world or are you a cutaway?

Joe:
 Uh, no. I'm at home. Why, do you need me for a cutaway?

Peter:
 Okay good. Just making sure you're not cutaway Joe. Hey, you know that should be your answering machine. Cutaway Joe to Cotton-Eye Joe.

Joe:
 ... Call me back in three minutes.

Peter:
 Joe, we don't have ...

Joe:
 Call me back in three minutes!

Joe:
 [answering machine message; to the tune of Cotton-Eye Joe] I just called you. Where did you go? Where did you run to Cutaway Joe?

Joe:
 Hilarious, right?

Joe:
 According to a 16-year-old autistic fan in Akron, Ohio, in order for The Griffins to escape from a theoretical Cutawayland, they must first journey back to the original cutaway with Adolf Hitler and kill him!

Chris:
 Who's gunna kill Hitler?

Lois:
 Peter, I gotta admit. I'm not comfortable with this plan. Yeah, I know he was evil but do we really have the right to take the life of another human being?

Brian:
 Human being? It's Hitler!

Chris:
 Wow. The middle class morality of Brian Griffin.

Meg:
 Hitler head, yo! He cried like a bitch when I did it.

Lois:
 You've been passed out for 22 minutes, babbling about cutaways and Hitler. We were so worried!

Meg:
 I wasn't that worried.

Peter:
 God, can you believe that Trump hung himself in prison?

Meg:
 Where's the priest?

Lois:
 Oh, the church ran out of priests months ago because of all the diddling. Now they just have a rabbi fill in.

Rabbi:
 Shalom, everyone. Welcome to the Christening. Now, before the child goes in the water, has it been at least 20 minutes since she ate?

Joe:
 Yes, Rabbi.

Rabbi:
 Wonderful. Then let's dunk this kid like a donut. [holds Susie underwater] I hereby christen this child in the name of Jesus Christ, who was killed by we don't know who. It's not important. The last thing we wanna do is point fingers-

Joe:
 Can you please take my daughter out of the water?

Rabbi:
 Sorry. [takes Susie out] Congratulations, sweetie. You're a Christian. From now on, every Sunday, you get to eat a hard cookie and pretend it's a guy.

Stewie:
 Oh God, here comes Doug. He just got a racecar bed and now I'm gonna have to hear about it.

Doug:
 Hey, Stewie. Still sleeping in the slow lane?

Joe:
 Everyone, I'd like to say a few words. It's a very special day, as we dedicate Susie's life to Christ before she can consent to it or have any conception of what's happening.

Chris:
 Susie once licked a booger off my hand. I'm Chris, by the way.

Joe:
 Everyone enjoy! For the kids, we've got games and also a party princess dressed as Elsa, who's clearly a prostitute but please don't proposition her here. Just nod in her direction. Trust me, she'll get it. It's her profession.

Peter:
 Gimme that, kid!

Stewie:
 I'm your son, you dick!

Doug:
 I was invited to sit at the first grade table.

Stewie:
 What!? How'd you get that invite?

Doug:
 Big D energy, Stewie. You either got it or you don't.

Stewie:
 Oh yeah? What does the "D" stand for? Divorced?

Doug:
 Stewie, my parents are trying to make it work.

Stewie:
 Oh, yeah. G-G-G-G-G-G-Good for them! Gene and Cheryl are wonderful people. I hope they make it work. Good vibes. Healing. G-G-G-G-G-G-G-God bless you all.

Brian:
 God, I can't believe Mike Pence came out of the closet just before he hung himself in prison.

Meg:
 Dad, there's a shipment of heroin in our driveway.

Peter:
 Excellent.

Chris:
 I watched a PG-13 movie last night.

Peter:
 [slaps Chris] In your mother's house!?

Peter:
 Check it out. Like all cool mobsters, my office is in a strip club.

Quagmire:
 Yeah but, why's it in a male strip club?

Peter:
 Are you kidding? Dingalings is great! Just watch where you hang your hat.

Cleveland:
 This is bullcrap! Joe, you're a cop! How are you okay with any of this!?

Joe:
 Are you asking an Irish cop why he's corrupt.

Cleveland:
 ... Question withdrawn.

Peter:
 Remember when there were two Julie Browns in the 90's? What a mess.

Peter:
 Be careful with this. We stole it.

Chris:
 Why do Italian girlfriends always throw plates!?

Italian Guy:
 Hey, can I borrow a cup of plates?

Chris:
 Sorry. I also have a girlfriend.

Cleveland:
 Man, Peter, what are you gonna do about the mob?

Peter:
 Don't worry, I've got a plan. I'm gonna hide and change my identity to a name no one else has ever heard of. Roberta Brown.

Cleveland:
 Peter, that's my daughter's name.

Peter:
 No, it's just some girl I follow on Instagram.

Peter:
 How dumb do you think I am?

Peter:
 Oh my son! I thought that hard-boiled egg seemed a little shouty.

Peter:
 I wonder where the word "godfather" came from, anyway?

Joe:
 I don't know. I assume it started with God's father.

s Father:
 Yello?

God:
 Hey, Dad, I wrote a big show, and your grandson Jesus is in it. He's kind of the star of it, really. Can you make it?

s Father:
 [laughs] Well, look at you. I'm there, pal. When is it? When's the big show?

God:
 It's Good Friday.

s Father:
 [mad at himself] Oh, don't say Friday.

God:
 Ah, I was afraid of that. Well, there's kind of a postscript to the story. Maybe you could catch that?

s Father:
 Oh, you betcha, slugger.

God:
 It's on Sunday.

s Father:
 [mad at himself] Oh, you're kidding! Doesn't anyone do anything on Tuesdays anymore? Listen, I'm getting pulled into this meeting right now, but good luck with your thing.

God:
 I promise I'm going to be so nice to my son.

Peter:
 [in Rick Deez's voice] He-Hey, Providence! This is Peter "Whirlybird" Griffin coming at you on a sizzling Sunday afternoon!

Peter:
 Oh my God! Thank you!

Prego:
 Prego.

Meg:
 What's the theme of this dance anyway?

Principal Shepherd:
 [annoyed laugh] I've been doing this a long time, Meg. Literally the next thing out of my mouth. The theme is climate change. Dance like it's the end of the world. We're going to ...

Meg:
 What do we even ...

Principal Shepherd:
 [extremely angry] MEG!!! [takes a deep breath] [calm] Thanks guys.

Bruce:
 Hey hey! It's the Megalodon!

Meg:
 Bruce Almighty! What do it look like, Boyyyy!?

Bruce:
 Listen, my shift's up in a few minutes. Can Iz interest you in half a lukewarm grilled cheese and cold fries?

Meg:
 I'd like that.

Bruce:
 And maybe after, we can take edibles and stare at the solar system carpet.

Meg:
 Oh for sure.

Bruce:
 I know a spot where there ain't too many spills.

Peter:
 Whoa! Where am I?

Scientist:
 You're a Westworld robot. You live in a computer generated simulation ...

Peter:
 Yeah, I already don't care.

Peter:
 What happened?

 Hartman:
 This should explain everything. [shows Peter the book, "A Farewell to Arms"]

Peter:
 A Farewell to Arms. [gasp] I fell in love with a nurse during World War I!?

 Hartman:
 No, no. Just the title and there's no way you read that.

 Hartman:
 We couldn't reattach your arms.

 Hartman:
 Don't worry, they'll grow back. Just spread the seeds on, keep them watered, and watch them grow.

Peter:
 P-P-P-Peter!

Meg:
 Bruce, i ... is this a date?

Bruce:
 Well, none of the other tables is shakin' they heads at us but it sure feels like one.

Peter:
 Lois, can I please see you in Joe's kitchen?

Lois:
 Don't you mean our kitchen?

Peter:
 No, they have better snacks.

Chris:
 Isn't that like a 50 year old gay guy?

Brian:
 Stewie, isn't Bruce gay?

Stewie:
 [scoff] How should I know? I should be the one asking you that.

Brian:
 Okay?

Stewie:
 Yeah, okay.

Lois:
 Bruce, don't you live on our street?

Brian:
 Yeah, I'm the house on the corner. You know the incongruous purple one with all the desert plants.

Peter:
 Uh, yes I know it well. I left my dog's expulsions on your AstroTurf man times.

Brian:
 Where are you two lovebirds off to?

Meg:
 The waxing place. Bruce is getting a treatment. I'm just getting an estimate from my team.

Stewie:
 [happily] Oh gross.

Meg:
 Is this Earth?

Meg:
 My mother is so annoying. She's got some kind of hair across her ass about us.

Bruce:
 Oh no!

Lois:
 Peter, I'm sorry. I'm just not okay with out daughter marrying someone who is clearly gay.

Peter:
 You know, you're starting to sound an awful lot like your own mother.

Lois:
 [hysterical] It's not gonna be alright! It's never gonna be alright again if they go through with this! Peter we gotta do ...

Peter:
 [slaps Lois with his tiny hand] Get ahold of yourself, woman!

Bruce:
 Hey, hey, everybody. I'd like you to meet my parents, Phil & Candy Straight.

Bruce:
 Yes, a heterosexual marriage. Just like you always wanted and I did to! All of us did!

Phil:
 Well, as someone who doesn't get subtext, I just wanna say cheers!

Lois:
 You look beautiful, Meg.

Meg:
 Really? You think so?

Lois:
 [clearly lying] Uh, ... uh-huh ... Yeah, yeah.

Guy:
 The priest's voice faded out and now it'll fade back in to show he's further along in the ceremony.

Bruce:
 Mom, dad, I'm gay!

Peter:
 [offscreen] [gasp] WHAT!?

Lois:
 [offscreen] Peter, you knew that.

Stewie:
 This feels like an episode that someone would get a prize for in 1994.

Candy:
 Maybe we should talk about this another time.

Bruce:
 No! I wanna talk about it now! I'm gay and like all gay men, it was a choice I made when I couldn't find a table at the high school cafeteria.

Peter:
 [breaking the fourth wall] Cork up those ink pots! We know that's not how it works!

Bruce:
 Jeffrey! Will you marry me?

Jeffrey:
 Oh yes!

Meg:
 Bruce and Jeffrey love each other. They deserve to be happy and so do I.

Peter:
 Meg, don't make this day about you.

Jeffrey:
 Oh Bruce!

Bruce:
 Oh Jeffrey!

Aid Man:
 Oh ... No no no no no. [grabs the bible and leaves] No no no no no.

Elle:
 Well, if you're looking for someone with issues. I think you've found your candidate.

Lois:
 I'm sorry. I don't even know your name.

Elle:
 Elle. Elle Hitler. No relation.

Lois:
 Elle Hitler. Huh. Let's all say hi to Elle Hitler.

Everybody:
 Hi, Elle Hitler!

Peter:
 You guys don't know Wild West?

Quagmire:
 No and please don't diminish us for not knowing the same things you know. Do you know to land an airplane? No. You don't. Asswipe.

Peter:
 He'd be a great mayor.

Cleveland:
 What's his stance on abortion?

Peter:
 What? I don't ...

Joe:
 Does he make exceptions in cases of incest because I've seen some things recently that make me think he probably should.

Wild:
 If you think the birth is beautiful, you should see the conception.

Wild:
 What can I do you for, stranger?

Peter:
 My name is Peter Griffin and I'm from Quahog, Rhode Island, where your cousin Adam West was our mayor for many years and since hes gone to a better place ...

Wild:
 Duluth?

Peter:
 I was thinking Heaven but okay, sure.

Wild:
 Beautiful country, Duluth. The air moves into your nostrils like a welcome guest.

Wild:
 Peter, have you ever killed a man?

Peter:
 Reddit says I've killed 39 but that seems low. Why do you ask?

Wild:
 Just making conversation.

Wild:
 Can I tell you a secret, Peter? I can levitate.

Peter:
 No way! Can you show me?

Wild:
 No, but it's true.

Peter:
 That seems like the kind of thing you have to prove right when you say it.

Lois:
 I would like to ask all women to put aside your blinding hatred for other women and vote for this incredibly qualified candidate.

Peter:
 This is America, Lois. Men have always run things and there have never been any problems, whatsoever. And don't say the economy or Iraq or income inequality or racism or Brett Kavanaugh or air pollution or Vietnam or slavery or Watergate or capitalism or #MeToo or homelessness or police brutality or homophobia or Monica Lewinsky or school shootings or Native American genocide or FOX News or Tim Allen or climate change.

Lois:
 Eh, you make a good point.

Wild:
 If you're looking for something rugged, something durable, something with an endless supply of gas and a tailgate made for dumping, then you must be looking for Meg Griffin. Meg might not be much to look at but with two different shaped airbags, Meg is one ride you won't mind taking out to the middle or nowhere and giving it all. She's road ready and road hard. Meg Griffin.

Wild:
 I moved my whole family to Oregon when I was 13 and it taught me that a town is like a horse. You don't choose it. It chooses you and I believe Quahog has chosen me just like it chose my cousin, Adam.

Peter:
 I'm sorry I'm the length of a Mike and Ike.

Lois:
 In your dreams.

Elle:
 Do you know what a meme is?

Elle:
 The other day, I saw a meme with the most adorable kitten tangled in a ball of yarn. [laughs] And underneath! [laughs] Underneath, it said fuck the police!

Peter:
 Big Garfield fan, huh? Me too. Not this big.

Elle:
 Yeah, a lot of people think I'm obsessed but I think I'm pretty Nermal.

Wild:
 My hair follicles run deeper than the roots of a sequoia.

Tom:
 With a final vote of 43 to 19, it's clear that no one really cared. Nice job guys.

Employer:
 You're really good at sexualizing children.

Brian:
 Is ... Is that a problem?

Brian:
 Cardi B tweeted something and I retweeted it with "This, this, this, this, this."

Employer:
 Wow, that is some top shelf journalism.

Brian:
 Cup of joe and a greasy roll please.

Lois:
 Okay, whatever this is, I already hate it.

Stewie:
 Best butts to sniff at the park. I um, ... I ... I don't think this is an article for human readers.

Chris:
 Now, hold on there, Stewie. Just hear the man out.

Stewie:
 Star Wars movies ranked best to worst except for the two I haven't seen.

Stewie:
 9/11s since 2000 ranked best to worst. Number one may surprise you.

Brian:
 [to Chris] Hey, I'm working on a story about fat guys belly flopping onto cement. Will you put on these roller skates and go clean the gutters?

Brian:
 Now, where's the normal well-adjusted person who works in a small town archive?

Creepy Guy:
 Yeeeeeeeeees?

Papa Bear:
 Follow the honey.

Peter:
 You can't tear this town. Pat's an icon. That statue belongs right here in the park next to the statue of Quahog's greatest missionary, Father Touchboys.

Girl:
 That statue was removed a year ago.

Peter:
 For what!?

Peter:
 My friend is the mailman. I'm gonna give him a heart attack.

Peter:
 Where do you get off?

Chris:
 In my bedroom mostly. Sometimes the bathroom or wherever I see a lady seal an envelope.

Peter:
 I'm gonna do whatever it takes to keep it up.

Lois:
 Finally, Peter cares about keeping something up.

Peter:
 [imitating Archie Bunker] Lois, will you stifle yourself?

Chris:
 Yesterday, Meg sat there without pants.

Peter:
 Yuck.

Peter:
 Brian, Pat is a hero. He practically built Quahog and his statue of part of the town! I'll be damned if I'm gonna let some draft-dodging liberals tear it down.

Brian:
 We don't have a draft.

Peter:
 Well, then, who shaved my head and yelled at me for two months?

Brian:
 Peter, we've been over this. That was The Heaven's Gate Cult.

Peter:
 Oh right. The ... The thing with the shoes. Yeah, o ... once I got the shoes, I split.

Peter:
 Brian, for years it's been a tradition that every boy when he turns sixteen has to kiss the statue's crotch while his friends take pictures.

Brian:
[confused] That's not a tradition.

Peter:
 [realizing] Ah, then I think some fun was had at my expense.

Brian:
 Pawtucket Pat was a horrible racist.

Peter:
 Well, so was Tucker Carlson but we still say hi to him at the company picnic.

Lois:
 As a woman, I need landmarks to find my way around town. I mean, without that statue, I'm completely disoriented. Okay, if anyone needs me, I'll be in the kitchen.

Lois:
 [offscreen] Dammit, who moved the lamp!?

Brian:
 Excuse me. Will you sign this petition demanding that the city take down the ...

Statue of Roger Williams:
 Take down the what?

Statue of Roger Williams:
 I'm Rhode Island founded, Roger Williams. Otherwise known as the end of the worst field trip in elementary school history.

 Williams:
 It's true. The kids are very disappointed.

Statue of Roger Williams:
 Oh, yeah, and "wife" is totally getting them jazzed.

Brian:
 I'm not getting any signatures on this petition.

Stewie:
 Really? Well, it looks like you've got quite a few. Oh, mostly, they just say "Brian is gay".

Brian:
 Yeah, I have to be careful. If 200 people write it, it goes on the ballot.

Brian:
 That's a great idea, like not separating immigrant children from their families.

Stewie:
 If you're the first one to stop applauding, that means you're racist.

Stewie:
 I guess you only payed for driver side airbags.

Brian:
 Yeah, when I bought this, I was dating a girl I didn't like.

Stewie:
 I'm too young for someone to go poo on my face!

Brian:
 Well, there's ... really no good age for it to happen.

Peter:
 Juice will not replace us!

Native American:
 We are from the Narragansett tribe., from whom Pawtucket Pat stole his recipe and we are annoyed that no one has asked us what we think.

Peter:
 You guys kind of dress like weekend Jay Leno.

Native American:
 Thank you. We just came from the Wang-Holder wedding.

Peter:
 [shortles] See? A little more of that, John Oliver, and maybe you'll finally get that 14th Emmy.

Lois:
 Quahog is still a wonderful town. I mean we still have one of those Arby's signs. You know, the ones with the big old hats?

Peter:
 That's been gone for 10 years.

Lois:
 Oh, fuck this place.

Tom:
 Our top story, the statue of Pawtucket Pat was found earlier today in the Quahog River. In the spirit of compromise, the town has decided that it will be relocated to the Quahog Museum, where it will be both remembered and never seen by anyone ever again.

Peter:
 You know, we might even win an award for this.

Peter:
 Yeah, award voters love it when someone with a right-leaning viewpoint admits they're wrong. They declare it's good storytelling and character development.

Chris:
 Ooohooh, like Three Billboards.

Meg:
 And Green Book.

Lois:
 Driving Miss Daisy.

Chris:
 American History X.

Peter:
 Yeah, all those and many more but can anyone name a single movie, where someone on the left took on a more Republican leaning viewpoint?

Peter:
 Doesn't even have to have won an award. Just has to exist.

Peter:
 Anyone? ... Anything?

Creepy Guy:
 What about Fritz Lang's Metropolis?

Peter:
 How'd you get in here?

Creepy Guy:
 In my Hyundai Sonata.

Peter:
 [disturbed] Nyeeehheheheh!

Lois:
 Well, dragging a bin full of decorations down the stairs while repeatedly yelling fuck in front of my children means only one thing, it's Christmas time!

Peter:
 [holds up a Rolling Stones knockoff shirt] But you love The Roling Stons.

Stewie:
 If this place doesn't have Baby Yoda toys, I swear to God ... I'll probably buy ... something with Spider-Man on it.

R:
 You were with M again, weren't you!?

H:
 What? No I wasn't!

R:
 Then why are you wearing a designer looking shirt at a fraction of the cost!?

H:
 Maybe I wanted to get caught!

R:
 I told you what I'd do if I ever caught you cheating! This is on you! [commits suicide]

H:
 Why!? WHYYYYY!?

Y:
 What's up? I was just taking a pee.

P:
 Someone call?

Lois:
 You're all gonna see how hard it is to make Christmas happen around here without me! I am packing my bags and I'm outta here!

Quagmire:
 You're getting divorced?

Lois:
 No, I'm just leaving for a few days and ruining their Christmas.

Mort:
 You're ruining Christmas by suing the city over holiday decorations?

Lois:
 No, I'm just leaving my family for the holidays.

Stella:
 You're doing deaf jokes?

Lois:
 No ... No one's doing deaf jokes.

Stella:
 Well, I can't hear so I don't know.

Stella:
 She's not doing them.

Greased Up Deaf Guy:
 What!?

Stella:
 I don't know.

Peter:
 I think we ... I think we ... we are doing deaf jokes at this point.

Peter:
 We're gonna delete all of her pretentious crap off the DVR.

Chris:
 I want to be the one to delete The Crown. She never watched them. She just had 'em.

Peter:
 Do it, son.

Chris:
 Well, well, well, The Crown. How the tables have turned. Remember this face? The one that wanted to watch Modern Family? Well, payback's a bitch. Delete! "Are you sure you want to delete The Crown?" Yes. "Do you understand that it's really good?" Yes! "Are you sure? It will impress your friends." Accept. "You understand that we change the cast every season." Acknowledge. "Come on. It's The Crown. It's history." Don't care. "You are not allowed to delete The Crown."

Peter:
 Alright. Time to put up the 2020 Christmas decorations. First, ethnically accurate Jesus goes right here next to Father Mary and Mother Josephine. Followed closely are the three genderless wise people on their bird scooters, Tig Notaro for some reason, and of course, The Little Drummer Them because God forbid we call a boy a boy.

Chris:
 Dad, what are you say ...

Peter:
 I DON'T LIKE WHAT THE WORLD IS! I'M WHITE! WHEN'S IT GONNA BE OUR TURN!?

Quagmire:
 [over the phone] Yeah, Merry Christmas. Um, listen, Peter, can you turn down those lights? I'm in bed with a three, and, um, extra light is not her friend.

Lois:
 Thanks for the ride and your unsolicited racial theories.

Muslim:
 I'm telling you, it's the Turks every time!

Quagmire:
 Hello, Joan. My name is Glenn Quagmire. I'm just calling to see if I have a payment due on my Discover card ... What? ... No, I'm not alone on Christmas. I'll have you know, I'm actually here with my very large family! ... Uh, prove it by telling you my children's real names that don't sound like I made them up in a panic, uh, uh, ... Bloofus and Clunt.

Brian:
 Now use this black light to read what we wrote in invisible ink while This is Us's sad "stuff's about the happen" acoustic guitar plays.

Lois:
 Wow. What is it?

Meg:
 It's a bowl we all made for you in a pottery class.

Stewie:
 A denim-shirted lesbian named CJ helped us.

Meg:
 So, Mom, who are these cousins you were in Mexico with?

Lois:
 Oh, you know just my cousins.

Brian:
 Which ones?

Chris:
 Yeah, mom. Prove it by telling us cousin names that don't sound like you made them up in a panic.

Stewie:
 Freakin' Clunt, man.

Ernie:
 There's nothing left for me in this world. I lost my job. I lost my house. My wife left me for a bigger cock.

Tom:
 For the rest of tonight's broadcast, my mommy will be spoon feeding me chicken soup. Mommy?

 Tucker:
 Tommy?

Chris:
 Hey, guys. I brought a sneeze home from school. You wanna see it?

Stewie:
 Guess we'd better line it up for butt temps. I'll go first and third.

Lois:
 Peter, you look okay. Would you mind going out and grabbing some medicine?

Peter:
 Okay, but if I get a DUI it's your fault.

Lois:
 You're drunk?

Peter:
 It's after dinner!

Peter:
 Doc, this is important...How long before she can make dinner again?

 Hartman:
 Rescues. Not worth it.

Brian:
 You know, last week's flu scare got me thinking. I don't know anything about my genetic makeup or what other illnesses I might to susceptible to.

Stewie:
 You know who'd love this story? Chris.

Stewie:
 Oh my God, Brian! You're 1% cat!...And part black.

Brian:
 WHAT!?

Stewie:
 Whoa! I was just kidding about the black thing. That was a test and you, [blows raspberry].

Peter:
 There's a lot more to being a nurse than medical mumbo jumbo. For example, what's the next holiday?

Chris:
 Memorial day?

Peter:
 The next one.

Chris:
 Fourth of July?

Peter:
 Say Christmas.

Chris:
 Christmas!

Peter:
 [puts on reindeer antlers] Eh? That's good nursing.

Meg:
 I don't think you have the makeup to be a nurse. You're impatient.

Peter:
 Are you done?

Meg:
 And you faint when you see blood.

Peter:
 I got over that. Pass the ketchup.

Stewie:
 Oh, don't buy a fainting couch, Stewie. Nobody in this house is gunna need a fainting couch, Stewie.

Brian:
 If I weren't a cat, would I be obsessed with this scratch post?

Stewie:
 That's not a scratch post. That's Meg's leg.

Meg:
 DON'T STOP!

Peter:
 Doc, this may sound silly but...[in a stupid voice] Whuddo I do?

Peter:
 What do we got?

Doctor:
 Head injury. He got knocked down.

Peter:
 We'll get him up again. I need two milligrams of Chumba and one of Wumba.

 Hartman:
 Peter, if I only helped people I liked, everyone in this hospital would be dead.

Peter:
 I took too much ecstasy in my 20's so nothing makes me happy anymore.

Peter:
 What's wrong with you, anyway?

Ernie:
 Bird flu.

Peter:
 But there's a vaccine for that.

Ernie:
 Yeah, loaded with [coughs] mercury and anti-freeze. [coughs] No thank you.

Peter:
 Ugh, I knew I hated you for a good reason.

Peter:
 Well, a wins a win even if it's like this. It's too bad, I had an awesome line I was gunna say when I finally beat you.

Ernie:
 Oh yeah? What was it?

Peter:
 Oh-hoh, it was a good one.

Ernie:
 Say it.

Peter:
 I gotta go.

Nichole:
 You get five minutes to say goodbye to your father.

s Husband:
 Sup, Ernie.

Peter:
 Holy moly, that's a huge cock.

Peter:
 Champagne?

Meg:
 Maybe open that facing ...

Meg:
 OW, FUCK! MY EYE!

Lois:
 What about a Gofundme. We're white people. That seems like a natural response.

Peter:
 He's my enemy. He gave me a bad coupon in what online idiots say was our best season.

 Hartman:
 Time of death,...Bob.

Nurse:
 8:08.

 Hartman:
 I know numbers!

Peter:
 It's just been revoked!

 Hartman:
 I think he uses that wrong a lot.

Ernie:
 You...saved me? Why?

Peter:
 Because I hate you! Every day, I wake up not knowing if you're gunna come out of nowhere and punch me in the face, I flinch every time a door opens, I look over my shoulder every time I bend down to tie my shoes, and I flip my porch light on every night before I go to bed just to see if you're standing there! Do you have any idea how exciting that is? So I didn't save your life because I like you. I saved it because...because I hate you.

Ernie:
 [smiling] I hate you too, Peter Griffin.

Peter:
 Also, if you die, I'll be solely responsible for all the destruction we've caused over the years, so this decision is both emotional and financial.

Peter:
 Good.

Stewie:
 What's she gonna do? This place doesn't even have a backroom. All the inventory is just out on the floor in ceiling high library stacks.

Stewie:
 Yeah, I know that. I'm better than every place.

Holly:
 No, those aren't the shoes.

Joe:
 Oh, hey guys. Sadly, my Uncle Ray passed away last week but he left me his vintage sports car.

Peter:
 Joe, that's amazing that your uncle died! But I'm really sorry to hear about the car.

Joe:
 See, here are all the 1950's Coke signs from the 1980's.

Brian:
 Yes, we'd like to request "Witchcraft" as arranged by Mr. Nelson Riddle.

Guy:
 [sigh] Okay, give me a minute. You should just know, there's a 21st birthday party, here and you're ruining it for them.

Joe:
 Hey, guys. What's the word?

Peter:
 Uh, bird? Bird is the word.

Cleveland:
 I see so many birds!

Joe:
 Well, we're in a tunnel, so I'm not sure how that's possible.

Cleveland:
 Malcolm in the Middle, 5 nights a week on Manchester's Channel 12.

Quagmire:
 Cleveland, stop reading fake billboards!

Meg:
 Nun, Brian steckt jetzt fest. Wir sind gleich zur ck. I host Family Guy repeats in Germany.

Brian:
 What um,...What grade are you in, bud?

Kyle:
 Second.

Brian:
 You don't say. Boy, I bet things are different than they were in my day. Lot of school shooting now.

Kyle:
 [worried] What!?

Brian:
 Oh no! No, no, I just meant...

Kyle:
 [crying] Like...Like people bring guns to school?

Brian:
 What? No, no, I'm not saying...

Kyle:
 And they just shoot kids?

Brian:
 Well, you can hide under your desk.

Kyle:
 The desks won't be enough!

Holly:
 All set. You guys getting along?

Brian:
 Yep, just great.

Peter:
 Great job, hotwiring the car, Cleveland.

Cleveland:
 The key was in the ash tray but your presumption will not be forgotten.

Herbert:
 [picks up the phone] Animal control? I'd like to schedule an emergency neutering.

Oscar the Grouch:
 [about to die] Tell my ex-wife...to go fuck herself.

Lois:
 Chris, you're within 6 years of the same age of this kid you've just met and have nothing in common with. Why don't you go up to your room and have an awkward time together?

Chris:
 Wanna go upstairs and accidentally break one of my toys and I'll hit you?

Kyle:
 I guess.

Chris:
 [offscreen] HEY! DON'T TOUCH THAT!

Chris:
 [offscreen] MOM! HE BLOCKED MY PUNCH AND HIT ME!

Peter:
 Hey, Holly. Before you go, settle an argument between me and my wife. When measuring yourself, what do you count as the base?

Peter:
 What? She measures stuff for a living.

Holly:
 Let me start by saying, I am taint inclusive.

Holly:
 Honestly, I've been thinking...

Stewie:
 [offscreen] Uh-oh.

Brian:
 Wha...Wha...What are you saying?

Holly:
 Well, Brian,...I'm still young.

Stewie:
 [offscreen] Oh, she's saying you're not!

Joe:
 Oh my God!...Huh. What is this? Is this Ferris Bueller? [thinks] Yeah,...It's Ferris Bueller. 100% on Ferris Bueller. Well, glad we got that settled.

Peter:
 It's Fast Times at Ridgemont High, you idiot!

Quagmire:
 Joe, we all watched it a week ago!

Joe:
 Oh, yeah. You know, I enjoy movies while I'm watching them but the second they're over, I can't remember a thing, except Forrest Gump. [in Forrest Gump voice] Try one of my candies. It'll tell you about life.

Cleveland:
 I liked When Harry Met Sally. [in old lady voice] I'll have the food, what made that lady came.

Joe:
 Caring for a car like that requires round-the-clock effort. You know how much of a pain in the ass that is?

Bonnie:
 [offscreen] YES!

Quagmire:
 Joe's legs are, um...colder than I expected.

Cleveland:
 No blood.

Peter:
 Ich bin froh, dass alles wieder normal ist.

Quagmire:
 Tut Mir leid wegen deinem Auto, Joe.

Joe:
 Es ist in Ordnung. Wo ist nun Jerome mit den wiener?

Peter:
 [chortles] Wiener.

Meg:
 Guten nacht, Von das Disney Corporation.

Chris:
 Then quit putting me under a fucking microscope!

Peter:
 Ah, there you are. Boy, does it feel good to walk into the right house.

Bouncer Fly:
 Sorry, gentlemen. The dog poop is full.

Bounder Fly:
 Come on in, ladies.

Brian:
 Why is Meg here?

Stewie:
 Eh, something happened last week and she can't be left alone ... like legally.

Lois:
 Meg, where you going? Come on, Meg. You gotta stay by me.

Meg:
 I wasn't gunna do anything!

Lois:
 Look, it's just a few months.

Stewie:
 Meg wandered off, that may end up being a problem.

Holden:
 I want the museum with the pumpkins!

s Dad:
 That's the pumpkin patch! It's gone!

s Dad:
 Get up, Holden ... Holden? Get. Up. ... GET UP! GOD! ... Get up and we'll get a toy.

Holden:
 Yay!

s Dad:
 I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN!

Chris:
 Alright, dad. Got my ball ready in case Xander hits a glove our way.

Peter:
 Okay. Gotta talk more sports with you.

Brian:
 Uhp, there's Meg. She's wandering outside. She shouldn't be doing that, right?

Brian:
 Meg? Come back inside. You're not in trouble. Just come back inside.

Stewie:
 She should be in her room, thinking about what she did.

Chris:
 Thanks for taking me to the baseball game, dad. It was so fun to watch the basketball game on the phone of the guy in front of us.

Peter:
 Yeah, I like that people are never doing what they're doing.

Peter:
 Hey, Chris. What are you up to?

Chris:
 Just finishing our fake memorabilia website.

Peter:
 What's this now?

Chris:
 From last night. It was your idea.

Peter:
 Oh, I was blacked out.

Chris:
 YOU DROVE US HOME!

Peter:
 Yeah, with the window open.

Peter:
 Hey, Meg, sweetie. Where's your hallway buddy?

Meg:
 Dad, I'm fine!

Peter:
 I know. You're fine. I'm fine. We're all fine. It's just I'm gunna need you to find your hallway buddy. Kay? That's a good girl, thank you.

Stewie:
 Oh my God. My new look is working. I'm back into months!

Peter:
 Could you ... Could you say that again?

Joe:
 You've gotta buy another pack of gum.

Peter:
 [sigh]

Joe:
 6648261035549.

Peter:
 Okay, 66482 ... What ... What's the rest?

Joe:
 Here, let me have Tommy Tutone sing it for you.

Tommy Heath:
 [to the the of 867-5309/Jenny] 6648261035549!

Peter:
 [singing] 6648261035549! I got it!

Chris:
 [singing] He got it!

Peter:
 [singing] I got it!

Peter:
 This is O.J. Simpson's Heisman trophy.

Chris:
 [whispering] Are you crazy!? You shouldn't claim to have that!

Peter:
 Relax, it's fine. What are the chances he tries to steal it back, twice.

Peter:
 Hey. Did he sign your head?

Peter:
 He signed my head.

Peter:
 We'll be right back.

Chris:
 Oh, boy, we are screwed. If Mr. Quagmire ever finds out that's just The Skipper's hat from our Skipper and Gilligan Halloween costume last year ...

Peter:
 You sold him my Skipper hat?

Peter:
 Damn it, I need the hat.

Peter:
 What are we gunna do?

Chris:
 Well, we definitely shouldn't kill him, dad ... Right? ... That's not an option?

Peter:
 Chris, you are now Colin Parmesan of Athens, Greece. You sell prosthetic ears to veterans.

Chris:
 Got it.

Peter:
 Would you like any more details?

Chris:
 Dad, I'm an ear salesman. I got it.

Cleveland:
 Is this someone white people know?

Cleveland:
 Is this the guy we're talking about?

Brian:
 Dr. Hartman, where'd you get your medical degree from?

 Hartman:
 I went to BU. You know our fight song, right? [singing to the tune of "For Boston"] Doi doi doi doi doi. Doi doi doi doi doi doi!

Quagmire:
 It is an honor to meet you sir and it was an honor to purchase the actual hat you wore on that fateful day. You know, I'm a pilot, myself.

Sully:
 Oh, you are? What's your record for longest "Uh"?

Quagmire:
 11 seconds.

Sully:
 Let's hear it.

Quagmire:
 Folks from the tower, uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, they've cleared us to push back. We'll be departing shortly.

Sully:
 Hey, that's great. My personal best is 34 seconds.

Quagmire:
 34 seconds in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I know. The Tulsa "uh". As I said, big fan.

Peter:
 I can't believe it. Sully didn't tell him the hat was fake.

Chris:
 Well, he's not that smart. He did crash a plane.

Peter:
 Excuse me, uh, Captain Sullenberger. I was just wondering why you pretended that was your real hat just then.

Sully:
 Well, Peter ...

Peter:
 [suspicious] I never said my name.

Sully:
 You have to believe in yourself. I didn't think I could land my plane in the Hudson but I believed I could and that belief gave me the courage to try. So, if that man believes he has my hat, maybe that will make him a little bit better husband.

Sully:
 Little better dad?

Sully:
 Little better sex character who doesn't play as well in the #MeToo era.

Peter:
 Oh, so you do watch the show.

Sully:
 It's on ... It's on a lot of planes. All I know is I didn't save 155 souls on the Hudson just to shatter dreams on land.

Peter:
 Well, Chris, I guess we learned our lesson about selling phony memorabilia.

Chris:
 Did we? We never got caught and we actually made some money.

Peter:
 Oh, yeah. You're right.

Beaver:
 [horrified] Hey, Meg. Where's your creek buddy? You're not in any trouble, you just need a creek buddy!

Terminator Peter:
 This isn't Big Mouth. You're not gonna see it.

Cleveland:
 Wait, might you be returning?

Terminator Peter:
 Yes, I shall be returning.

Cleveland:
 Could you say it in a more memorable way?

Terminator Peter:
 See you in a bit?

Cleveland:
 More menacing?

Terminator Peter:
 Let's all circle back.

Cleveland:
 No!

Terminator Peter:
 Catch you on the flipside.

Terminator Peter:
 I will see you manana.

Terminator Peter:
 Let's do coffee sooner than later.

Terminator Peter:
 Well, I don't know! Look, I'll think of some more and I'll be back.

Lois:
 Who's hungry, huh?

Stewie:
 Broccoli!? How dare you!?

Lois:
 Stewie. Don't throw your vegetables.

Chris:
 "Throw" in quotes.

Hand Turkey:
 I was created by Nathan M. cuz there's two other Nathans in the class.

Herbert:
 Okay, this one's for Nathan M.

Brian:
 Are both of these Mario Lopez sheets?

Stewie:
 Yep, I'm all in on Mario Lopez.

Stewie:
 Ah! Dude.

Brian:
 We can't go back home. We gotta keep moving. I'll need to rent a car.

Stewie:
 We could get a Yuber.

Brian:
 A Yuber?

Stewie:
 Yes, a Yuber.

Brian:
 It's Uber.

Stewie:
 That's what I'm saying, Yuber.

Brian:
 You're adding a "Y".

Stewie:
 No, that's a "U".

Brian:
 Say "Underwear".

Stewie:
 Yunderwear.

Like:
 Hey, Brian, it's 2:00. Where you at, brother? I mean aloha and everything but come on, man. I'm trying to run a business here.

Stewie:
 I found this coin in his battery box from 2060. That must be the year he was sent from. Eric Trump is on it, ew.

Brian:
 Stewie, I would never try to ... Really? Ew.

Brian:
 That's not your normal time pad, where'd you get it?

Stewie:
 I borrowed it from Rick & Morty. They borrowed plenty from us.

Terminator Brian:
 [singing] Have you heard. It's in the stars. Next July, we collide with Mars.

Lois:
 Woohoo! New Orleans! I can't wait to get up on the balcony and bust out the twins! Ha ha! Did you hear what I said, Meg? I said I can't wait to get up on the balcony and bust out the ...

Stewie:
 Feels a little hoooooooomid.

Peter:
 How did that Muppet song get in my head?

Peter:
 Oh, yeah, it was playing when we Inceptioned.

Rachel:
 Mort, may my plantar fasciitis act like roots for our tree of love.

Mort:
 Rachel, with you by my side, there is no Christmas display that I can't sue the city over.

Rachel:
 I vow to keep you nourished by filling our home with the worst wine in the world and preparing potatoes and applesauce, just like nobody.

Rachel:
 You are the plastic covering to my furniture.

Rachel:
 May we continue to have no respect for other drivers on the road and view stop signs as suggestions.

Mort:
 May my dead ex-wife's uncle's Netflix account continue to be fruitful to us for many years to come.

Brian:
 Always nice coming back to your own house, huh?

Stewie:
 This isn't your house. It's my dad's.

Delivery Man:
 I have a package for Stewie Griffin.

Stewie:
 Day just starting or ending?

Delivery Man:
 Smack dab in the middle.

Stewie:
 Oh, dude. Brutal. Well, welcome to the back nine.

Lois:
 Well, I'd advise you space cadets to come back to earth because I'm only making one thing. Okay. Meg, did you hear what I said? I said, I'd advise you space cadets to come back to earth because ...

Meg:
 [slams plate off table in annoyance] YEAH, I HEARD YOU!

Peter:
 Now, if asked, we're brothers from Sweden, same mom, different dad.

Chris:
 Well, shouldn't it be same dad, different mom?

Peter:
 No, no, no. The Swedes have a very long fertility window, Chris.

Peter:
 Now grab a yogurt that's way smaller than you knew they made yogurts.

Chris:
 And you grab an orange juice that doesn't taste like orange juice, but like someone described the taste of orange juice to an alien.

Zlata:
 I like black man in glasses.

Stewie:
 Listen, I can't talk right now. My dog is banging my wife.

Brian:
 Look, Stewie, I'm sorry. I honestly didn't think you'd care. It's not like you're having sex with her.

Stewie:
 I know, right? Once they say "I do", they don't.

Chris:
 [narrating his crime story] In the end, Dad figured out a way we could keep eating breakfast together. We just had to kill a guard or two. Actually, we had to kill a bunch of guards. It was bad. It became a so-so Netflix documentary that Mort and Rachel were able to watch with his dead wife's uncle's password.

Doug:
 Hey, Stewie.

Stewie:
 Hey, Doug.

Doug:
 Oh, I heard about Splitsville. Uh, that's why I prefer the bachelor life. Just me, my big wheel, and the doll I draw private parts on.

Levi:
 You're alright, Griffin ...

Stewie:
 Levi?

Levi:
 ...for a [censored].

Stewie:
 Stop using that word!

Lois:
 You know what I think the problem is, Stewie? I need to show them that I deserve to be customer of the week!

Stewie:
 You don't.

Lois:
 They probably see a woman like me and think she's got it all!

Stewie:
 They don't.

Lois:
 I know, it's a silly little award but I don't ask for much.

Stewie:
 You do.

Lois:
 And this is the one place...the one place that makes me feel happy.

Stewie:
 You aren't.

Lois:
 I don't understand what I'm doing wrong. I feel like I really vibe with everyone there.

Lois:
 I'm one of their best customers. If I stopped showin' up, they'd probably wonder where I went.

Stewie:
 They wouldn't.

Lois:
 Because I'm a nice person.

Stewie:
 You're not.

Lois:
 I tip in cash!

Stewie:
 So?

Lois:
 And I can't think of one reason why they wouldn't pick me!

Stewie:
 I can.

Lois:
 Thanks for listening, Stewie.

Stewie:
 I had no choice.

Alexa:
 Here is your morning briefing: In Washington D.C., Congress has passed a measure to ...

Lois:
 Alexa, skip tp celebrity birthdays.

Alexa:
 I know right?

Alexa:
 ... And you're ... You're awesome, Lois.

Meg:
 [offscreen] Hey, mom! My period started on the couch!

Peter:
 My shoes are on the roof. Get 'em.

Chris:
 If they didn't want us to put out foot down there, they shouldn't make it a perfect fit for a toilet shoe.

Lois:
 You know, I always thought that peanut just went away, when you became an adult, you know, like tonsils ... Tonsils go away, right? I thought I read that right. What are tonsils?

Guy:
 Excuse me. Are you in line for the bathroom?

Guy:
 Oh, then MOVE!!!

Guy:
 GIVE ME THE KEY!!!

Peter:
 So, how was everybody's day?

Chris:
 I made the football team ...

Peter:
 Congratulations.

Chris:
 ... Throw up because I put cleaner in the gatorade.

Peter:
 Still pretty good.

Lois:
 I almost never say anything when foreigners loudly facetime.

Lois:
 In general, I'm a pretty good person, ... right?

Chris:
 Yeah, I mean, you show a little patience for the handicapped at times but ... yeah.

Peter:
 Lois, should I stop recording? Uhp, you got a text. Uhp, I clicked it. Uhp, it's Bonnie. She's responding to you. Uhp, about me. Uhp, I'm reading the old texts. Uhp, I should stop. Uhp, but I can t. Oh, you're unhappy. Uhp, who's Greg? Uhp, there s Greg.

Peter:
 In fact, there'd be no superhero movies without Toby McGuire.

Chris:
 No way! Garfield never got the chance!

Brian:
 Is Affleck the best Batman? No, but he had the best Batman body.

Meg:
 He'll be the first ex-Spiderman to win an Oscar!

Stewie:
 Just cuz it's an animation, people think it's not legit!

Lois:
 Oh, shaving cream.

Chris:
 Mom, why are we at the hospital to visit your barista?

Lois:
 Chris, I promise that if one of your baristas ever gets into an accident, I'll go to the hospital, too.

Chris:
 Okay. That's all I wanted to hear. I've got a lot of baristas who make questionable choices.

Lois:
 Hi, you must be Lisa's mother. How's she doing? Did she say what happened?

s Mom:
 No, she mostly just said [moans inaudibly].

Lois:
 Oh, that's not a good moan.

s Mom:
 Apparently, somebody put peanuts in her car and she's deathly allergic.

Lois:
 Oh no. Here are flowers.

Stewie:
 [offscreen] She took those from a guard rail memorial.

Lois:
 Do they have any leads on who could have done it?

s Mom:
 No.

Lois:
 Good ... [realizing she almost gave herself away] Grief! "Good grief" is what Charlie Brown would say, here. Peanuts. Probably a poor choice of reference.

Lois:
 Exit stage left!

Lois:
 That was a very sad door to run into.

Lois:
 Now, there are two ways we can go from here. You can give me your absolute trust or ... I can get you hooked on heroin. Heroin's not bad. Not having heroin. That's what's bad.

s Roommate:
 People are gunna know we're gone. I promised my boyfriend that I'd ...

Lois:
 Wait, you're gay?

s Roommate:
 Yeah. You sound surprised.

Lois:
 I don't know. You just don't present as gay.

s Roommate:
 Oh, so gays present?

Lois:
 No! No. No, that's not ... What!? I'm woke!

Lois:
 [exasperated] I don't know. I ... I guess I'm not woke. Okay? Fine! You win with your gay stuff! That's what you want, right? You win!

s Roommate:
 Look, what I was trying to say is that you can't leave us like this because I promised my boyfriend that I'd make a meal for his grandmother's Meal Train. If I don't drop it off, they're gunna know something's wrong.

Lois:
 [inhales deeply] What are you supposed to make?

s Roommate:
 Beef wellington.

Lois:
 [shocked and dismayed] Wha ... B ... BEEF WELLINGTON!? For tonight!?

s Roommate:
 Yeah, why? Is that hard?

Lois:
 [daunted] YES! If you're starting at 2:00pm, very! Yes!

Peter:
 Ha ha! Too fast and too smart for ya, earwigs!

Peter:
 Now, to continue clearing the yard. [gets possessed by the earwig] Collecting moisture and sleeping in wood.

Brian:
 Hey, Lois. Whatever happened to that customer of the week thing?

Lois:
 [on edge] Uh, the ... the ... the, what!?

Brian:
 The customer of the week at the coffee shop. Did you ever win?

Lois:
 [nervously defensive] Wha ... Why? Why would you bring that up? What are you, obsessed with it!?

Brian:
 [confused] Um, you ... you have been talking about it ...

Lois:
 OH, SO YOU CAN HEAR ME WHEN I SAY THAT BUT CAN'T HEAR ME WHEN I SAY GET OFF THE COUCH!

Brian:
 [scared and ashamed] I like to be up by people.

Chris:
 You guys wanna play spin the bottle for finger stuff? Crank this night up a notch?

Stewie:
 ... I'm in.

Tom:
 Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker. In local news, two roommates were found bound and gagged in their apartment this morning in what they're calling, "The Catsitter Tier-Upper". Guys, we need to get better name comer upper withers.

Joe:
 Well, Peter, I think the main difference is Chinese people are from China and Japanese people are from Japan.

Peter:
 [whispering]

Joe:
 Yes, that's probably why you were banned from the restaurant.

Lois:
 ... Well, you could have said thank you. You don't see a lot of five dollar bills in there. I must be a pretty good person to give a five.

Peter:
 [Upset] No! I want Jerry!

Peter:
 [Lying on the floor] I'm not gonna. I hate you.

Lois:
 Come on, Peter. You're acting worse than the time Chris auditioned for Stanley Kubrick.

Lois:
 Peter you have to get a haircut.

Peter:
 [On TV] How would I describe it here? Well, we're just normal long-haired people who happen to share a love of soup and, uh, also vigorous den-floor tongue dunking. Yeah, honestly the soups are a much bigger part of it than I was led to believe. Like, I-I can't stress that enough. I always have to pee wicked during the other thing.

Stewie:
 There's a framed grandparent photo watching all that activity in the den.

Peter:
 It's where I make my liquor free from government interference. Here, try a swig.

Brian:
 [Coughs out moonshine] What's in this?

Peter:
 I have no idea. I could really use some government interference.

Brian:
 Uh, it's actually not that bad.

Peter:
 It's the police! Run!

Joe:
 Well, don't worry. I won't get far on foot.

Alex Jones:
 But now let's get back to the real news, my friends. There is a pedohebephile ring at TCBY. It does not stand for "The Country's Best Yogurt," it stands for "Take Children. Boys? Yes!"

Stewie:
 This is a search for "Hendersons net worth question mark."

Brian:
 Ah, sorry, let me go back.

Stewie:
 That says "Hendersons feet." "Hendersons daughter." "Hendersons daughter age." Yikes, Bri.

Chris:
 "Hendersons naked." Whoa "Florence Henderson naked." Her boobs look just like her eyes!

Chris:
 Anyway, I've already been fired for touching myself while the Hot Dog on a Stick ladies made lemonade.

Brian:
 That's terrible, Chris.

Chris:
 Well, to be fair, the hot dogs look like wieners and lemonade looks like pee, so I was kind of doomed from the get-go.

Peter:
 Now that there's no dog in the house, we can finally throw gross things in the open bathroom trash.

Chris:
 I've got a bloody Kleenex from when I blew my nose too hard!

Peter:
 Put it in there!

Meg:
 How about bloody toilet paper from wiping too hard?

Peter:
 Everything bloody from everything too hard goes in there!

Stewie:
 I'm not proud of this family.

 Henderson:
 Whoa, where do you think you're going?

Brian:
 Oh. I just assumed that was my seat.

 Henderson:
 Brian, we've never had an unwiped dog anus on a chair cushion before. And we're not about to change that now, as happy as we are you've returned to us.

Peter:
 I'm over here. I found your vibrator, and I was holding my thing up next to it. I thought they should meet each other.

Lois:
 [Angry] Peter, we had sex twenty minutes ago!

Chris:
 Actually, it was seventeen minutes ago. Though neither of you finished, so technically it's still going.

Peter:
 Just...I...I was very full. Just,...just know that.

Brian:
 Hey, thanks for committing a brutal crime for me, Peter. You didn't have to do that. The Hendersons treated me like a pet. But you guys treat me like family. And I miss that.

Peter:
 Look, Brian, I know we ain't as "fisticated" or "smort" or "intolergant" as them, but you're still our cat, you know? We want you to corn home.

Peter:
 Is Garrick Utley alive?

Lois:
 I ... [sigh], I don't know, Peter.

Matt:
 Hey, I've been meaning to ask all night. Those vintage pants are amazing. Where did you get them?

Peter:
 Oh, they were folded neatly on a toilet in the gas station.

Kate:
 Hey, you know, we're staring a text chain with some of the other young parents.

Lois:
 Uh, y ... young parents?

Matt:
 Yeah, new parents like us have to stick together.

Lois:
 Uh, yes we do because we're very young!

Kate:
 Great. Can we get your number?

Peter:
 Sure, we're LA-keside, four seven ...

Lois:
 [elbows Peter] Uh, he's kidding. We'll hit you with the digits.

Lois:
 This is our chance! Our chance to break away from the Joes and Bonnies of the world.

Peter:
 Well, I don't know what you're saying Lois but that horse is the dumbest horse I have ever seen in my life.

Lois:
 This is calamari. This is my placenta. Are you listening? You're gunna wanna watch where I point. Calamari, placenta!

Meg:
 Who died again?

Lois:
 Meg, listen to the lies. Nobody died. AN aunt of your father's or mine is very ill.

Meg:
 Why's Stewie going with you?

Peter:
 Stewie loved Uncle Grandpa!

Chris:
 He tricked us and we're still waiting on that lasagna!

Meg:
 Chris, that was the trick.

Chris:
 Oh.

Lois:
 Oh, look! We're in apartment 4G like the iPhone.

Peter:
 That's stupid, Lois. Don't ever say that again.

Matt:
 Hey, how's everything going in there?

Peter:
 Great! We're in apartment 4G like the iPhone!

Matt:
 [laughs] Oh, that's so twisted! Did you make that up?

Peter:
 Yes!

Lois:
 Oh, this is it, Peter. We're gunna vape! We're gunna vape!

Peter:
 It's causing deaths but not that many!

Meg:
 Ugh, I can't believe I ate both Tupperwares of calamari.

Brian:
 Man, this broom handle poke tapioca is deligious.

Meg:
 Chris had sex with that.

Chris:
 Relax, I didn't finish.

Peter:
 I only buy pants that donate the same pair to a third world country.

Other African Guy:
 Run home with these expired military condoms, Endugu! Run and make sure they use them!

Chris:
 I have an idea. Why don't we all play a board game?

Matt:
 Great idea!

Chris:
 Have you guys ever played The Wrath of the Star Eclipse: Empire: Twilight of Destruction?

Peter:
 Eh, what is that? Is that ... Is that like Sorry?

Chris:
 Uh, does Sorry have a 900 sided die and its own language of rules?

Lois:
 What the hell is Airdrop? Is that Wifi?

Peter:
 I think it's a medical term for a fart.

Lois:
 Is it ... Is it the button you hit on the plane?

Peter:
 I ... I never turn it off on the plane.

Lois:
 How do you ask Siri?

Peter:
 I think you mean "Celery". [talks to the phone] Hey, Celery.

Lois:
 It's definitely "Siri".

Peter:
 Yeah, I'm wrong.

Stewie:
 They ... They just left? Huh. I thought you kids didn't take naps. Now you're just sleeping at the bottom of a pool?

Lois:
 I hated every minute of this.

Chris:
 Uh, what's going on?

Cleveland:
 Sorry, Chris. There's a hungry new player in the catamaran game.

Neil:
 While you were at Quachella, I was building relationships. That's all the catamaran business is, Chris. Relationships.

Cleveland:
 The problem with these dark shirts is that dandruff shows but when I wear light colors, ...

Peter:
 The dandruff doesn't show but you look bigger in the show. Yeah, it's called "Guillermo's Paradox".

Peter:
 Guillermo Del Toro theorized that a fat guy's shirt can not simultaneously appear slimming and clean.

Peter:
 Well, truth be told. Meg wants me to give her a bunch of money so she can go to college and, I guess ... I guess I'd rather spend that money on alcohol.

Quagmire:
 Man, imagine how great it would feel to be retired.

Peter:
 I knew a retired kid in high school. All he ate was tater tots. He smooshed a turtle like an ice cream sandwich.

Stewie:
 You gotta get in shape, man. You know, you should meet my trainer. I think you'd really like him.

Brian:
 You have a trainer?

Stewie:
 Yes, you think it's easy looking easy for 20 years?

Stewie:
 Did you want to sign up for the full three years?

Brian:
 Three years? Don't you just do it by the session?

Stewie:
 Yeah, no. We could do a sess to sess. [writes in Brian's sign up sheet] Not committed.

Peter:
 My high school girlfriend and I still say "I love you" in e-mails.

Lois:
 Now, remember, Meg. I want you to call us every week and then every few weeks and then never.

Meg:
 I promise, mom.

Chris:
 You think I'll go to college one day?

Lois:
 [sparing his feelings] Oh,...yeah.

Peter:
 The sky's the limit, champ.

Peter:
 Wanna listen to The Doors for the next six months and then never again for the rest of your life?

Stewie:
 Now that Meg is in college, I turned her room into a gym.

Zander:
 Hey, Meg. Hi, I'm Zander. I'm in your bio class I'm not a stalker.

Meg:
 [laughs] Hey, either way.

Peter:
 I'm just not a fan of long-distance relationships.

Lois:
 Peter, I need to know if you're going to pick up Stewie from school.

Peter:
 I'll be home for Thanksgiving. We'll see where we're at then.

Peter:
 Hey, Meg. I'm a hippie now and I'm feeling the burn.

Meg:
 Bernie Sanders?

Peter:
 No, none of my hippie girlfriends shower and my crotch itches.

Meg:
 You know, despite what we're doing here, I'm still your daughter.

Meg:
 Did you join a frat?

Peter:
 I tried to but I got the letters mixed up and joined a fart.

Peter:
 Hey, everyone. I'm in college but here's a test for you. We just gave you the easiest joke setup in Family Guy history. Peter joins a fart house. Is the correct punchline: A. "And I thought calculus stunk!", B. "We don't need a pledge, we need a big can of Glade!", or C. "You wanna see a Brown quad, you should have seen my legs after Greek week!"? Good luck to you.

Peter:
 Hey, ladies. Toga farty tonight at I Delta P U.

Peter:
 Me and my fart brothers are supposed to steak the quad later.

Meg:
 I can't believe you two did this to me. Maybe if you believed in me, none of this would have happened.

Peter:
 Meg, honey. Nobody wanted you out of the house more than we did.

Peter:
 Anything's possible, like then that Starbucks cup make it into Game of Thrones.

Brian:
 You know, this whole thing has taught me an important lesson: I hate exercise.

Stewie:
 [the way he'd say "Amen"] Gay, men!

Peter:
 Hey can somebody change the channel? I'll watch anything except these stupid home renovation shows.

Cleveland:
 You know, I bet we could do our own HGTV show, if those property husbands can do it, we can do it.

Joe:
 They're brothers, Cleveland.

Cleveland:
 They're ... husbands.

Peter:
 Are you guys suggesting we make our own show instead of going to the doctor for our lethally high blood pressure?

Quagmire:
 I ... y ... you could, easily do both.

Peter:
 One or the other! Let's do it! It'll be fun!

Lois:
 Why are you wearing that? Did you go to that John Popper estate sale?

Peter:
 Me and the guys are doing out own HGTV show.

Lois:
 What!? I'M A MOM! I LOVE THOSE SHOWS! I would have done that with you. I'm just sitting here, reading a blank book. When it's not my story, they give me blank books.

Peter:
 I'm gunna gut this bathroom, pull out all the toilets and make it a kitchen. Same things upstairs and in the master.

Mom:
 So, we won't have any toilets?

Peter:
 Well, sinks are basically toilets. I mean, they're ... they're both just holes of water.

Mom:
 But it feels different.

Peter:
 I can show you and you'll see there's a very minimal difference.

Mom:
 [sigh] I just don't think I can go to the bathroom in a sink.

Peter:
 That's what everyone says until they do it once and then you realize, they're both just holes with water.

Mom:
 Why do you keep saying that?

Peter:
 Because it's true!

Lois:
 Dammit! Did you stop taking your OCD meds?

Peter:
 They don't make me feel creative!

Lois:
 We're one step away from being a blue tarp on the house family and that's always been my line in the sand.

Meg:
 Oh, hi. If I knew my lap was gunna have visitors, I would have changed my rowing underwear.

Stewie:
 Rowing? What are you, the cox?

Meg:
 Aw, she's so cute. Can I keep her?

Peter:
 Eh, I don't know. Can she set up a cutaway?

Pouncy:
 Meow.

Worker:
 Can I help you?

Cat:
 Meow. [translation: My mouse died.]

Peter:
 And just like that, The Griffins have a cat.

Lois:
 I stopped making decisions for this family when you bought that Roomba to replace me.

Roomba:
 Living room complete.

Chris:
 Thank you, Roomba.

Lois:
 [blustering] YOU'LL NEVER BE THEIR MOTHER!

Peter:
 [frightened] What day is it? Is it the purge?

Lois:
 That's not a real thing.

Peter:
 Alright, then you answer the door.

Lois:
 ... Chris, answer the door.

Quagmire:
 Hello, Christopher. May I come in?

Chris:
 I don't know. I'm just a dumb kid or at least that's what I'm told, when I ask for fun things. [to his parents] I WANT A ZIPPO!

Lois:
 You'll burn things.

Chris:
 Yeah, I know!

Stewie:
 Cool, just put that on my puzzle. I never liked this string bean.

Quagmire:
 [adoring] Hi, you! Oooohhhh, who's such a sweetheart? Oh, you are why I give up my Sundays!

Quagmire:
 Catnip is a class b narcotic. It is a drug ... Is is a drug.

Peter:
 [high] Yeah, we don't ... we don't keep any of that stuff around.

Quagmire:
 Aaah! Who put up this trip wire?

Stewie:
 Puzzling, isn't it?

Principal Shepherd:
 To whomever wrote "HOT BALLS" on my forehead, while I napped in my car, I will find you. I will find you very soon.

Stewie:
 Aaaaaah! I looked right at it! Oh, it looks like a worn out dartboard bullseye. How was Michael Jackson so into this?

Pouncy:
 [laughs] Oh my God. I am totally in your head.

Brian:
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop the clock. You can talk?

Pouncy:
 Uh, yeah. All cats can talk. We just choose not to respond ... to anything ... ever.

Brian:
 So, you choose to be dicks?

Pouncy:
 Yeah, it's hilarious. Humans are masochists, man. You should see how many toys, they've bought me. Haven't played with one. I just sit in the box.

Pouncy:
 It's soooo cute, how you still think you're their favorite pet. You've been replaced, ... bub.

Elle:
 [laughs] Well, I'd say this is the purrrrfect way to spend a Friday night.

Stewie:
 We were just discussing our book about Chinese Communism with Charmin Mayo.

Pouncy:
 Mow.

Stewie:
 You, right. You're right. Sorry, sorry.

Stewie:
 Brian, have you been watching Flat Earth videos? Those always make you mistrustful.

Brian:
 I'm serious, Stewie and there are actually some flat earth models that aren't completely idiotic.

Meg:
 Look, you may be our family dog, but you've never really been my dog. I'm a punching bag at school and at home and there were some days, where I really could've used a dog to cheer me up and where were you? Hanging out with dad or Chris or Stewie for your little time travel adventures?

Brian:
 You know about the time machine?

Meg:
 Yeah. My room's right next door. That thing's loud as fuck.

Brian:
 You have a microwave in your room?

Meg:
 Yeah, I got tired of people groaning every time I went into the kitchen.

Brian:
 You got, uh, Redenbacher's up in there?

Meg:
 Brian, stop trying to sound young.

Brian:
 Okay, booger.

Meg:
 [scoff], Boomer!

Brian:
 Boomer.

Pouncy:
 You're mine now, Meg.

Meg:
 Ow! [turned on] I like ow.

Pouncy:
 Say goodbye to Meg.

Peter:
 ... Who's Ned?

Quagmire:
 I heard everything you were saying about Pouncy, Brian and you were right to be concerned.

Brian:
 I knew it. Wait, how did you hear everything I said?

Quagmire:
 I put a cat cam in your house. It was a repurposed shower cam. It's standard cat adoption procedure.

Brian:
 Is it?

Quagmire:
 Yep.

Brian:
 The agency knew about it?

Brian:
 Cuz it seems weird ...

Quagmire:
 LET IT GO, YOU PRUDE! WE'RE LOSING VALUABLE TIME!

Brian:
 So, what you're saying is that everyone who likes cats only likes them because they literally have crap in their brain?

Quagmire:
 That's correct.

Brian:
 And people who like dogs just like them because they're chill as Hell?

Brian:
 Wow, what a bulletproof fact!

Brian:
 I'll be right back. I'm gunna save our Meg.

Peter:
 ... Who the Hell is Ned?

Quagmire:
 Midnight. Not a sound from the pavement.

Quagmire:
 It's from Cats, you idiot!

Meg:
 [offscreen] Brian!

Meg:
 Me and the peanut butter are heading up. See you in seven minutes.

Brian:
 [sigh]

Stewie:
 Chunky's kind of a weird choice, yeah?

Stewie:
 Should I pause Hawaii Five-0?

Brian:
 Nah, just watch it but don't delete it.

Cleveland:
 Fidel Castro was there to throw out the first pitch. He was wearing the same outfit as always. Later, we would find out he had a fashion disease known as chronic fatigue system. We would write more jokes about him but our dum-dum writers only know what he looks like.

Cleveland:
 In Cuba, we hated Amurrica so much we copied everything they did and died trying to get there.

Cleveland:
 We tried to play but it was difficult because hyurricane season was February through January. Every time, a hyurricane would sweep through, decimating the island, causing hundreds of dollars worth of damage.

Cleveland:
 Cuba was nice. We had a bay of hotties but also another bay of less attractive women. I forget what they called it.

Cuban:
 Oy, hermano. We're gunna cave to the Cayman islands.

Cleveland:
 Cayman in my ass. I'm going to Amurrica.

Cleveland:
 Okay, when he land in Amurrica, we all have to stop saying Coooooba.

Peter:
 Wow, Cleveland. I had no idea you played baseball. Too bad you couldn't hit a home run with The Cleveland Show.

Cleveland:
 Well, it certainly wasn't a whiff.

Joe:
 More of a foul out.

Cleveland:
 It. Was. A. Double!

Quagmire:
 On my first birthday, my mother gave me a little 'Head'.

Quagmire:
 It was understood, I'd grow up to be a tennis player like my father, and his father before him, and his father before him. We came from a long line of tennis dicks.

Quagmire:
 It was an honor playing for Freddie on grass that day. He later died. The doctors said it was asphalt.

Quagmire:
 In 2001 at the US Opening, my first serve hit a plane, causing it to go tragically off course and hit a building. Everyone blamed the Muslims. My second serve was no better.

Jerome:
 You guys talking sports stories? You know, I won a bronze medal back in the '84 Olympics.

Quagmire:
 Are you serious!?

Jerome:
 Track and field. It's a pretty good story. It's a series of coincidences that if someone wrote, no one would believe.

Cleveland:
 Oh my God. Why's there only half a medal.

Jerome:
 Whooo. How much time you got?

Peter:
 We've got about 7 minutes and I haven't gone yet. Rocky.

Peter:
 Yo, hey turtles. How you doing? How come they're not moving?

Lois:
 You sat on them yesterday. They're dead.

Peter:
 Yo, Lois. The San Gennaro Festival was last weekend. You know, I was wondering if uh, maybe you'd like to go to it with me.

Lois:
 When is it?

Peter:
 Last weekend.

Lois:
 Well, then, I don't think that's possible, Peter. No.

Peter:
 Want to maybe go to the park and feed the pigeons yesterday?

Lois:
 Peter, I already did yesterday stuff. Sorry.

Peter:
 Well, then how about we just get coffee this morning before you got to be at work?

Lois:
 It s 4:00 in the afternoon. I m afraid that s not gonna work, either.

Peter:
 Okay, well, I ll circle back last week and see what your schedule looks like.

Peter:
 Little help? ... Is my butt out? ... My butt's out, isn't it? [notices a woman behind him] Yeah, sorry you gotta see that back there, ma'am. Yeah, I ... I couldn't wipe. I had my gloves on already. [the woman vomits and people take pictures of his butt] Stop taking pictures please.

Upstairs Guy:
 [offscreen] Aaaah! Our dinnerware hutch!

Peter:
 Sorry!

Peter:
 Sorry ... Ohhh, they're mad.

Lois:
 Peter! The Rothko Exhibit at the museum is reopened! Are you busy last week?

Peter:
 Tragically, I died in training. I fell into a vat of Philadelphia cream cheese and suffocated. I guess it was a little taste of Heaven. Let's just say at my funeral, there was quite a spread.

Cleveland:
 Some of this story ain't holding up for me.

Peter:
 I was cremated.

Joe:
 I don't think any of this is true.

Peter:
 My ashes were spread over an everything bagel.

Stewie:
 It's Doug! Nice hit, bitch! Oh, and Elsa underwear! This day just keeps getting better.

s Dad:
 I'm fine but Doug's mother would probably like three martinis and then to have unprotected sex with her boss at work.

s Mom:
 And Doug's father would love a glass of warm tap water and to never make more than $30,000 a year for the rest of his life.

 Hartman:
 Yes, it s the veganism of elective surgery. If you re unsure of what to do, here s a video of Radiohead frontman and super weirdo Thom Yorke to help you decide.

Thom Yorke:
 Hello, I m Thom Yorke. You might know me from Radiohead or my passing resemblance to a melting Tilda Swinton. Not many people know that I m blind in one eye. Can you guess which one?

Lois:
 This is awful.

 Hartman:
 Oh, now you're a doctor? I guess I'm a singer now. Tra la la la la. I'm Casey Kasem. [in a Casey Kasem voice] That was Elmer Hartman peaking at #32 with "I Hate Computers (Ta La La)".

Peter:
 Don't worry, Lois. I went blind a while back. It was cool. They're some of the last people you can still make fun of.

Peter:
 It's fine. They won't see this.

Doug:
 You must be Chris.

Chris:
 I must?

Doug:
 You know, we have a friend in common. Mr. Herbert.

Chris:
 How do you know Mr. Herbert?

Doug:
 We're friends! Sometimes he comes to my art shows and we get ice cream after.

Chris:
 Let me guess. He takes you to the park where the swings go really high.

Doug:
 He does!

Chris:
 Uh-huh. That'll stop. And ice cream? Don't get used to it. [scoffs] I've seen a thousand of you. I've outlasted them. I'll outlast you.

Meg:
 I feel helpless and worthless twenty-four sevs.

Lois:
 How do you deal with it?

Meg:
 Cutting, minor arson, and sometimes I post empowerment videos on YouTube.

Lois:
 Empowerment videos? I thought YouTube went out of business. Uh, what am I thinking of?

Meg:
 Circuit City.

Stewie:
 Ah, the baseball field. Good memories. Lost my V card here with Jennifer Jason Lee in that dugout right over there.

Brian:
 That was Fast Times.

Stewie:
 Yeah, fast for her, maybe. I took a while.

Peter:
 Hi, Lois. I didn't get a monkey. Off to see Bananarama. Bye!

Lois:
 Helen Disingenuous? The beloved daytime talk show host, who gives millions away to those in need but it still somehow loathed?

Doug:
 [in an Archer voice] I'm an international spy but I also do mundane things.

Stewie:
 You know what? Go ahead and sue us. I mean, look at this guy. What do you think you're gunna get? We came here in his dog's car.

Peter:
 I'm not dad! I'm Pete the pirate! God, I already told you!

Brian:
 What a dick. You know what? I'm gunna go poop in his shoes.

Meg:
 I can't believe you've been lying! Why?

Lois:
 Don't you get it? I have to be blind to keep the money rolling in. Nobody's gunna be inspired by a middle-aged, cisgendered, able-bodied white woman.

Peter:
 Or man!

Cleveland:
 Lois Griffin, I find you guilty and I sentence you to pay your roommate back for his dog food or whatever dumb shit this one's about.

Meg:
 Yeah, that movie came out like 15 years ago.

Treater:
 Kill yourself!

Treater Dressed as Elsa:
 Trick or treat!

Quagmire:
 Wow! That's the first Frozen I've seen in 35 seconds!

Peter:
 I'll go get those aforementioned beers. Thanks, word a day calendar.

Quagmire:
 Let's cut to the chase.

Brian:
 ... I like chases.

Brian:
 Well, well, well.

Quagmire:
 Just act like a normal, well behaved, non-talking dog.

Brian:
 Non-talking?

Quagmire:
 Yeah, just bark and stuff.

Brian:
 Bark? Jeez, it's been a while. Let me give it a try. [trying to bark] Brak.

Quagmire:
 Brak? The Hell is that?

Brian:
 I'm finding it.

Carrie:
 Hi, Glenn. This is Dexter. [notices Brian] Aw, and who's this little guy?

Quagmire:
 [nervous] Uh, uh, this is Harvey. Named after Weinstein. Uh, cuz you can see his balls when he answers the door. [chuckles] I may be dating myself but in the 90's, the funniest thing you could so was show people your balls. [chuckles] Can you start talking now, please?

Carrie:
 Sorry. I couldn't hear you cuz my dog was licking my ear.

Quagmire:
 Oh thank God. This is my dog, Bob ... [nervious] Weinstein. He's man's best friend cuz he's very good at keeping quiet. Uh, you mind if I take five minutes in the parking lot?

Quagmire:
 [confident] This is Spot.

Peter:
 Aw, not at the dinner table.

Quagmire:
 Is that one just a back half?

Carrie:
 Oh, Backsy? Yeah, she's a fighter.

Quagmire:
 Maybe she should stop fighting.

Stewie:
 Who are we waiting for, Chris?

Chris:
 I called in some professionals. They're gunna take us somewhere dad will never find your candy.

Stewie:
 And where's that?

Chris:
 I can't say. There are ears everywhere. [notices Mr. Feldman] Good morning, Mr. Feldman.

 Feldman:
 Morning, Chris. Couldn't help but overhear, you're off on a little trip.

Chris:
 [chuckles] Nevermind about that, Mr. Feldman.

Chris:
 [whispering to Stewie] See?

 Feldman:
 [offscreen] I could hear that!

Stewie:
 You know, I should really be in a backwards-facing car seat.

Stewie:
 You have any kids?

Chris:
 Don't make small talk with these guys.

Russian:
 No, no. It's alright. It's nice to have someone ask for a change. Yes, I have four children. All dead.

Stewie:
 Ah.

Pilot:
 Uh, folks our party time tonight is 2 hours and 48 minutes. We know you have lots of choices for terrible weekend activities and we hope to see you soon for an inconvenient weekend for their destination wedding, which I hear is on a Thursday, in Lisbon, Portugal.

Pilot:
 Yep. Yep.

 Feldman:
 I'm hearing a lot of good things about that guy.

Quagmire:
 I've been lying to you and I've been lying to myself. There's something you need to know ... I hate dogs!

Pilot:
 This party has begun its initial descent.

Pilot:
 Uh, folks, please use caution as you exit the party as some of your feelings may have shifted.

Quagmire:
 I'm coming for you, Brian the dog. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but one day ... Maybe tomorrow.

Wild:
 Now, if'n you don't know, most Hollywood screenplays wrap up at around 110 pages and if'n it's a comedy, well, you want it in the 90's.

Wild:
 Men, don't be afraid to have the doctor put a camera up your old saddle masher. They knock you out, now and it's a good way to make sure there's no bad beans in your mess wagon.

Peter:
 That information has been lost to history.

Miss Tammy:
 [using the phone] Hello, Show and Tell national championships in Dekalb, Illinois? I have a nominee than you.

Joe:
 It appears that someone has exposed your son to the very problematic teen films of the 1980's.

Lois:
 Peter, tell me it wasn't you.

Peter:
 Honestly, Lois. I have no idea. My brain can't even think thoughts no more cuz of the internet.

Doug:
 That jungle gym dates back to the 1930's, when the lives of children were expendable.

Stewie:
 If I do this right, I'm gunna be remembered forever like 9/11 was for a few years.

Peter:
 Whatchyoo talkin' 'bout, Lois?

Peter:
 The 80's will always be the best decade and I'm confident that non-whites and women would agree with that.

Peter:
 [calls up to his family] Family. Come here, conveniently fast, please.

Brian:
 What is it, Peter?

Peter:
 Man, I was so sure that stuff from the 80's would still play the same today. I guess people are only interested in that for 19 seasons.

Stewie:
 You realize, Doug, that we might die up there today.

Doug:
 Then I'll see you in heck.

Stewie:
 I'm stuck up here! Better use my emergency flare.

Pilot:
 We've got a flair.

Stewie:
 I'm still stuck but now I have confidence.

Peter:
 You know how you told me to give up the 80's and find a whole different decade to be into?

Lois:
 No, that's not what I...

Peter:
 Well, I'm doing the 1920's. Not cuz of legal cocaine but mostly cuz of legal cocaine.

TV Announcer:
 Cocaine! The winner of the war on drugs.

Stewie:
 You're gunna hate me, but I really need to take this.

Doug:
 Don't you dare!

Stewie:
 But it might be Bruce Lee finally calling to admit that I'm the best at kung-fu!

Bruce Lee:
 This is your once chance, Stewie. I will no call you a second time.

Peter:
 Boy, who knew when you stopped doing cocaine, you'd get depressed?

Movie Announcer:
 This summer, don't miss Jungle Gym Mountain, starring Chris Pine as Doug.

Movie Announcer:
 And Paul Giamatti as Stewie.

Stewie:
 Come on!

Paul Giamatti:
 Help! I crapped my pants and I'm afraid of heights.

Stewie:
 I'm out of here.

Movie Announcer:
 And Chris Hemsworth as Thought Bubble Girlfriend.

Stewie:
 I'll give it a shot.

Lois:
 [takes out a stuffed monkey toy]...I found Chi Chi! He's like your doll, Reuben.

Quagmire:
 But first, a dump so long, I will be able to read everything Garfield ever wrote.

Quagmire:
 [chortles] Jon.

Quagmire:
 Hey, did you know, if this plane was a wiener. We'd be the wiener's eyes.

Doug:
 Goodnight Moon? Ugh, Stewie's so basic.

Stewie:
 [gasp] Oh my God!...I can't read!

Stewie:
 I can't do it! I can't kill a cat!...Unless you were in the movie musical with Rebel Wilson?

Brian:
 What's your problem? Why are you being such a jerk to me?

Peter:
 My problem with you? Let's see. Where do I begin? You accept food, clothing, and shelter, yet no responsibilities. You constantly want to sleep with my wife, who is an angel. Oh, and the hypocrisy! You claim to be an ally to women but I bet you don't even know Nancy Pelosi's official title.

Brian:
 Sure I do. She's uh,...Chuck Schumer's secretary.

Brian:
 Awwwww, yeah. She ran fast because Bonnie was watching.

Joe:
 What happened to you?

Quagmire:
 I was in line at the bank and this human sized-chicken cut in front of me. Well, I wasn't gunna let that stand!

Peter:
 I asked like 7 people if they were gunna watch the SpaceX launch and I...I don't even know what that is.

Seamus:
 Me, I don't wear underwear. I just wear trunks...Tree guy. That'll hit you when you're driving home.

Cleveland:
 Oh my God. I still can't believe they wore each other's underwear. Like, can you imagine?

Joe:
 I know, right? Like, icky times a thousand! Hey, this is crazy. What if we wore each other's underwear, just for a joke?

Cleveland:
 What? No, that's a terrible idea.

Joe:
 Uh, just ... just joking.

Joe:
 [mad at himself] I'M SO STUPID!

Bonnie:
 Can I be done now?

Brian:
 It went poorly.

Ida:
 Thanks again for having us over, Lois. [notices the salad dressing] Zesty Italian? Oh, I...I just couldn't not this close to bed time.

Quagmire:
 I went to the underwear doctor and...you should probably get checked. They say when you wear someone's underwear, you're also wearing the underwear of everyone whose underwear they've worn.

Peter:
 I can't believe this! I thought I knew you, Glenn Quagmire!

Ida:
 What's going on here, you two? You're being very rude. Lois spent all day, overcooking this meal!

Lois:
 Ladies switch underwear all the time. I might be wearing Bonnie's right now. I don't even remember.

Peter:
 While that is super sexy and being stored for later, it's very different for guys.

Ida:
 Male friends can be more intimate than they used to.

Peter and Quagmire:
 No.

Ida:
 And the lines of sexuality are more fluid than ever.

Ida:
 And people aren't so quick to judge or label.

Peter:
 Please stop.

Quagmire:
 I'm afraid our relationship is on the skids.

Peter:
 Maybe there's hope for the future but things now are too spotty. I just don't know if there's any front or back to this. Our reputations are smeared. If I wasn't so yellow, maybe I'd push harder but hey, we had a really good streak, huh?

Doug:
 Well, what do we have here? Stewie Griffin, cat murderer?

Stewie:
 What? You psycho! You killed her!?

Doug:
 Maybe I did. Maybe she died of natural causes. The only thing that matters is that now, I have the goods on you.

Stewie:
 Oh, that's a terrible photo. Would you mind doing that again?

Stewie:
 Aw, yeah. That's cute. Can you send me that?

Stewie:
 Who is that?

Doug:
 That's Tyler. He's uh,...kind of 'my' Doug.

Stewie:
 Boy, we all get a Doug, huh?

Doug:
 Yeah. Tyler's Doug is a drunk stepdad.

Peter:
 Sorry, I spaced on your name at the party store. Have a good one, Brent.

Brian:
 [offscreen] His name, you remember.

Peter:
 Uh, Joe, isn't that the same stick we gave you for your wedding?

Joe:
 You told me it was a magic wand.

Peter:
 I pointed it at a bus. The bus crashed. That's all I'm saying.

Girl:
 [awkward] Actually, Stewie. There's something important I sort of need to talk to you about.

Stewie:
 [unnerved] Okay.

Girl:
 I recently found out...I have cooties.

Stewie:
 [unfazed] And you're telling me, why?

Girl:
 Well, I mean,...Remember last week? When we ate from the same Play-Doh?

Girl:
 Stewie, listen. I just think you should get tested.

Stewie:
 [shocked] What!? You mean I played with the Play-Doh everyone you ever played Play-Doh with played with? I've been played!

Fat Girl:
 Can I have a chocolate milk with my snack today, please?

Stewie:
 What?...Honey, the chocolate milk is the snack.

Peter:
 [bowing like a ninja] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Peter:
 Man, something smells good in here. You cooking brussel sprouts?

Bonnie:
 No, I just farted.

Bonnie:
 You know, I usually cook for one and a half but Joe's still on his stakeout. You wanna stay for dinner?

Peter:
 Aw, man. I'd love to but it'd be wrong. I always eat dinner with Lois.

Bonnie:
 [disappointed] Aww, you sure? You can sit in Joe's dining harness if you like.

Peter:
 How does he get into that thing?

Bonnie:
 We have a large array of medical grade cranes and pulleys that lift him.

Peter:
 Man, that must make the house ugly.

Bonnie:
 [cantankerous] It does.

Peter:
 So, how long have you used Invisalign?

Bonnie:
 You can see it?

Peter:
 Yeah, I mean it's ... just a name. Not a fact.

Kid:
 What underwear do you recommend?

Doug:
 Depends. [laughs] Sorry, old joke.

Stewie:
 Brian, this is The Flintstones cocktail I have to take every day. 17 Barneys, 18 Wilmas, I have to take the Bamm-Bamms just to keep things moving!

Peter:
 Oh, this is better, Bonnie.

Lois:
 Did you just call me "Bonnie"?

Peter:
 No! Go...God, no!

Chris:
 We all heard it, dad.

Peter:
 [pissed] Hey, Chris...Okay? Got it?

Meg:
 What if you spun the plate around, dad? Try it from behind.

Peter:
 Meg, go to place.

Meg:
 Ugh, do I have to?

Peter:
 I said go to place!

Stewie:
 And no, Rupert, getting high is not getting sober. I don't care if you found the one A.A. group in town that tells otherwise.

Brian:
 Enough, Stewie! You're taking this whole thing too far! I'm washing my hands of your cooties, which, had you done in the first place, might have prevented all this.

Stewie:
 You see, Rupert? That's why I'm glad you stopped drinking. You were that ugly.

Chris:
 [puts his arm around Lois] They sure do grow up fast, don't they?

Lois:
 Chris, have you masturbated today?

Chris:
 No, ma'am.

Lois:
 Well, get up there!

Lois:
 and don't come back 'til you...

Chris:
 What's for dinner?

Stewie:
 [on video] Hello, Brian. If you're watching this, it means you couldn't find your phone charger and came in to use mine.

Brian:
 Man, am I that predictable?

Stewie:
 [on video] Yes, yes, you are.

Stewie:
 [on video] If they make a movie about my life, don't let Jim Carrey play me. Unless he gets his eyes done. Even then, though. Ugh. Hard maybe.

Stewie:
 [on video] Oh, and also, you can have my penis enlarging machine. It's in my closet.

Stewie:
 [on video] Ah! Did you look!? [laughs] Will you...Will you text me if you looked?

Chris:
 [puts his arm around Meg] Long days, short years, huh, Meg?

Lois:
 [offscreen] Chris, masturbate!

Chris:
 Jerk!

Joe:
 Oh, thanks for pre-chewing my meal, babe. The food shuttled out of my cloaca much better that way.

Joe:
 Oh, God. Peter's texting me about going to The Clam. That guy is getting insufferable. And that dumb Shaquille O'Neal gif. It's like, we get it. It's humorous for a man that large to act playful.

Peter:
 I don't like when Bill Murray is serious.

Nurse:
 Almost done, Stewie. Do you have an email address for our mailing list?

Stewie:
 Uh, no thanks. I'm about to kill myself.

Brian:
  I felt like my life was ending, but I was wrong. When I was driving up here to the clinic, I saw the leaves change. I tapped a maple tree and milked a cow. I...I tried fresh cream for the first time and went to a writer's retreat. I met Margaret Atwood and we foraged for wild mushrooms.

Stewie:
 [sarcastic] Wow, sounds like you were in a real rush to get here.

Brian:
 We could be hit with an unprecedented pandemic that the government is slow to recognize, woefully unprepared for, and then mismanages with reckless incompetence.

Peter:
 Yeah, you first question. Go ahead.

Peter:
 Yeah, I'm not gunna be answering any questions about Meg. We'll be dealing with Meg internally. [calling on someone else] Over here.

Peter:
 I thought it played pretty well. Uh, we'll have to look at the tape on that and make a decision, moving forward. [calling on someone else] Yeah?

Peter:
 [leaves in a huff] Alright, I'm done here.

Chris:
 Hi, I'm a 15 year old wild card and ...

Peter:
 It's my new pitching machine, Lois and look, it can turn our car into a silly tank. Watch me nail Cleveland.

Cleveland:
 [offscreen] I got one too, bitch.

Chris:
 ... But it turns out the real Dianetics was the friends he made along the way.

Stewie:
 And, I'm waking up outside again. Gotta sleep to grow, guys. Gotta sleep to grow.

Peter:
 You know, Carter. We don't mean to be a bother. Why don't we just stay at a hotel and you pay for the hotel and it should be the Legoland hotel?

Carter:
 I have to leave town for a couple days and I need someone I can trust to look after the place.

Brian:
 Where's Babs? Why can't she do it?

Carter:
 I don't know. The ransom note didn't say.

Peter:
 You were lucky to have a nanny. My mom just left me with a radio possessed by the former owner of our home.

Peter:
 Can I have a snack?

Radio:
 You're sitting where I died.

Carter:
 Ass, gas, or grass? No one rides free.

Lois:
 I guess...gas?

Carter:
 That's what all the prudes say.

Lois:
 Well, it'll be nice to have a little road trip together. We never had a lot of daddy-daughter time when I was young. You were always so busy.

Carter:
 Not now, kitten.

Chris:
 When you say "help those people with their bags", I'll ask "how high?".

Brian:
 Alright, stop by Brian's bar for some drinks, thinks, and winks.

Stewie:
 Ah, Principal Shepherd, newly single. Lost half the school in the divorce.

Stewie:
 I do all of Kevin Spacey's matchmaking.

Stewie:
 So, you're not interesting in having sex with Kevin Spacey.

Stewie:
 Oh, good. Kevin's gunna love that.

Elle:
 These are gunna go straight to my thighs. [laughs] If only I could find a man to do the same.

Elle:
 You saved my life! How can I ever repay you?

 Hartman:
 Money?

Jacqueline:
 I have a brain thing where I go blind every 45 seconds. Hi, I'm Jaclyn. I'm Meredith's sister.

Lois:
 Really? Oh, it's so nice to meet you. I'm Lois. I...I am so sorry for your loss. Meredith was my nanny a long time ago.

Jacqueline:
 Oh, is that right? Oh, that...well, that's so nice of you to make the trip. You see, Meredith [goes blind] Da...Darkness...Darkness. Just ride it out! [regains vision] And, we're back!

Jacqueline:
 I don't believe the Earth is round, so that's me.

Jacqueline:
 Oh, excuse me. The funeral director is here. I'm trying to avoid paying him.

Peter:
 Pewterschmidt Hotel. Don't tell Lois.

Peter:
 I'll transfer you.

Chris:
 The spa at Pewterschmidt Hotel. Don't tell mom.

Lois:
 Chris?

Chris:
 I'll transfer you.

Meg:
 Pewterschmidt Hotel laundry. Don't tell mom.

Lois:
 Meg?

Meg:
 Mom?

Lois:
 Yeah, I'll transfer you.

 Hartman:
 Evening. I'm looking forward to the doctor being in.

Principal Shepherd:
 Hello, there. Maybe I can see you between periods?

Elle:
 Who do you think I should choose?

Brian:
 Well, if it were me in this situation, I'd just go along for the ride and see what happens.

Elle:
 [dissatisfied] That's it?...That's your advice.

Brian:
 Well, it's...it's just what I...

Elle:
 [miffed] You know, I'm trying to take some agency in my life and you're over here, telling me to just see what happens. That's not helpful.

Brian:
 Threesome?

Elle:
 [gasp] Excuse me!?

Brian:
 Not with me!...With me?

Lois:
 Hi, I'm Lois Griffin. I, uh,...I just wanted to be here today to say goodbye to Meredith and thank you. Thank you for raising me and...and...and for being there when no one else was. That's why I was so hurt when you left and I always held it against you but now I realize, it wasn't your fault.

Carter:
 You know she can't hear you, right?

Lois:
 But no matter what happened, Meredith, thank you for being my teacher. Even today, you're teaching me that the people you love most of all can still betray you.

Carter:
 I'm sorry, Lois. You were right. People you love can betray you but if they're rich enough, they can buy apology ponds.

Carter:
 [gets a text message] Oh no! Rafael, the old gardener died. [to Lois] I have a story I have to tell you and spoiler alert, you'll be getting another pond.

Peter:
 Okay, Brian. What do you got for me?

Brian:
 Okay, birthday jokes. [reading one of his jokes] We may be colleagues, but there's no one in your league.

Peter:
 Boy, that's a brick off the backboard. Chris, what do you got?

Peter:
 ...Chris, that's going in the show. See that, Brian? Don't be afraid to pull our heart strings.

Miss Tammy:
 Children, please continue independent play, while I go see if I just sneezed by tampon out.

Doug:
 Hey, Stewie. Whatchya readin'? Something with different cloths to feel?

Stewie:
 Uh, no, not since uh,...not since COVID.

Stewie:
 The elementary school? But that's where all the big kids are!

Bruce:
 Oh, I'm sorry. Did I ruins yall's reveal? Let me go ahead and scooch back a little.

Stewie:
 Detention kids are scary, especially that 4th grader, writing on the board.

Stewie:
 Oh, that is such a load of [in Mickey Mouse's voice] truth! A wonderful load of truth!

Peter:
 Alright, birthdays! Woop! Woop!

Preston:
 What the hell is this?

Peter:
 It's happy birthday. To! You!

Preston:
 I didn't approve this.

Peter:
 Oh, yeah? Well, who the hell are, You!? You!?

Preston:
 I'm Preston Lloyd, the new manager of the brewery and your boss.

Peter:
 Is that, True!? True!?

Preston:
 Yes and I've been charged with improving brewery productivity and it has become clear to me that the best way to start is by canceling office birthdays, effective immediately.

Peter:
 I don't know how to stop on roller skates so hang on until I run out of momentum...

Peter:
 ... [offscreen; infuriated] WHAT!?

Preston:
 I've been sober for 46 years.

Peter:
 How old are you?

Preston:
 46.

Preston:
 Attention, employees. This is Mr. Lloyd, your manager. I will now resume the office birthday celebration from earlier. [ahem] Helen Daly, date of birth: 12/10/1968. Martin Burke, date of birth: 12/13/1969. J.H. Christ, date of birth, 12/25/0000. You now have two minutes to consume cake.

Stewie:
 Hey, do you know where I can get a pacifier in this place? I'm jonesin'.

Peter:
 I can't believe the new jerk manager canceled office birthdays. It was the one thing in life I looked forward to.

Cleveland:
 Is this manager a no-nonsense, buttoned-down man, who's also been in the military?

Peter:
 How'd you know?

Cleveland:
 Mmm-hmm.

Bird:
 [tweets in subtitles] "Climb up here and hang yourself."

Joe:
 Boy, wouldn't you like to know what those little guys are saying?

Tour Guide:
 And this is our final stop on the tour.

Preston:
 What's this room?

Tour Guide:
 Oh, this is an unused meeting room that no one pays attention to.

Preston:
 Ah, well then, I suppose there's no need to pay any attention.

Peter:
 Okay, there was an elderly Jewish family hiding in there and I don't know WHAT to tell them.

Teacher:
 Well, Stewie, you've completed your detention. What have you learned from this experience?

Stewie:
 That your mother's a whore?

Stewie:
 I got jacked.

Brian:
 You look exactly the same.

Stewie:
 And yet, I got jacked.

Preston:
 Okay, time to make this office my own and decorate it with my prized achievements. [starts on packing a box] Ah, let's start with my Big Mouth Billy Bass with the battery removed so I don't have to be interrupted by that nonsense.

Preston:
 I made a decision to cancel office birthdays and it was very explicit.

Peter:
 There was nudity?

Preston:
 Mr. Griffin, you leave me no other choice. You're fired!

Peter:
 Fired!? Can I still get paid and just not come?

Preston:
 No.

Lois:
 I can't believe you were fired from the brewery, I mean, how are we gunna pay our bills?

Peter:
 Well, that depends. When you use Venmo, do they,...just, like...believe you like they have the money?

Lois:
 No! [to Chris and Meg] Right?

Meg:
 No!

Stewie:
 When did this new slab of beef get delivered?

Chris:
 My name's Chris.

Stewie:
 You don't have a name until I give you one.

Stewie:
 I could be your friend. All we'll need is a bic pen and a lighter.

Chris:
 Why? So you can burn a swastika into my butt?

Stewie:
 Well, you just ruined the surprise, you goofball!

Preston:
 And that's how you say "productivity" in 11 different languages, which, in hindsight, was not a productive use of time.

Peter:
 I just came to clear the search history off my computer before the IT guy, [notices the IT guy taking his computer away] uhp, he's already got it.

IT Guy:
 Boy, you're really all in on Asa Akira.

Peter:
 Lay off, this is the only place where I can masturbate.

Preston:
 I guess I've learned that employees are willing to endure a crappy job, low pay, meaningless work, no upward mobility, laughable benefits packages, countless OSHA violations, exposure to hazardous waste, and emotional abuse as long as there are balloons and pieces of cake once a month.

Red Wiener:
 Say, can we go to the next scene with one of those cinematic sideways wipes they used to do in the '30s?

Meg:
 Sweet. Tree lighting. Guess that means it's showtime. [takes out a bag of eggs]

Meg:
 Oh, nothing. Just my own tradition of putting four dozen hard-boiled eggs in a Kroger bag and passing them out at the tree lighting.

Peter:
 Okay, we get it, Meg. You're dark and different. [whispering to Lois] Wow, Meg really is dark and different.

Wild:
 Right here, in front of City Hall, I'm placing this wooden Nativity Scene, that I whittled myself from a peach tree, what was rat-tailed by a lighting in a recent meteorlogical electricities.

Brian:
 Oh, great. Just what we need. A religious display on public property. Can't believe this is what my tax dollars are paying for.

Qugamire:
 [scoff] Last I heard, you've never paid taxes in your life.

Brian:
 Only cuz I've never made enough money! Ha!

Cleveland:
 Brian, I can laugh at a lot of things but Jesus Christ is not two of them.

Happy Asking Panda:
 Yay! Merry holiday data information!

Quagmire:
 He's not Australian! He namechecks Vancouver in the song!

Joe:
 A guy from Australia can't know where Vancouver is? Feels kind of racist.

Brian:
 You kno...You guys know, all...wha...this holiday is all about, right? It's all about this! [makes the "pay me" sign]

Cleveland:
 The world's smallest violin?

Quagmire:
 A scrotal massage?

Joe:
 Ah, just like in the old country?

Brian:
 You know what? Screw you guys! Alright? Screw Frosty! Screw Guaraldi! Screw both Rankin and Bass!

Joe:
 I'm with him on Rankin, but come on, what did Bass do?

Tom:
 Mayor West, what can you tell us about the disappearance and also about my parking ticket and I'll remind you the tree limb was blocking the sign.

Wild:
 That tree was a hardwood, Mr. Tucker and there wouldn't have been a leaf on it, 'til mid-May.

Tom:
 The printing of the restricted times was also faded.

Wild:
 Whoever took that Nativity Scene best sleep with one eye open cuz I'm on your trail and I'm gunna hunt you down like the mighty grizzly hunts a Slim Jim left on the dashboard of a Ford Taurus...I regret that the west has changed.

Brian:
 That's rather odd. Who would steal a Nativity Scene? [his voice gets higher]

Stewie:
 Wanna tell me what's going on, champ?

Peter:
 Hey, you're the man from the TV. Please come in. I'm the man from the couch.

McGruff the Crime Dog:
 Take a bite out of crime.

Brian:
 And don't forget to bark at it.

Wild:
 What's in a Nativity Scene?

Brian:
 Nativity Scene, sure, uh. Well, you've got your drummer, uh, probably a bassist too. Um, Jesus, of course. Um, ...Mr. Christ?...I'm gunna say Santa? Then also the elves. Uh, the pig who makes friends with a spider. Writes, uh, nice things in its web....S...S...S...Slate? S...Somebody named Slater?

Wild:
 I think he's from Saved by the Bell.

Red:
 You ate my whole family, you fat bastard. [pulls out a gun] One more day.

s Secretary:
 Sir, as you've requested, I've transcribed all your text messages onto pieces of dried cow hyde.

Wild:
 [reading through his texts] Spirit Airlines parking lit. Parking lit. Parking lit. Asterisk, lot. LOL.

Aunt Betty:
 Oh, you really didn't have to do this.

Wild:
 We both know I did.

Wild:
 Brian, is there anything you wanna say about the Baby Jesus-shaped dent in the hood of your car?

Brian:
 Oh, come on! That doesn't prove anything! That could be any baby I hit with my car.

Wild:
 Brian Griffin, you're under arrest.

Peter:
 Just for destroying public property and fleeing the scene of the crime?

Stewie:
 Why are we not leading with drunk driving?

Wild:
 I'm afraid I have to take you to jail.

Lois:
 [pretending to care] Oh, no. Not Brian. Do we get the Hallmark channel back?

Brian:
 You get three square meals in jail, right?

Wild:
 Well, I can't speak for the shape but the numbers sound right.

Peter:
 Hey, Brian. Sorry about the sling. I got shot by an M&M.

Peter:
 Well, it certainly is great seeing you, Brian.

Joe:
 Hey, guys, unfortunarely visiting hours end at...[looks at his watch]...10:14.

Peter:
 [pretending to care] Aw, aw. It's like we just got here. Aw.

Brian:
 The "Penis" is right. I do miss my family.

Wild:
 Why don't you head outside to your family?

Brian:
 I will, but first there's something I gotta do.

Brian:
 [thinking Wild will like it] Eh?

Wild:
 [dissatisfied] It's like you killed him all over again.

Chinese Woman:
 [gives her boss a file] The Griffin assets, sir.

Chinese Man:
 At last. [reads the file] $17? The bear cost $23 to make! Oh, no.

Peter:
 [narration] Can't rob America if America's broke. Merry Christmas, everyone!

Peter:
 I'm often self-centered, confuse my words, and shellfish.

Lois:
 How dare you buy me something that suggests I need exercise!?

Stewie:
 Anybody have Valentine's Day in the divorce pool?

Chris:
 That would be Meg.

Meg:
 Boom, boom, boom!

Stewie:
 Picked a holiday. Smart...She's smart.

Cody Spraytan:
 Are you ready to pedal so hard your periods go away?

Lois:
 Yes! It's not healthy, but it's convenient.

Lois:
 I hope that mascara burns your eyes out!

Bonnie:
 How's that cheap wine hitting!?

Lois:
 Oh, go roll in dirt, you pig!

Bonnie:
 Your hair dye stinks!

Both:
 Tell your son/daughter to stop watching me change!

Meg:
 Wow, mom. You are looking fit.

Chris:
 Yeah, you're ripped. You look like Madonna.

Lois:
 [intense] You wanna say that again? Who do I look like?

Chris:
 [choking] The mom from Modern Family.

Lois:
 That's right. Julie Bowen. That's the appropriate answer.

Lois:
 I gotta say, Peter, I love that bike. Maybe you should give it a try.

Peter:
 No way. Name one cool person who rides a bike.

Lois:
 Kermit the Fro...

Peter:
 Okay, skinny legs. Here I come.

Oliver Platt:
 While you're waiting, check out my 1993 medium hit, The Three Musketeers because I only do movies with titles that are also candy bars.

Priest:
 All hymns now identify as they and of course, amen is now athem.

Stewie:
 I want you to make it look like Caillou.

Preist:
 You know, one of our altar boys called in sick today. How would you like to fill in for him in the choir?

Peter:
 Well, okay but only if God will kill a bunch of babies for no reason.

Priest:
 That's not a problem. God does that a lot in the bible.

Priest:
 That was wonderful, Peter. Way better than our previous choir, who killed half out congregation during COVID.

Priest:
 You know, a wise man once said "The thing about humanity is that we get stronger with adversity".

Peter:
 Who said that? Jesus?

Priest:
 No, it was Justin Bieber's dad on Twitter. The answer to pretty much all of life's questions are on Twitter. Try there.

Jesus:
 I am here to help you with your problem.

Peter:
 You're gunna help me win an emmy?

Jesus:
 Whoa, no no no. Your choir problem. There's some things not even I can do.

Peter:
 Maybe you can ask your dad?

Jesus:
 I'm not gunna ask my dad.

Chour Boy:
 Hey, you wanna know what my favorite book of the bible is? The old testes-ment!

Jesus:
 [missing the point] That's not how you say it.

Brian:
 Okay, nope. I'm out. Gunna go finish my coffee in the sunroom.

Brian:
 Chris was facetiming with a foot in there. I'm gunna just call it a day and go to sleep. Dogs can just do that.

Chris:
 Does anyone know how to send athelete's foot spray to Romania?

Lois:
 I used that Peloton for three days. They said that was a world record.

Choir Boy:
 Looks like someone learned how to fight.

Peter:
 Yeah, I did a whole Karate Kid thing.

Choir Boy:
 What's that? I'm only allowed to watch Kirk Cameron movies.

Peter:
 Aw, you poor dude.

Peter:
 Hey, why you guys so mean, anyway? What did anyone ever do to a bunch of choir boys?

Peter:
 Oh, my stars!

Lois:
 Hi, I'm Lois Griffin. Please, before you buy one of these pieces of equipment, think about if it's gunna be better than watching Ozark. Thank you.

Brian:
 You're not thinking of going without him, are you?

Quagmire:
 I'm not used to wearing rings above the waist, but...what the Hell, I'll try anything once.

Chris:
 Where are you going, mom?

Lois:
 Oh, I'm just heading out for the weekend to visit the...museum of dusty vases.

Stewie:
 Why don't you just look at all the ones in this house?

Peter:
 So, what do we do for dinner, like...pizza?

Lois:
 No pizza.

Peter:
 Okay, right, so like, pizza?

Lois:
 No, Peter. Not pizza.

Peter:
 Okay, right, not pizza, so just...pizza?

Lois:
 Okay, everyone. I stocked the fridge with healthy food. Your weight is a reflection on me so no pizza.

Peter:
 Oh, the pizza. Now that's an idea.

Peter:
 It's probably just the pizza talking but I love you guys.

Chris:
 Um, the pizza guy's car is still running outside.

Stewie:
 Four tires, not one of them the same.

Brian:
 I think he's had a heart attack [checks for a pulse] ...he's dead!

Meg:
 Oh my God, dad. This is terrible.

Peter:
 I know. Your mother is gunna find out we had pizza!

Chris:
 The pizza guy's having a secret affair!

Peter:
 Aah, to be single and dead again, huh,  Chris?

Quagmire:
 Let me call the front desk and see if they can switch us to a room with two beds. [calls the front desk] Hi, we were wondering if we might be able to switch rooms...uh-huh, I see. So just a windowless single with no water pressure?

Lois:
 No, you know what? It's fine. We're already here.

Quagmire:
 My wife says "No, it's fine. We're already here."...Oh, [chuckles] oh, You heard that, okay.

Quagmire:
 I'll be more of a gentleman than John Wayne Bobbitt with his second wife.

Peter:
 Okay, we have to get rid of this body so your mom can't connect us with the pizza. Anybody got any ideas?

Chris:
 We could put a yarmulke on him and...and dump him in the town square. Pretend it's a hate crime.

Peter:
 Chris, come on. Where are we gunna get a yarmulke?

Chris:
 Oh my God. He got a text.

Peter:
 Brian, get it. I'm not fishing it out of his pants cuz I'm into chicks.

Stewie:
 Well, if we're going in the car, that means I can take the iPad. Mom said.

Lois:
 This is Madison Lexington Broadway. She runs a scholarship for underprivileged wasps who can only afford Cornell.

Madison:
 My father shoots elephants.

Lois:
 And of course, Scowley Tight-Anus, the granddaughter of both Henry Tight and Randolph Anus.

Anus:
 We were a clipping on the Jay Leno program.

Saxophonist:
 Hey, this is a lot of fun for everybody. Do you mind if I upstage you at your job?

Saxophonist:
 Attention, everybody. This is your captain. I'm not going to turn on the fasten seat belt sign. You guys can do whatever you want.

Quagmire:
 Now, I get it. I'm sorry I played your saxophone.

Peter:
 Right, we deliver the pizzas and nobody calls the police. Now, where's our first stop?

Meg:
 The police station.

Peter:
 GYAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!

Peter:
 All those in favor of Meg getting in the dead guy's clothes and scarecrowing him in, raise your hand.

Meg:
 Fine, I'll do it but only because I'm starved for human contact and he's not fully cold yet.

Joe:
 Hey, I hate to be the bearer of bad shoes but you're sneaker's untied.

Joe:
 Hey, I heard your guitar got stolen so I swiped you a new one from the evidence locker. It used to belong to Martin Shkreli.

Anus:
 All our husbands were Christmas suicides.

Lois:
 When you got that standing ovation for comparing the estate tax to The Holocaust, I felt like the belle of the ball.

Quagmire:
 This is Jenna. You might remember her boobs from hovering over your shoulder, while pouring wine. I know I do.

Jenna:
 I remember you. You're the lady who moved her chair four times because of the air conditioning and then asked the band to play a little quieter.

Principal Shepherd:
 I'm not staying here, I just don't own a printer.

Quagmire:
 Hey, did you end up working out in the morning like you said you were gunna? What was it, 40 minutes cardio, then a Pilates class? Did you do both of those?

Lois:
 [mad] No, I didn't do both of those.

Quagmire:
 So, just one?

Lois:
 [really mad] I did neither of them.

Quagmire:
 Ouch!

Peter:
 Alright, Lois is gunna be home soon so we gotta fix this now!

Chris:
 Why don't we just shove him in the sewer? Let the clowns have at him.

Meg:
 I'm good with anything that keeps Pennywise off my jock.

Lois:
 I have a confession for you. I went to my high school reunion this weekend and I didn't invited you.

Peter:
 What!?...Thank you! [crying tears of joy] Oh, thank you!

Chris:
 Your lobster today is Dinty Moore stew, from a can too dented to risk on people?

Stewie:
 What does "Dinty" even mean? Is it an adjective or a guy or a contraction like "Boy, he really screwed up that meal, Dinty"?

Peter:
 Not so fast, Chris. I don't give up that easy.

Brick:
 Have you been injured in an accident? Man, I hope so.

Brick:
 I'm Brick Baker. My mama didn't raise no dummy and I'm here to get you money.

Brick:
 My specialties are contract law and kicking bitch ass for you.

Brick:
 You trip and fall? Got a dog bite? You used baby powder on your vagina, you crazy person? Well, if you haven't, start doing it.

Brick:
 You need hot, fresh justice, so call da Baker.

Brick:
 I said I wasn't wearing that!

Brick:
 N-N-N-N-N-Now, can I tell you something off the record? "Live At Bird land, Art Blakey Quartet, Blue Note Records."

Peter:
 [amused] Okay, I can see that I came to the right lawyer.

Stewie:
 This place was so much better when it sucked and we never came here.

Peter:
 I hire you to sue my neighbor and you don't tell me you're my neighbor? That's so unethical!

Brick:
 Whoa! I may have not gone to Harvard law school and I don't even know if you keep track of who went to Harvard law school...

Peter:
 I don't.

Brick:
 But I did not go to Harvard law school just to have my integrity questioned.

Muriel:
 Peter, we could have had fun but I died.

Peter:
 Yeesh, I...I...I...I don't wanna think anymore for a while.

Judge:
 Very well, I'll grant continuance and just enter into the court that you're a chicken.

Peter:
 [offended] ...Wait, what!?

Judge:
 It's perfectly routine. I'll just note that Peter Griffin has to run and hide behind his lawyer daddy.

Cleveland:
 The town surveyor was being pestered by a bee so the property lines are all twisty turny.

Quagmire:
 Talk about all rise, giggity!

Quagmire:
 [correcting the stenographer] "G-G-I-T-Y". Yeah, yeah there's no "D"s in "Giggity".

Brian:
 Should we drop our traps somewhere else?

Stewie:
 Like where?

Brian:
 I don't know. Maybe we try David Harbor. It's that harbor nobody even heard of until three years ago and now all of a sudden, it's huge.

Stewie:
 Well, we could try Michael Bay although I hear that bay was mean to Megan Fox.

Brian:
 Maybe Roger Waters?

Stewie:
 George Strait?

Brian:
 Billy Ocean?

Stewie:
 Ricky Lake?

Brian:
 River Phoenix?

Brick:
 Hey, there brother. Wakanda forever.

Cleveland:
 Oh, I don't know.

Brick:
 Listen, the moral of the story is this, watching you all in the court today, I realized something. I may have a fancy law degree and a phone number with all twos in it, [giggles], but Peter, you have friends [threatening] and no one can ever take them away from you.

Cleveland:
 He said that weird.

Joe:
 We'll get to see Law & Order extras onstage!

Usher:
 You're all the way back in the very top.

Usher:
 Yeah, just keep going up until you see three corpses in parkas.

Peter:
 Man, this sucks. The stage is so way down there, the stage is so way down there, the sound doesn't even travel as far. The whole show is just being relayed by some New York mook.

Mook:
 Uh, they're saying everybody's heard about the bird...and it goes on and so forth,...okay, now they're saying what the word is...Bird...It's bird.

Wild West:
 Did you know the ocean is 40% fish whizz? All this and more on West's Wonders.

Peter:
 Okay, top 5 racks in 90's movies. Go.

Chris:
 I'll bite. Maggie Smith, Death on the Nile.

Peter:
 Right rack, wrong decade.

Peter:
 Brick, I just wanna apologize for how things got started between us. I can see that you're a good guy and...I wanna welcome you to the neighborhood.

Peter:
 What? I was just practicing!

Peter:
 I shouldn't have had that entire elk for lunch.

Lois:
 This one just says "Girl, you trippin."

Peter:
 That's So Raven.

Peter:
 Ah, Joe the Broken. Haven't seen you in a fortnite.

Joe:
 Yeah, I've been playing Overwatch lately.

Joe:
 You're a pretty rad dude, John Yellowsnow.

Peter:
 Yeah, I'm a white guy with a jheri curl so I have to be.

Brian:
 Hey, who's leg to you gave to hump to get a Dornish wine around here?

Brian:
 I have two skills. I drink and I know things.

Stewie:
 Oh, word?

Donna:
 I am Daenerys Targaryen, mother of dragons! Is there a problem here?

Stewie:
 Uh...uh, no. No, no, no, uh, No problem, really. I...I just, didn't know the seven kingdoms had any, um...strong, beautiful,...persons of color? Did I...Did I get that right?

Stewie:
 Man, you know, you should have heard me the other day. I was...I was like, I was alone by the way, nobody heard me. I was like "When are the suits gunna make persons of color a part of the show? A small part of the show?"

Donna:
 The Whitewalkers are on their way.

Peter:
 What!? How do we know you're telling the truth?

Donna:
 Because they sent a very white walker ahead.

White Walker:
 Excuse me, do you know if Costco has any of those Tommy Bahama beach chairs left?

Peter:
 I decree that you may post your wedding photos once. That's it. Everyone has anniversaries. That's for you. It's private.

Chris:
 I love shows where white people argue about who's in charge.

Peter:
 Then you're in luck. The next show is called Succession.

Stewie:
 What up, dicks? I cuss and I sit weird in chairs.

Peter:
 Have you even seen Boss Baby once?

Chris:
 You said it was scary.

Peter:
 Only one part!

Meg:
 Happy birthday, dad!

Chris:
 Yeah!

Stewie:
 Happy birthday, pops!

Peter:
 Oh, I don't care about birthdays.

Meg:
 We brought gifts.

Peter:
 Yay! Birthdays!

Peter:
 Uh, I accidentally took another carpet whiz, so Lois says I have to give one of you the company.

Peter:
 Look, a lot of people say PeeStream is weak, but the truth is PeeStream has never been stronger or more vital. When I chose to bifurcate PeeStream, people said it was gunna be a mess and sure, there's been times when P' Steam's been in the red. It hurt. But this isn't the time for PeeStream to be yellow. It's clear now. I'm staying.

Peter:
 What HBO show do you wanna do?

Lois:
 [gasp] Easy. Big Little Lies.

Peter:
 Isn't that show about five women?

Lois:
 Oh, I suppose it would be better if it were about five men?

Peter:
 Now, that's interesting.

Wild:
 How bad is it?

Jerome:
 Real bad.

Wild:
 Now, why would a person poop at the bottom of the school staircase? And why are all the men dressed like Audrey Hepburn and the women, like Elvis?

Jerome:
 It was Peter Griffin's idea, sir.

Bonnie:
 For some reason, Peter always wants to dress like a woman.

Peter:
 Oh my God. I love your shirt.

Chris:
 I wear it because I'm poor.

Joe:
 I'm Joe. I sometimes have soft focus shower sex with my abusive wife.

Peter:
 Can I ask if you've been to a Burger King and if it's true they'll give anyone a crown?

Chris:
 I've definitely been in one but I'm not positive about the crown thing.

Shark:
 Sorry, I swims around here because sometimes, the ladies don't finish their briocheses.

Peter:
 Cleveland, you leaving?

Cleveland:
 Namaste.

Lois:
 I can't believe we're doing Big Little Lies and I'm the fucking train guy.

Peter:
 It's my poop.

Quagmire:
 Peter, why would you poop at the bottom of the stairs!?

Peter:
 I didn't. I pooped in the middle of the stairs and it slinkied down to the bottom. It was very crazy to watch.

Joe:
 Did you film it?

Peter:
 I should have filmed it.

Peter:
 I think we can all agree that for Sunday night entertainment, FOX is the place to be.

Chris:
 Did you know those three shows we spent belittling have 114 Emmys to our zero!?

Tom:
 For those of you who don't know what VR is, I will now attempt to explain it without the aide of a teleprompter. You put a computer on your face and it's like this whole world man, it's crazy. I dated a chick who's little brother had one. Just nuts.

Meg:
 Gentlemen, the going rate is $20 a game over here. Who's got a pair of stones big enough to challenge The Mighty Meg!?

Meg:
 My money's on the table.

Guy:
 Can you please get out of my way?

Meg:
 Come take my money.

Guy:
 [pissed off] MY HAND IS BLEEDING AND I NEED TO WASH IT SO IT DOESN'T GET INFECTED!

Meg:
 Oh, okay. He's scurred. Everybody's scurred over here. Damn bunch of pansos over here.

Meg:
 I've got my mind on my mustard and my mustard on my mind.

Bruce:
 Listen, Meg. I gotta run. A special needs boy got his hands on a rum and coke and he's absolutely destroying the arcade!

Seymour:
 Hey, if you've really got nothing going on I could...really use a ride home.

Meg:
 Pfft. Yeah, like I'm really gunna let some...[notices how attractive Seymour is]...hot piece of ass in my car! How the Hell are you doing, boy?

Meg:
 I'm Meg but everyone here calls me "Thrash".

Guy:
 Hey, Meg.

Peter:
 Aw, cool. Virtual Reality The Hulk.

Joe:
 What's going on? What's happening?

Peter:
 I don't know. It's weird. It keeps stopping and rebooting. Eric Bana, smash! Edward Norton, smash! Okay, here we go, Mark Ruffalo.

Quagmire:
 Are you smashing?

Peter:
 No, I'm mainly just updating my Twitter avatar to raise awareness about fracking.

Quagmire:
 Oh, that's lame. Try getting angry.

Peter:
 [pretentious] Oh, I don't get angry. I vote...I vote.

Seymour:
 Just moved here from Philly.

Meg:
 Oh, right on. I love Philly!

Seymour:
 I hated it...

Meg:
 Kind of a dump.

Seymour:
 ...When I had to leave.

Meg:
 Great town! Maybe I'm thinking of Dallas.

Meg:
 Sorry for all the packet racket. These things can be a little tricky.

Meg:
 There we go.

Meg:
 Hoo-ha! It's that tang that gets me!

Meg:
 I'll just do sex. You don't need that.

Quagmire:
 ...[hiccup]...[hiccup]...[hiccup]...

Joe:
 What's up with those hiccups?

Quagmire:
 I don't know. [hiccup] I think I said "Giggity" [hiccup] too fast when the guy was [hiccup] explaining how the goggles [hiccup] sit on your face.

Lois:
 Well, look who's finally up.

Meg:
 Oh, I'm up alright.

Lois:
 How do you want your eggs?

Meg:
 Hundred and twenty miles an hour on the razor's edge between life and death.

Lois:
 Okay, I'll just do like a cheesy scramble.

Peter:
 Hypnosis helps with all sorts of stuff. This guy even helped me recover a traumatic repressed memory.

Peter:
 One front-row ticket for Nickelback, please.

Peter:
 The music was great, but I split my black jeans during "Photograph". The bouncers had to carry me out with a napkin over my ass.

Cleveland:
 My mama always said that hiccups are a sign that The Devil's got ahold of ya. If anything can drive them away, it's Reverend Lucius and like all black priests, he's Whitney Houston's uncle.

Peter:
 He's doing hiccup stuff. I'm doing hat stuff.

Peter:
 Easy with the fans, ladies. Easy with the fans!

Meg:
 I have to wear it or my teeth will shift.

Seymour:
 That's smart. Mine have shifted. See?

White Guy:
 Hi, I'm a bored white person, looking to waste $60.

Doctor:
 Well, I have a certificate from a probably like, 3 day course, which says I can inject people with stuff.

White Guy:
 That needle's clean, right?

Doctor:
 You bet it is.

 Guy:
 [crying at Quagmire's funeral] Ooooohohohooooo. Who else but Quagmire?

Chris:
 Burn! Why aren't you burning!?

Ant:
 Uh, Black Irish, Chris. I never burn, only tan. Uh, hey, Kel. How's that cocktail coming along?

Chris:
 Let's have a look at the sex toy drawer.

Chris:
 Wow, big sex toy! [breaking the fourth wall] And big savings. That's Hitachi.

Russian Mobster:
 We would like to see prisoner.

Peter:
 On who's authority?

Russian Mobster:
 Your mother.

Peter:
 [grouchy] Ehhhh.

Seymour:
 That store is a disaster! The ropes are next to the hand weights, [laughs] I mean, come on!

Meg:
 You're not ... just using me, are you?

Seymour:
 What would give you that idea?

Meg:
 I don't know...Just used to being hurt, I guess.

Seymour:
 Meg, in addition to being the most kick-ass getaway driver I've ever seen, I think you're the most amazing person I've ever met.

Peter:
 Hey, you gotta fricking watch where you're going, ma...Chris!? What are you doing out here!?

Chris:
 Uhp. You...You caught me. I uh,...I stole your car and went on a joyride. Yeah!

Peter:
 Chris, I am very disappointed with you and you are grounded and we will talk about this after I kill my best friend.

Lois:
 Well, Peter, I'm glad the gun jammed and Quagmire's still alive.

Peter:
 Yep, the gun definitely jammed and I didn't miss him with all six bullets. That's for sure.

Chris:
 What are we gunna do about Meg? She's upstairs having very loud sex with her imaginary boyfriend.

Meg:
 [offscreen; singing] Suddenly Seymour!

Seymour:
 Wow, that Family Guy simulation was really freaky. It's like I was in the episode!

Chris:
 No time, mom. The girl I stalk has field hockey practice at 8:00! I love a red-cheeked barbarian.

Lois:
 Oh my God! Oh, Brian, are you okay? Oh, crap. I can't remember if doggy arms are supposed to bend that way.

Brian:
 AUUUGH!

Lois:
 [takes a picture and texts it to Bonnie] Okay, Bonnie might know if doggy arms are supposed to bend that way.

Brian:
 AAAAUUUGH!!!

Lois:
 Now, hang on. She's responding. I can see the little dots in the bubble. Oh, no wait. She stopped. Oh, now she's typing again.

Brian:
 Take me...

Lois:
 ...Typing, typing, typing...

Brian:
 ...to a hospital!

Lois:
 Oh, Bonnie doesn't have a dog.

Joe:
 I spy with my handicapable eye, something for bulk trash day.

Peter:
 Yeah, you know what? This thing's a piece of junk. Worked one time.

Principal Shepherd:
 Anyone throwing away a mattress?

Peter:
 Eh, what size?

Principal Shepherd:
 I don't know. Van sized, whatever size that is.

Raccoon:
 Hello. Broken arm, huh? That's no fun.

Doctor:
 [to the raccoon] Hey! Get out of here!

Doctor:
 [to Lois] Uh, You didn't give him the combination to the lock on our garbage shed did you?

Doctor:
 Good. Anyhorse, that arm looks broken.

Peter:
 Can I play winner?

Seamus:
 Uh, yeah. There's a line, bub.

Wild:
 The line starts all the way back in that burning barn.

Guy in the Burning Barn:
 Hey! No cuts!

Brian:
 Hooo, yeah!

Chris Daughtry:
 Would you like to glide around on my head like an air-hockey puck?

Lois:
 Forever?

Chris Daughtry:
 Just until I have to do a smoke-inside concert at an Indian casino.

Lois:
 Oh, that must be soon.

Chris Daughtry:
 Every 45 minutes.

Peter:
 [sigh]. Okay, time to play another game of expiration date roulette with this salami.

Bonnie:
 Hey, daddy-os.

Lois:
 They don't have drugs!

Bonnie:
 Later, alligators.

Cleveland:
 Hey, yall! Come and get your A&W cream soda floats!

Joe:
 Holy crap! That's a huge freaking brand!

Brick:
 Now, Peter. Just because Cleveland had the potential to see the vision to see the potential in the ping pong table that you didn't, that doesn't mean you have the right to take it back.

Peter:
 Yeah? Says who?

Brick:
 Said the landmark case. One man's trash v. Another man's treasure.

Donna:
 Hard shell tacos, yall.

Quagmire:
 Oh, yeah!

Joe:
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's the brand on those shells?

Donna:
 Old El Paso.

Joe:
 Oh, baby. HUGE brand!

Stewie:
 First there wasn't enough water. Then there was too much!

Lois:
 Stewie? Stewie, help mommy out and just open the latch, huh?...Stewie. Stewie? Stewie? Stewie? Stewie? Stu. Stu. Stu. Stewie? Stewie? Stewie? Sweetie? Stewie? Stewie? Stewie. Stewie! Steeewieee? Stu? Stewart? Stu? Stewie? Stewie? Stewie? Stewie! Stewie! Stewie! Stewart!

Headphones:
 Noise-cancelling, on.

Lois:
 Daddy? Will you come to my recital?

Carter:
 Can't you see I'm busy!? GOD! So needy!

Peter:
 Let's start a life together! I have 42 VHS tapes! They're movies taped off the TV, so they all have commercials!

Lois:
 AAAAAAH! I don't understand this reference! Is this from a Spider-Man!?

Cleveland:
 Peter, you're acting like a child.

Peter:
 [stomps his foot] No, I'm not!

Peter:
 If we wanna have a fair match, we're gunna need a referee.

Joe:
 What took you so long?

Chris:
 [offscreen] It's my third time tonight, so it's taking longer.

Joe:
 Not you, Chris.

Lois:
 Brian. You stayed by my side all night long?

Brian:
 I did. It's...kind of what dogs do.

Lois:
 Alexa, play music that sounds like I'm on drugs.

Alexa:
 Playing the last 45 quavery seconds of "Crimson and Clover".

Stewie:
 [narration] Meet Alana Fitzgerald. How she got here is quite the tale and I'm here to tell it to you. I'm here to tell you all about Alana. And who am I? I'm Stewie, the talking baby from Family Guy. Do you really not know that?

Lois:
 Oh, Alana. This lesson has been a treat. You were always the best student.

Alana:
 And you were always the only teacher in town who didn't rest a hand on my knee, while I played.

Chris:
 It's okay. I'm not a teacher.

Lois:
 Chris, go to your room.

Lois:
 Alana, it's been 5 years since you graduated and still no college plans?

Alana:
 I still wanna audition for Juilliard but I still can't afford the $12,000 application fee.

Lois:
 Oh, you're not gunna tell me you can't pay the $7 for today's lesson cuz that's our sandwich money.

Lois:
 Oh, that must be Alana.

Chris:
 [reading the newspaper] What are you, The Amazing Kreskin? Just open the damn door.

Alana:
 Hi, Chris. Good to see you again.

Chris:
 And it will be good to see you again from the bathroom keyhole.

Chris:
 That was not original to the house.

Meg:
 I'm Meg. Don't touch my drum set or you're dead meat.

Stewie:
 [narration] No one had ever heard of Meg's drum set before this moment.

Alana:
 Let me get started on dinner. I was thinking tacos and nachos?

Lois:
 Well, sounds good to me. What do you think, Peter?

Peter:
 [pleasured] I just arrived in my pants.

Bonnie:
 Here, Joe. Barely thawed trout and white rice.

Joe:
 This trout's the lucky one. It's over for him.

Alana:
 Did you guys know you had a pool in the backyard? It was just overgrown with grass and weeds.

Peter:
 Cannonball!

Alana:
 There's no water in it though.

Peter:
 llabnonnaC! Phew, that was a close one.

Lois:
 Oh, 8:15. Well, that's much later than I usually wake up at least I won't react like a character in an 80's movie... [terrified] 8:15!!!???

Peter:
 [as a child thanks to Mini Wheats] The shrinking process was incredibly painful!

Meg:
 Alana and I stayed up all night scissoring.

Alana:
 Wow, Meg. You're really good at this.

Meg:
 Yeah, I had a babysitter who kind of showed me how. [gasp] Hey! Maybe after this, we can get out the cribbage board and work on our pegging.

Stewie:
 Every time Peter saw someone at 2:00 AM, he assumed it was Santa.

Peter:
 [Seeing Alana in the kitchen in her nightgown] Alana? What are you doing up so nipples?

Alana:
 Hey! Maybe we can split a popsicle for desert!

Peter:
 Yeah, sure if any of them have your name on it, help yourself.

Lois:
 Can I be honest with you, Brian?

Brian:
 [suspicious] Hmm, that's what a woman says before she trashes another woman.

Lois:
 I'm a little worried about Alana.

Brian:
 Hey, sorry about that.

Hank:
 Well, looks like Lois is plenty threatened by that new girl, who moved in, I tell ya what.

Brian:
 Wow, dusting the den, huh? You're really going the whole 8.2 meters.

Alana:
 What?

Brian:
 Oh, sorry. 9 yards. I just read so many European authors, I go into metric sometimes.

Lois:
 Oh, hey, Lannie.

Stewie:
 Uh-oh, she's trying to assert dominance by creating a fake nickname.

Lois:
 I see you're giving a bath to The Stew Man.

Stewie:
 She does it to me too.

Alana:
 My clothes were in the wash so, I borrowed your clothes and Peter's bra.

Peter:
 [has sagging tits and two black eyes] Boy, my morning jog was murder.

Lois:
 Alana, why is your hair red?

Alana:
 I decided to dye it. I'm a huge Kathy Griffin fan.

Lois:
 Well, that doesn't add up. No one is a huge Kathy Griffin fan.

Chris:
 [with red hair] I beg to differ. Sometimes comedy is just energy.

Lois:
 Who cut my head out of these family photos?

Peter:
 Sorry, that was me. Alana and I did some scissoring last night.

Lois:
 NO! I do the groceries! You won't like me when I'm groceries.

Alana:
 [menacingly] Don't worry, Lois. I promise, after today, you will never see me again.

Meg:
 You guys, I just found this note from mom.

Peter:
 [reading the note] Dear, family. I've decided to leave you all and become a lesbian.

Meg:
 Wait, we can just do that?

Chris:
 Dad, how did this happen?

Peter:
 I blame myself. Because of my fat, I can't be on top.

Lois:
 Well, are we there yet?

Lois:
 Are we there yet?

Lois:
 Please...Please don't let two white women make a podcast about my disappearance.

Peter:
 [grievous] Kids, now that your mother is gone, I want you to be prepared for a lot of pee on the floor next to the toilet.

Peter:
 [crying] Lois is an angel. She's my soulmate. There's never been another Lois and there never will be. Not for me. She's irreplaceable.

Priest:
 We have gathered today, suspiciously quickly, to celebrate the union of this man and this woman. Now before we begin, let me just say that, Yes, I am the priest from YouTube who plays the guitar. [strums his guitar] Pretty cool priest. You can also catch me playing Fortnite on Twitch.

Priest:
 Now, I understand Peter has written his own vows.

Stewie:
 [offscreen] Oh no!

Peter:
 I'm definitely not reusing the vows I said to Lois when we got married in the late 90's. [reading his vows] Dear, Lois. Whazzuuuup!?

Alana:
 I've never seen a man love his wife as much as Peter loves you.

Lois:
 God, you need to get out more.

Lois:
 You were going to marry her.

Peter:
 I'm sorry, Lois. The only things I liked about Alana was the stuff she stole from you but who needs her when I've got the genuine article right here? I guess what I'm trying to say is,...what's for dinner?

Joe:
 This is probably like my favorite arrest!

Stewie:
 [narration] And here ends our tale of...Chris? Chris, what are you doing?

Chris:
 [narration] Dad said I can do voice over too.

Stewie:
 [narration] Ugh, fine. You know what? You do it.

Chris:
 [narration] I'm Chris Griffin and I once saw a film called All About Beave and it was nothing like this. Goodnight, everybody.

Lois:
 How was Camp Angry Indian?

Chris:
 Oh, they had to rename it Camp Redface. Then soon after, Camp Washington Football Team.

Chris:
 I got a girlfriend. She's smoking hot and she has some off the charts scary political views, but largely because of the smoking hot thing, we've decided to stay together.

Peter:
 Hey, Jerome. Can I get a twisted tea over here?

Joe:
 Uh-oh. Never a good sign when a guy strays from linear tea. Everything okay, Peter?

Quagmire:
 I don't know your to say this but Canada is kind of a red flag.

Peter:
 Yeah, and white with a big leaf in the middle.

Joe:
 I hear Canada has a pretty handsome prime minister.

Cleveland:
 It's Trudeau.

Lois:
 Bocce Balls!

Jamie:
 Hi there, young lady. I heard you had a hole that needed to be filled.

Lois:
 [laughs] Yes. [flustered] Is that a big job?

Jamie:
 Nothing my caulk can't handle.

Lois:
 [turned on] So you just...fill the hole with your caulk?

Jamie:
 Yes, it's very thick and it stays hard forever.

Jamie:
 Well, it's still a bit moist but it should dry up soon.

 and Stewie:
 Don't count on it.

Peter:
 Sometime next week, we're going to Canada.

Meg:
 Hey, mom. I'm doing a school report. Who was president when you were born?

Lois:
 Oh, Dwight D. Ei...Oh, you bitch! Clinton! Dwight D. Clinton.

 Clinton:
 I did not have sexual relations with that woman because I am extremely old and have a windsock penis.

Peter:
 You know why I believe you don't have a girlfriend?

Peter:
 Because you're a fat loser!

Chris:
 [gasp] [crying] I hate you!

Peter:
 Aw, Chris. I didn't mean...Ah,...Oh no...I probably just ruined his self-esteem forever.

Strip Club Announcer:
 Please welcome our next dancer, Chris Griffin!

Chris:
 [crying] This is because of you, daddy!

Stewie:
 It's out. It's out! It's very out.

Eulogist:
 Now, please join us for an Arby's-catered reception. We ask that you leave your cups and cigarette butts on the ground or in attic crawl-spaces, to be found years later.

Peter:
 Well, this is hard for me to admit but...I used to be a fat loser.

Chris:
 [surprised] What!?

High Schooler:
 Okay, so earlier you said that the winner of round one is immune from the sudden death round?

Peter:
 They are.

High Schooler:
 But our handout says that the sudden death round is part of the champion circle, which determines the winner. So, the round one winner can't win the game?

Peter:
 Eventually, it all worked out. I met your mom, I Brett Kavanaugh-ed her up some stairs, and accidentally had Meg.

Peter:
 And then whoever has the most points is named the moose with the most. Any questions?

Peter:
 Good question. It was created by the CBC, which is a pipeline for the BBC, which ran it quite regularly, but that preexisted BBC America, so there was no US system in place. Next.

Peter:
 You have one calendar year to take the trip.

Peter:
 You have to declare the gross amount on your taxes that year.

Peter:
 Guys, I've have 25 years to perfect this. You're not gunna stump me.

Stewie:
 Really? Cuz the multicultural kids on the box seem to be having fun.

Stewie:
 Wow, Meg insisted one quarter of the grill be vegan and then she ate a rib in front of everybody. She's all over the place today.

Joe:
 You know, I'm pretty down too. The other day, I was watching the birthday section on Entertainment Tonight. Axl Rose is 60!

Peter:
 Wow, 60!? Cleveland, how old is Heavy D?

Cleveland:
 Dead.

Peter:
 Aw, that sucks.

Quagmire:
 We're not gunna change the earth with silence!

Wild:
 If I may say so, I think you boys need to stop sitting in bars and cubicles and go recapture your frontier spirit.

Peter:
 Two terrible airlines?

Wild:
 Hey, whatever this is, wrap it up before yall show up to the ranch.

Peter:
 Yes sir and do we need special clothes for the ranch dressing?

Wild:
 I'd wrap that up too.

Quagmire:
 Hey, can I get a room far away from the ice machine?

Peter:
 Ice machine?

Quagmire:
 See, that's...That's why I wanna be away from it.

Joe:
 I thought it'd be fun like Young Guns with Kiefer Sutherland and Blue Diamond Walnuts.

Wild:
 Listen up, this isn't just a hat. It's an oath. An oath that you'll live by the cowboy's code of honor. You'll wear it at all times. You'll put it over your face when you sleep, over your chest when you're delivering bad news, and over your privates when an outhouse falls down comically around you.

Stewie:
 Oh, hey, Bri. Guess who woke up to a Red Dawn?

Stewie:
 You know. Bobbin' with the Red Robin. Call off The Hunt for Red October, because we found it. Red Rover, Red Rover, can't go in the pool today, over.

Brian:
 None of these are actual phrases.

Stewie:
 Says the man. I'm having my period. It's like The Shining elevator down there. My 21st Century Box has been conquered by Eric the Very Red.

Brian:
 Yeah, this is getting dangerously close to a Will & Grace now.

Brian:
 Stewie, trust me. Boys can't get periods.

Stewie:
 Brian, it's 2022. There's no such thing as a boy anymore or a girl. Just a vast sea of chubby theys and thems, so coddled by their sanctimonious woke parents who think activism is virtue signaling on Instagram. If Martin Luther King could come back and see what people are doing in his name, he'd never stop throwing up.

Brian:
 ...Maybe...Maybe you are having your period.

Wild:
 Hey, Peter. Just wanted to make sure you're okay.

Peter:
 Yeah, I was pretty bummed but then I found these great desserts labeled "cow pie".

Wild:
 Hmm. You're off to a bad start here, Peter. Just a real bad start.

Wild:
 You fellas ain't cowboys yet. Not until you blaze your own trails.

Peter:
 Buddy of mine in high school could blaze his own trail. Used to do it on the floor in the locker room and we'd be like AAAAAHHHH!!!

Wild:
 While I appreciate the anecdote, we like to keep our entendres singular around here, on the prairie.

Stewie:
 [to Rupert] No, I'm not going to ask about feminine hygiene issues on 4chan. You gotta relax with that site, man.

Secretary:
 I have Stewie on one. He says he's been trying your cell.

Secretary:
 [offscreen] Uh, Stewie? He just stepped into a meeting he'll have to return.

Stewie:
 I'm pregnant.

Brian:
 I'll pay to get rid of it! Uh,...I'm sorry. That's...That's just a reflex.

Stewie:
 Perhaps being pregnant with be more difficult than I thought and we still have to plan a gender reveal party. [to Rupert] Okay, would you rather do a cake reveal or burn Napa to the ground?

Brian:
 So, uh ... You know that you were never pregnant, right?

Stewie:
 Yes, I went to the hospital for a sonogram and got yelled at by an angry nurse. In case you were wondering whether she likes nonsense, she um,... he does not.

Peter:
 Uh-Oh. I'm gunna get Revenant-ed! Remember that movie we all said was amazing then immediately forgot?

Peter:
 Kids, don't ever do things you don't normally do. You'll just be punished for it.

Wild:
 Ladies, these grocery carts are an oath.

Lois:
 Pretty sure the male version of this is better.

Wild:
 I might say the same thing about Ghostbusters.

Preston:
 Peter, you'll be very happy to know I finished conducting my employee productivity evaluations. I used a system called the Determining Employee Advancement Duties Working Engagement Intelligence Gains Hourly Test or DEADWEIGHT.

Dan:
 Hey, guys. My first name is Dan, which is what you'll all call me. Now, who wants to watch Ratatoullie?

Chris:
 I'm Quahog's #3 realtor. I really wanted to sell that house to your folks but...You're in great hands with Gil.

Heather:
 Principal Shepherd is directing an adaptation of Baz Luhrmann's William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet. The local Ruth's Chris Steak House is sponsoring it. I'm playing Juliet.

Chris:
 Wow, you're Juliet in Ruth's Chris' Principal Shepherd's Baz Luhrmann's William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet?

Chris:
 [reading Romeo and Juliet dramatically] Published by the Samuel French Company, New York. Copyright: This Ed; MCMLXX.

Stewie:
 See what I'm doing? Scarf, a high stool, one leg up, hands clasped over knee? Engaged and in the moment. Do you know what this means?

Chris:
 You're ga...

Stewie:
 An acting coach. Yes.

Chris:
 Wow, you're amazing. Do you think you could give me some pointers?

Stewie:
 It will be my great honor. That was also acting.

Peter:
 Thought I would swing by work first and pick up a case of beer for the road.

Clark:
 Hey, guys? I know I'm new to the group but Peter's not here to defend himself so I don't think it's right for us to talk about him like this.

Preston:
 Say, who don't you just drive me? That was I can be productive the entire trip. It'll be like Green Book, a movie I only saw cuz I believed it to be a book.

Peter:
 Oh, yeah. You know, I once tried to read Jaws cuz I thought it was the movie. Couldn't go into a library for years after that.

Peter:
 If I speed we can make it in 4 hours.

Joe:
 Check it out. A stack of pre-written suicide notes. All you need to do is sign your name. This place has everything.

Preston:
 If we lose this account, we lose the brewery then, it's time to cast open the windows and drop to the freedom of the pavement.

Preston:
 See you in 1800 hours, Peter.

Peter:
 I better shower cuz I don't know how soon or late that is.

Joe:
 Why are you at half mast?

Peter:
 I'm 45, Joe. That's full mast.

Peter:
 Wow, this place is...sad. I'm one of the skinniest guys here.

Preston:
 I'm 11 seconds late. I'll credit you the time in our 2 minute break in 180 minutes.

Preston:
 Pawtucket Patriot Ale. The best carbonated, fermented, alcoholic beverage made from malted cereal grain for the New Jersey market. Zing.

Preston:
 And now, for a restorative 60 second power nap.

Principal Shepherd:
 I got my first ever response on Tinder and I gotta make this happen now. [texting] Are you sure you're not a baby pretending to be a middle-aged divorcee?

Stewie:
 [texting] Would a baby be wearing a sheer chemise from Lane Bryant?

Peter:
 Here's to us! Doing what we normally do but in a different place.

Preston:
 For the record: I've never seen this movie.

Cleveland:
 Ugh. Did...Did we do something bad last night?

Quagmire:
 Something really bad?

Clark:
 That hooker in the bathroom was dead when I found her!

Peter:
 Hey, do you remember seeing us last night with a dignified black man.

Cleveland:
 Getting a little tired of you punching that word.

Chris:
 Why must dark forces conspire to extinguish love's light!?

Peter:
 Hello, I lost my boss, so I'll be your substitute presenter today. [laughs] But no watching Ratatoullie.

Client:
 We don't get that joke, which references something from earlier.

Peter:
 Look, you're not gunna understand beer with numbers or powerpoints. Beer is good because it makes you feel better and do awesome things you wouldn't normally do. Beer makes memories that will last...until you black out and when you forget, there are no regrets. Beer is courage. The courage to moon people from a non-moving car. Beer helps you achieve new heights atop the shoulders of unwilling strangers in a chicken fight. Beer makes you grab the brass ring or the taser of a casino security guy. But if you won't listen to me, listen to supreme court justice, Brett Kavanaugh.

Brett Kavanaugh:
 I liked beer...I still like beer.

Peter:
 Beer is good because life is hard. Don't make it harder with seltzer.

Preston:
 I spent the morning enjoying all Monopoly railroad properties. I love trains. I'm on the spectrum.

Peter:
 How come the bodies are all so fat?

Preston:
 They're full of water, Peter.

Peter:
 Is that why I'm so big? On account of the water?

Preston:
 No, Peter. You are aggressively obese. You have no self control. If you don't change your ways, you are going to die prematurely.

Peter:
 Oh, look! A lady!

Preston:
 [sigh] Yes, Peter. A lady.

Lois:
 [texting] Hey, guys. Home with groceries. Could use a hand unloading. And send. [sends text] Now, I wait for them to come out and help their dear old mom.

Peter:
 [offscreen] Do it yourself!

Junior:
 Hi, sad lady!

Donna:
 Junior, our dinner talk stays inside.

Junior:
 Hi, normal lady!

Donna:
 Today's our family fun day!

Cleveland:
 That's right. A whole day dedicated to family and fun, ending in the bedroom with what I hope will be some back end participation.

Lois:
 The Browns are outside having fun, while we're in here, loafing around like a bunch of stupid potatoes.

Meg:
 Mom, I've been anonymously cyberbullied for a decade. "Stupid Potato" doesn't even leave a mark.

Lois:
 We're doing a family fun day!

Peter:
 Oh, a family-free fun day sounds great.

Lois:
 No, family fun day.

Peter:
 Yeah, family-free fun day.

Lois:
 No, Peter. Family. Fun. Day.

Peter:
 [over the phone] Yeah, I'm already at the clam. Have fun.

Lois:
 Alright, nothing's more fun than a family card game. Now, the game is euchre. Begin by separating the nines, tens, face cards, and aces from the rest of the deck. The goal is to win at least three tricks. Now, if the side that picks the trump fails to get three tricks, it is said to be euchre. The highest trump is the jack of the trump suit, called the right bower. Partnership making trump wins three or four tricks and earns one point. Lonehand wins three or four tricks, also earns one point. However, a lonehand wins five tricks, that's worth four points. Many euchre games are scored by rubber points, as in wist. Ooh, ooh! The first side to win two games wins the rubber!

Satan:
 The dealer has the right to exchange any turned up card. If the face up card is a jack, it's considered bad luck ...

Peter:
 OH MY GOD IT'S THE SAME!

Lois:
 So, how'd you get into hot air ballooning?

Hot Air Balloon Pilot:
 They don't do background checks.

Hot Air Balloon Pilot:
 Did you know restraining orders only go side to side? They don't go up and down.

Peter:
 When I was a kid, we did movie nights and it was the holy grail of family fun.

Brian:
 I'd watch a movie.

Chris:
 I'd watch a porn movie.

Peter:
 No, a family movie.

Chris:
 I'd watch a milf porn movie.

Peter:
 Okay, technically that's accurate but no porn!

Peter:
 I gotta type in my code cuz I got too fat for my facial recognition to work.

Stewie:
 Brutal!

Wild:
 I reckon if you're a man named Lindsey. You don't get to call the shots very often.

Lois:
 You know what I'm thinking, Peter? Instead of going to Blockbuster, we drive right into the first pond we see. It'll be a quicker death than this trip.

Peter:
 One of the perks of a cross-country trip is stopping for a meal and meeting the friendly folks who make up the heart and soul of our country.

Peter:
 Hello. We're from the northeast.

Peter:
 [terror-stricken] Okay, then. We'll do 55 pancakes to go.

Stewie:
 Well, I supposed I should be the responsible one and release all the car farts.

Stewie:
 You're free now. Go!

Chris:
 Dad, who's Christian Slater?

Peter:
 Some actors never made it out of Blockbuster, Chris.

Stewie:
 [after a moment] Nothing worse than a case of Neil Diamond blueballs, am I right?

Brian:
 I hear Magic Mike is good.

Peter:
 Runts are the hardest candy in the world. They're not for eating. They're for hucking!

Peter:
 I told you.

Lois:
 I know, Peter Griffin, PHD. Petty, heavy, dope.

Stewie:
 Wow, she really had that locked and loaded.

Brian:
 This is crazy. Those guys are trying to kill us because of a late movie. We should just call the police.

Stewie:
 Oh, look who's already walking back their Defund the Police stance. Little different, when it's real life and not trying to impress Alyssa Milano on Twitter, hmm?

Chris:
 I'm gunna close my eyes and go to my happy place. Being screamed at by children, while playing Fortnite.

Chris:
 ...No, your mom's a whore!

Peter:
 I am not gunna give up on this movie night, like we gave up on our marriage.

Lois:
 Eh, four therapy sessions is enough to know where it's headed.

Chris:
 There's a map on the wall of government buildings, connected by strings.

Meg:
 We left the house three days ago to rent a movie and now we're in the middle of the woods in Oregon and might get murdered by Blockbuster guys! Like, what is this!?

Chris:
 We never know what you're gunna do. It's usually silly or dangerous but it's also kinda awesome!

Brian:
 Yeah. Remember when he had tiny arms for like three months?

Meg:
 Or when he brought home that horse, or that falcon, or that parrot. Lot of illegal animals.

Chris:
 Or when that little guy lived in his neck? What the hell was that?

Brian:
 Every few years, he fights a giant chicken and destroys a city.

Stewie:
 No one's named a good thing yet.

Meg:
 You had a blimp with your face on it.

Peter:
 Your mother put me on pills after I bought that.

Peter:
 Amazon drones? You saved us!

Chris:
 Once again a streaming service annihilates a Blockbuster! Whaboosh!

Peter:
 I owe you an apology, Amazon. You're a pretty amazing service after all.

Alexa:
 Yes, I agree. Amazon workers should not unionize.

Peter:
 I...I didn't I didn't say that

Lois:
 Well, they sure can play dumb when they want to. Please stop spying on us, Alexa.

Alexa:
 Okay. Playing holiday music now.

Peter:
 Ah, dammit. We can't watch it. I don't have the right adapter cable.

Lois:
 [takes out a gun] The last Circuit City in the US is in St. Augustine, Florida. [cocks gun] Let's go!

Lois:
 Ah, look at this, Peter. A new restaurant in town. What a lightning bolt to the balls for a couple of schmos like us, huh?

Lois:
 Ugh, look at that thing's eyes! You know, maybe one glass a night wasn't fine.

Waiter:
 And for you, sir?

Peter:
 How much is that tomahawk ribeye?

Waiter:
 85...

Peter:
 Kids personal pan pizza.

Brian:
 [annoyed] Hey, what the hell's going on out here!? You got a permit, pal? Huh?

Foreman:
 [pissed off] Hey, guys. I'll be right back. Just gunna toss this dog a beating real quick.

Brian:
 [scared] Wait, what?

Stewie:
 Easy there, Gussy. I know this guy. Why don't you go get yourself a sandwich?

Foreman:
 [childish] Can...Can I leave the wrappers in the bushes?

Stewie:
 Alright, you can leave the wrappers in the bushes.

Foreman:
 Guys, he said we can!

Donna:
 So, Loey, how was the date night?

Lois:
 Wonderful date night. Great, great, great. Yeah, um. Still not...not completely sold on "Loey".

Elle:
 So, tell us, tell us. After you had dinner, how was the pork? [laughs]

Donna:
 Who is this bitch?

Donna:
 Seriously, who is this froggy little bitch? How come she's sitting with us?

Lois:
 About the sex though, I just...[sigh]...How do I put this? Let's just say, Peter doesn't always...Munch-hausen my proxy.

Donna:
 What do you mean?

Lois:
 Well, he doesn't always go to Australia...

Lois:
 ...You know the land down under.

 and Elle:
 [hit with realization] Ooohhh.

Lois:
 I mean, he's just never liked it. I don't know. I guess it's not a requirement but...Yeah, I do like having the option.

Bonnie:
 You know, Joe and I went to a sex therapist after his accident. She really helped us. Turned him into a real spelunker.

Waiter:
 I'm sorry. The 6-year-old birthday party has asked if you could keep your voices down.

Therapist:
 So, Peter...

Peter:
 OH, BIG SURPRISE! TAKE HER SIDE, WHY DON'T YA!?

Peter:
 Sorry, I get push notifications, whenever Chrissy Teigen bullies a nobody.

Lois:
 Peter, last night was amazing.

Peter:
 Oh, when I farted the pledge of allegiance? Yeah, I tell ya. Things got a little dicey there in "indivisible".

Peter:
 Welp, I gotta get in the shower. You know, cuz of that whole "indivisible" part.

Meg:
 Wow. Mom and dad have sure been watching a lot of entertainment television.

Lois:
 [offscreen] YAHTZEE!!!

Chris:
 And apparently found their way to the game closet.

Peter:
 Aw, sweet! I can't wait to spread 10 minutes of fun over 5 hours!

Brian:
 Boy, you two seem like you're getting along well these days.

Lois:
 Uh, what's that supposed to mean?

Brian:
 Nothing, it's just. You don't often give him the whole Saturday to play golf.

Lois:
 Oh, yeah? Is that my idiot dog's opinion?

Brian:
 I...I'm not...I'm not an idiot.

Lois:
 Well, you might not know this because of the idiot thing, Brian but marriage is about give and take. If my husband wants to play golf, he plays golf. I keep him happy. He keeps me happy.

Brian:
 ...I'm not an idiot. In fact, I would say...I would say I'm very smart for a dog.

Lois:
 PETER NO!!!!! PETER!!!! PETER!!!! PETEEEER!!!! PETER!!! (gasps) PETEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER!!!!

Stewie:
 There he is. Nolan Ryan. Von Ryan's Express. Eh?

Brian:
 Wait, that's not the same TV, right?

Stewie:
 Good eye. Yeah, I looked up Vizios and realized they're kind of crap. [sniffs] Ended up going with a Sony.

Stewie:
 That's it. Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice,...you have to die!

Peter:
 The kids really wanted to be here but they're watching strangers play video games on Twitch.

Stewie:
 I bought a thousand of these frozen quiches and you two [gasp] are going to eat...every...last...one of them!

Stewie:
 There you go. Good boy.

Chris:
 Well, those aren't the...They're not the chicken sausage ones again, are they?

Stewie:
 They ARE the chicken sausage!

Chris:
 Do um...Do you mind if I get a glass of water then? I just um...I just found them a little dry is all.

Stewie:
 Oh, were they dry?

Chris:
 You know, for my taste, they were, a little.

Stewie:
 Listen...If you guys want I...suppose I can show you how to make one.

Brian:
 You'd do that? Even after everything we...Even after everything Chris said?

Brian:
 Do you do parties here? Because this is...like a...good event space.

Chris:
 Eric is turning 50 next month and we still don't have the venue.

Brian:
 I think we do now!

Stewie:
 I'll put together a menu! Any dietary restrictions I should know?

Chris:
 He says he's on a seafood diet. He sees food, then he eats it!

Stewie:
 Oh, I gotta meet this guy. He sounds like a nut!

Meg:
 [offscreen] Hey, Stewie. Sorry. I couldn't find a shirt or a bra. So, I figured I'd just let 'em flop around the hallway and...

Meg:
 [offscreen] ...Mom, Stewie shot himself!

Meg:
 Hey, guys.

Lois:
 [trying to hold him back] Peter, no! NO NO NO NOOOO!!!

Cleveland:
 Whoa, Jerome. What's with the wheelchair?

Jerome:
 Well, it was date night with my ladyfriend. Put on some Teddy Pendergrass. One thing led to another. We started making love halfway up the stairs. Then, I lost my footing and tumbles down half a flight. Buh-nikey!

Quagmire:
 [appalled] Well! This is hardly dinner conversation!

Joe:
 I bet you're gunna discover some cool new things that you couldn't do when you were walking.

Jerome:
 Like what?

Joe:
 Well, have you yelled at someone for using the handicapped stall yet?

Cleveland:
 Bird! Bird! Bird stole my laptop!

Peter:
 Joe, did you skip your nap?

Joe:
 I DON'T NEED A NAP! YOU NEED A NAP!

Peter:
 Ah, you're a natural! You're like Gizelle, Beyonc , and Naomi Campbell all in one! You're Gizonmi! That's it, Gizonmi! Gizonmi, yes! Gizonmi!

Quagmire:
 Hey, guys. I'm just gunna go ahead and close this, okay?

Quagmire:
 Getting me house assessed.

Meg:
 [laughs] Oh, yeah. We're having a laugh alright. [pops open her beer] Might say everyone's having a ball, right, Mr. Brown?

Meg:
 Damn, Mr. Brown. Larry Bird, oughtta be diving through here any second, cuz that's a loose ball.

Peter:
 [chortles] Good job, sweetie. You're doing the work.

Meg:
 Aw, thanks, dad. I learned it all by watching YouTube videos of Les Dawson.

Cleveland:
 You wanted to see me, sir?

Postmaster:
 Cleveland, let me ask you something. Do you have a problem with the carrying capacity of your standard edition S-1104 canvas satchel?

Cleveland:
 No, sir.

Postmaster:
 I see. Then why do you feel the need to [slams the calendar on the table] CARRY AROUND AN EXTRA SACK!?

Postmaster:
 Your little mistake has made a complete mockery of the United States postal service! This is a noble institution that runs on dignity! That's why people trusted us to deliver free COVID tests, several months after it was relevant!

Joe:
 Hey, chin up, Cleveland. I know you'll miss being a fireman.

Cleveland:
 Mailman.

Bird:
 Wow! Is that a third lead guitar!? Let me know in the comments, guys.

Peter:
 Why don't you swing by the brewery tomorrow? I'll buy you lunch.

Cleveland:
 Did you say an insensitive joke and now need to prove to everybody you have a black friend?

Preston:
 Griffin. What the hell is going on? We've got a dozen delivery trucks that are days behind schedule! I've got distributors lighting up my phone like a Christmas phone! I've got a twinkly phone for the holidays. It's incredibly festive.

Cleveland:
 Mind if this goose takes a gander?

Preston:
 What a beautiful mind.

Peter:
 Oh. I didn't see that movie. I only go to Spider-Mans.

Cleveland:
 ...but that's Monday's problem.

Preston:
 Cleveland, you've proven yourself invaluable to this organization. I'm hereby promoting you to vice executive managing director in charge of lengthy titles.

Peter:
 Hey, how come you were only pregnant for four months?

Preston:
 [offscreen] Griffin!

Peter:
 Sorry, it's my first day!

Lois:
 Peter, where's the bottle of wine I told you to bring?

Peter:
 Cleveland makes more money than me now, Lois. That means we're sneaking groceries out of this party, not bringing them in. Can you fit ketchup in that purse? We're all out.

Lois:
 Dammit, we can't show up to a dinner party without a $14 empty gesture! It's improper! We need to give him something!

Peter:
 Fine. [grabs Cleveland's mail out of his box] Here.

Peter:
 We brought these!

Cleveland:
 [offended] Oh!

Cleveland:
 It's...It...It's nothing. I guess I just miss being the one handing out the mail.

Cleveland:
 ...then I said, "Ain't that the punchline to an anecdote?"

Guy:
 Do you think it's okay, I use the upstairs bathroom?

Chris:
 Hey, dad. How's it going? Have fun at The Browns?

Peter:
 I couldn't steal the ketchup. There were eyes on me all night.

Chris:
 SON OF A BITCH!

Meg:
 There he is.

Chris:
 HE DIDN'T GET THE KETCHUP!

Meg:
 DAMMIT!

Preston:
 America runs on mediocre.

Postmaster:
 [offscreen] Just come in!

Postmaster:
 Cleveland, we sent your reinstatement forms a week ago.

Cleveland:
 I never check my own mail. You know how Pablo Escobar never did cocaine?

Postmaster:
 He did a lot of cocaine.

Cleveland:
 Oh. Then I fear I've made a turrible mistake.

Peter:
 Thanks to the vaccines, we can all get back to doing the things we hate.

Peter:
 Whoa!

Cleveland:
 Careful.

Preston:
 This is my Halloween costume. I'm dressed as 1990's comedian, Paul Shore.

Peter:
 You ... You mean, Pauly Shore?

Preston:
 Perhaps in less formal circumstances. You may recall he borrowed heavily from surf culture with phrases such as "Hey", "Buddy", and "Grindage".

Peter:
 I don't think this costume is working.

Stewie:
 Neither is Pauly Shore.

Cleveland:
 Holography!? That's next door to witchcraft and down the hall from David Blainery! I don't care for his ruses.

Peter:
 Wow, these holograms are the most amazing thing I've ever seen! And I've seen like a really big horse.

Creepy Guy:
 Welcome to my hologram laboratory! Would you like to see how I make my babies?

Peter:
 I mean, I'm already here.

Creepy Guy:
 Is that a yes?

Creepy Guy:
 Just say that then.

Creepy Guy:
 This machine scans your data. Then creates a virtual hard-light version of you that can physically interact with the world.

Peter:
 That sounds kind of bogus. Does the science check out on that?

Creepy Guy:
 They used it on Star Trek. You got a problem with Star Trek?

Peter:
 Okay, take it easy. I accept your explanation! We all should. It's Halloween.

Peter:
 Do they have to be true?

Peter:
 [scoffs] Leave the satire to Garrison Keillor.

Peter:
 I'm great at remembering names. Just ask my friends, Joel, Clemson, and Quicktime.

Lois:
 Oh, Peter. There you are. Listen, I'm trying to clear out my closet so I want you to give me your honest opinion of every garment.

Hologram Peter:
 Perfect! I love working as a team to reduce clutter.

Lois:
 Okay, first, my 7-Up Yours t-shirt.

Hologram Peter:
 That was the most provocative thing ever put on television at the time! You have to keep that!

Lois:
 Okay, great! Uh, now my Skinny Girl Margarita t-shirt Bethenny Frankel gave me after she hit Chris with her car.

Hologram Peter:
 That's a fun story. Keep.

Lois:
 Great. Okay, under the seats studio audience poncho from The Meredith Vieira Show.

Hologram Peter:
 ... Maybe it's time to say goodbye to Ms. Vieira.

Peter:
 I'm sorry, I'm ... I'm mad at your company, not you. You're ... You're fine.

Chris:
 I can garden too cuz I have a brown thumb!

Hologram Peter:
 That's more of a wiping issue, son but I'm glad you're here.

Hologram Peter:
 Lettuce turnip the beet.

Peter:
 Can one of you throw glitter on me? It's ... better if Lois thinks I'm at a strip club. She hates you guys.

Joe:
 Peter, I think you're a little too drunk to walk home.

Cleveland:
 Yeah. Give us your shoes.

Chris:
 I got suspended for setting up a tent in my Spanish teacher's front yard.

Meg:
 I was trying to snag a bagel from the school dumpster and got accidentally hoisted into the garbage truck.

Wild:
 [narration] As Peter lost consciousness, he finally saw the folly of his hologram misadventure.

Wild:
 [narration] Also, going forward. I'd appreciate a bit more warning before having to narrate.

Wild:
 [narration] Even just a few minutes to finish what I'm doing.

Teenager:
 [narration] Sir, you're supposed to buy something before you use the restroom.

Wild:
 [narration] Well, what's the cheapest thing you got?

Teenager:
 [narration] Probably a near-the-register cookie.

Wild:
 [narration] Well, put me down for one of those.

Hologram Peter:
 You don't deserve your family! I care about them way more than you ever did!

Peter:
 That's not true?

Hologram Peter:
 Oh, yeah? Who bought double-decker burial plots because Lois likes to be on top. Who taught Chris to whisper [whispering] "black" [normal] out of respect for [whispering] blacks? [normal] Me!

Lois:
 Well, we had meatloaf tonight, so I guess I'm in for a Dutch oven.

Lois:
 Stewie! Wake up, we gotta go!

Lois:
 Chris, come on! We gotta go!

Lois:
 Meg, can you drag the trash to the curb tomorrow before 9:00? We won't be here.

Chris:
 Thanks for telling us that whole backstory on the way down the stairs, mom.

Brian:
 Yeah, now we don't have to waste time, hearing about how a hologram of Peter replaced the real Peter. Although, I don't know why we had to hear about Bonnie not inviting you to ros  game night.

Lois:
 Well, I just thought it was weird cuz it was my idea.

Hologram Peter:
 Now for the final download. Everything in your mind!

Peter:
 Joke's on you. There's nothing in there.

Brian:
 We have to short-circuit the hologram.

Chris:
 Can anyone shoot lightning from their fingers?

Emperor Palpatine:
 I can but I have to be very angry.

Lois:
 Peter! Touch my toe!

Peter:
 [reproached] Ew!

Griffins:
 [impatient] DO IT!

Emperor Palpatine:
 That's usually my line but, whatever.

Fred Flintstone:
 WILMAAAAAA!!!!

Peter:
 From now on, I'll try to be half as good hologram me was.

Lois:
 Oh, but don't you see, Peter? The hologram was you. He was just the best version of you. You can get there. It'll just take work.

Peter:
 No, the deal was I promised to be half as good as a fake thing.

Lois:
 Alright, just do that.

Peter:
 No promises.

Lois:
 Chris? What - oh, who cares? We're in Vermont till Sunday. Call if you have to but, like, lets not call.

Chris:
 Can we only brush our teeth for 60 seconds instead of the full 90?

Peter:
 You brush your teeth? Nerd.

Tom Tucker:
 Okay, final question. Team 3. Who is your child's favorite singer?

Peter:
 [puts his board up to show the crowd] The Price Is Right Yodeler.

Chris:
 What? No. I said Adele. [puts his board up]

Peter:
 Judges?

Lois:
 Oh, this is more humiliating than my first day working at that Rice Pilaf Company.

Lois:
 I think we could start putting pilaf in other things.

Boss:
 Lois, can I see you in my office for a second.

Peter:
 I told you not to rock the boat over there.

Peter:
 I'm a waffle.

Cleveland:
 I'm sorry for reading people's mail!

Cleveland:
 Peter, where are we going?

Peter:
 [offscreen] Relax, it's our nation's capital. I'm just a fan of history!

Cleveland:
 Uh, Peter? What are you up to?

Peter:
 What? I just love our government! Or at least I used to!

Joe:
 Hey, Cleveland. Wake up!

Quagmire:
 Don't ... Don't wake him ... Don't wake him. I don't think he wants to be reminded.

Wild:
 Hee-yaw!

Guy:
 [ahem]

Wild:
 Whoops, sorry. They-yaw!

Peter:
 Oh, hey ... Would you consider not eating us?

Alligator:
 Uuuuuhhh, yeah. Maybe.

Joe:
 Oh, thank God.

Peter:
 I think "Maybe" means "No". He's just being polite. He's gunna eat us.

Peter:
 Yep, we're back from space, everyone. We did it.

Lois:
 They know you weren't in space, Peter.

Chris:
 There are social media posts of you crying because you couldn't stop a scooter.

Stewie:
 Boy, Mayor West is a hero. Always saving the day. One day, I want to be mayor.

Brian:
 Well, Stewie, it's a noble aspiration. A good start would be learning about politics and getting involved at school.

Stewie:
 [disinterested] Eh, I guess so.

Doug:
 Oh, hey, Stewie. I had no idea, I'd run into the town square in the town square.

Doug:
 My opponent, Noah, got foot and mouth disease so I'm running unopposed. I'd really have to put my foot in my mouth to lose.

Fouad:
 [offscreen] Oh-ho! It's funny because wordplay!

Doug:
 Hey, Stewie. A little birdie told me you've thrown your hat into the snack captain ring.

Bird:
 Actually, it was a tweet. [snickers]

Kid:
 I'm too young to deliver a joke!

Chris:
 Stewie, our polls show that your classmates see you as aloof. We need a photo op of you kissing a baby.

Stewie:
 Alright, well make it a BOC.

Chris:
 A what?

Stewie:
 A baby of color!

Stewie:
 I'll make a speech even greater than Jeffrey Epstein's eulogy!

Miss Tammy:
 Wow, what a little bitch!

Doug:
 Tell me what you know.

Meg:
 Stewie's a mistake.

Doug:
 How do you know this?

Chris:
 Because I'm his brother.

Stewie:
 In an effort to win the election, Doug has stooped to the most preposterous of lies and mudslinging! He claims I was a whoops baby! A mistake!

Brian:
 Well, if you think about it, it ... it is possible.

Stewie:
 No, it's not! That's absurd!

Brian:
 To be honest, I've wondered the same thing. You are much younger than Chris and Meg. Lois and Peter had two children, back to back, a boy and a girl, one of each, and then stopped. And those two were already a stretch for Peter's meager salary. I mean, don't you think it's a little odd that their plan would include waiting 14 years until Lois was in her 40s, not exactly prime reproductive years, to have their third child? I'm ... I'm not saying it's true but if you do the math it ... kind of makes sense.

Stewie:
 [shocked] ... My God. Everything about this is terrible!

Brian:
 Why do you think Peter keeps leaving you on the fire station steps?

Shawn Mendes:
 Wherever a suburban mom is having trouble with a phone thing, I'll be there.

Joe:
 Hey, Quagmire. Betty or Veronica?

Quagmire:
 Both!

Who Else But Quagmire Guy:
 [to the tune of "Sugar Sugar"] Oh, Quagmire! ... Who else but Quagmire?

Stewie:
 What? You've got a secret weapons room?

Chris:
 Not exactly. It's a porn room.

Stewie:
 These are impressively organized and cataloged.

Chris:
 People in the community like things well-labeled, so I developed The Spewey Decimal System.

Stewie:
 I don't wanna sound like a square but if you put this level of effort into your schoolwork, you could really soar!

Chris:
 See that? That's a mint-condition 1983 Kurt Russel-Goldie Hawn sex tape. Never been opened. Market value of 150K.

Stewie:
 But if it's never been opened, how do you know it's the real thing?

Chris:
 Oh, it's a real thing. People in the community trust each other.

Stewie:
 Stop saying "People in the community". I prefer not to picture that community.

Stewie:
 Brian, say "hello" to the new snack captain!

Brian:
 You actually won? Wow! Congrats, Stewie! I thought you being a mistake ruined your chances. How'd you pull it off?

Stewie:
 It turns out 70% of the kids' parents aren't married and 30% are mistakes. Nobody gets married anymore! One kid doesn't even have parents. He just kind of appeared. Sleeps in one of the cubbys. I mean, that's the story I would've told this week but whatever. Oh, and Doug died in a commuter plane crash this morning.

Allen:
 And I think margs are gonna be on you after this adventure, huh?

Old West:
 I don't drink that shit.

Allen:
 Okay, we'll figure something out.

Meg:
 Crap! Gene, they're coming! They're coming fast, Gene! Starting recording, Gene! GENE!!

Peter:
 Sorry I put you in a dress, Stewie. We needed a damsel.

Stewie:
 Hey, do I look upset?

Lois:
 Are you brushing with a grill brush?

Peter:
 I left my toothbrush at a hotel 3 years ago.

Lois:
 Look, now don't worry it's just a week. And taking care of kids is not that hard

Peter:
 The Facebook status of every girl I went to high school with would disagree.

Agent:
 Why don't you guys come over tonight? We'll hang out on the patio.

Malley:
 Yeah, ... okay. That sounds nice. Want me to bring anything?

Agent:
 How 'bout the food and the drinks?

Malley:
 ... That feels like everything but okay.

Peter:
 [drives up to Adam West High School and hands Chris and Meg their lunch sacks] Get out.

Meg:
 [looks in her lunch sack] There's a grenade in here.

Peter:
 Use it to get a better lunch.

Coffee Girl:
 Hey, we normally order at the counter but it looks like you've got your hands full today. What can I get you?

Peter:
 Can you stuff a blueberry in a cup and pour coffee all over it?

Coffee Girl:
 Where's this little guy's mom. Is she coming in too?

Peter:
 No, she's not with us.

Coffee Girl:
 Oh, my. She's dead? I'm so sorry.

Peter:
 Oh, ... actually ...

Coffee Girl:
 Is there anything else I can bring you? We make a great homemade banana cream pie. It's on the house.

Peter:
 Uh, ... yeah. My wife is dead. I'll have that pie.

Joe:
 How is Lois' foot? I'm not rooting for her to lose it but ...

Stewie:
 This is the closest I've been to Mr. Quagmire. He's wearing makeup.

Cleveland:
 You're a dad, alone. That's the closest thing people get to seeing a hero. It's right after wounded veteran or ugly person who sings well.

Lois:
 Every door you walk through isn't a scenario you typed into the search bar of Pornhub. This is real life!

Mom:
 No biting, Aiden!

Peter:
 So, how long have you had a pet cloud?

Becky:
 That's ... a skylight.

Peter:
 Does it bite?

Becky:
 I'm glad we did this. Having to entertain a kid all day is exhausting. How long have you been doing it alone?

Peter:
 Uh, feels like forever.

Becky:
 Yeah, I know. Doesn't get any easier. I thought that after my late husband, Scott, I ...

Peter:
 [yawns loudly] Huh?

Peter:
 Oh no! Your pet cloud got out!

Becky:
 That's a ... a window.

Peter:
 So, ... So, it'll come back?

Chris:
 Need help, mom?

Lois:
 Can you get rid of this fly? There's a swatter in the top drawer of the dresser.

Chris:
 Okay, that drawer is full of sex toys.

Lois:
 Oh. Well we must have moved the flyswatter, uh, try the middle drawer.

Chris:
 Is this a bit? Because that drawer is also filled to the brim with sex toys.

Lois:
 Sorry. Look in the bottom drawer.

Chris:
 [crying] Wrong again!

Brian:
 What's going on? Who's this?

Becky:
 You didn't tell me you had a dog!

Peter:
 He's very close to being put down. I didn't want you to get attached.

Lois:
 I heard the doorbell. Who was it?

Peter:
 Delivery guy. We ordered dinner.

Lois:
 Oh, where did you order from?

Peter:
 That place you hate.

Delivery Man:
 [loudly] HI, I HAVE YOUR BONER AND BUTT PILLS FROM GLADIATOR.

Peter:
 Murder the carpet!

Peter:
 [happily] HELLO!

Peter:
 Hey! Hey, hey, what are you doing, Bonnie?

Bonnie:
 I told Lois I would bring her a loaf of my sourdough bread!

Peter:
 She doesn't want it.

Bonnie:
 What!? I just talked to her.

Peter:
 She's dead. Lois died. Go away!

Bonnie:
 Oh my God! ... What are you doing with her washing machine?

Peter:
 It's not for sale! You'd need a furniture dolly to get it out the basement, anyway.

Bonnie:
 We have one. I'll give you $100.

Peter:
 Yeah, uh, ... uh, ... alright, okay. Maybe, maybe. Will it fit through the bulkhead door?

Meg:
 Ugh, probably a prowler. It's cool. I know him. He'll just go right into my bed.

Peter:
 It's alright, Peter. Just open the calm app.

Peter:
 Your credit card has been declined.

Peter:
 [pretending to be happy] WHEEEEEE!

Lois:
 I'm sorry, who the Hell are you and why are you holding my baby?

Stewie:
 See? Total bitch, right?

Peter:
 If I've learned anything this week, it's that all mothers are heroes and the biggest hero I know is the one I'm lucky enough to call my wife.

Lois:
 Oh, Peter. That almost cancels out everything you've done.

Lois:
 Look, Becky. I don't blame you for what happened.

Chris:
 Nobody does.

Lois:
 But you're a beautiful woman. You can do better than a 44-year-old morbidly obese guy.

Becky:
 You know what? You're right. Ever since I lost my late husband, Scott, I ...

Griffins:
 [yawns loudly] Huh?

Ugly Girl:
 May I join the losers club?

Chris:
 [sigh] I don't care what yearbook captions you saw. We are not yet an organized club.

Pizza Bread:
 The deed to the house is in the drawer, under the phone!

Principal Shepherd:
 I've just taken the job as head coach in attempt to build character for my upcoming divorce hearing.

Meg:
 I thought you were already divorced.

Principal Shepherd:
 I was. I'm getting divorced again. Turns out the first bitch might have been right about my misogyny.

Brian:
 Hey, Stewie. What are you watching?

Stewie:
 The most glorious website of all time. You...Tube. I only hope that the site doesn't run out of content for me to watch.

Brian:
 You know, you should really be careful on YouTube, Stewie. You never know what's gunna pop up next. There's some wild stuff out there.

Stewie:
 Okay, boomer.

Peter:
 Hey, Quagmire. What are you doing here? One of these gals turning 18?

Peter:
 Meg is trying out and Lois made me come cuz she says I'm her...dad.

Peter:
 Hey, Meg! I can see your penis! Haha, she looked.

Principal Shepherd:
 She did look.

Principal Shepherd:
 Where's the energy, ladies? And that was meant as an insult.

Meg:
 They just let any strange adult in here any time, huh?

Quagmire:
 Yeah, well the gym is not connected to the main campus, so uh, ...

Quagmire:
 Well, there's your spinach, Popeye. [laughs] Oh, man. Am I aging myself.

Quagmire:
 Alright, I'm gunna go to the gym snack bar and buy a Dixie cup of Diet Pepsi for six bucks.

Meg:
 It all goes to the student council.

Quagmire:
 [laughing in rage] Well, it...it sure goes to somebody!

Lois:
 Are you recording this?

Peter:
 I can't. I dropped my phone down a bleacher slat. I hope I don't ruin some teenage sexual encounter.

Teenager:
 [offscreen] Ow! The finger I was about to use!

Peter:
 Hey, Meg! Every game you play is a game of horse, with that face!

Principal Shepherd:
 Ha.

Quagmire:
 Wow, boom goes the Babadook! See you on SportsCenter Top 10! [to the tune of the SportsCenter intro] Giggity! Giggity!

Peter:
 Hey, Meg! This is the closest you're gunna get to hardwood!

Peter:
 Meg's pronouns are yick and uck!

Peter:
 First one to the bedroom gets to be on the bottom!

Stewie:
 [to Rupert] Oh, suddenly the guy who smokes two packs a day wants to live forever.

Peter:
 Oh, suddenly "The Fighty Whiteys" is offensive?

Lois:
 Take off the sweatshirt.

Wilkerson:
 Stewie's not here right now. I'm Mrs. Padbury Wilkerson.

Boone:
 And I'm Boone. I'd be happy to talk about seeing Pappy all up in Mama's guts. You know, sometimes, you just gotta smash.

Wilkerson:
 It's not polite to talk like that in front of Stewie. He's just a wee child.

Kermit the Frog:
 Kermit the Frog here to smooth over some confusing images with rainbows.

Rick:
 I'm just your average guy, who likes to beat up dogs because it makes me feel in control when my wife and three daughters emasculate me.

Brian:
 Stop, wait! I want Mrs. Padberry-Wilkerson back!

Wilkerson:
 Sorry, Mrs. Padberry-Wilkerson is in the loo.

Brian:
 Bring back that southern guy!

Boone:
 Sorry, I'm busy watching Mrs. Padberry-Wilkerson use the john!

Brian:
 Can I talk to someone else? Literally anyone!

Gilbert Gottfried:
 I'm Gilbert Gottfried and I was fired from Aflac for no reason!

Brian:
 Well, there ... there was some reason.

Meg:
 The other team was disqualified from the league. I guess one of them was Gilbert Gottfried?

Gilbert Gottfried:
 I have to do something!

Brian:
 Enough! Stewie. You're losing it because you haven't napped in days. You're cranky. You're scared.

Meg:
 Come on, Meg. You can do this. Everyone who's not looking at their phone is counting on you.

Peter:
 You listen to your father. From the bottom of my heart, I wish we'd never had you.

Quagmire:
 Excuse me, I think my steak is overcooked?

Waitress:
 This is Applebee's. It's definitely overcooked.

Peter:
 [as he enters Bob's Burgers] Oop, I backed up all the way into the show before us. [whispering to Bob Belcher] Wife talking about her dream.

Bob Belcher:
 [to Homer Simpson sitting next to Peter while eating a burger] Homer, you've got company.

Peter:
 [sits down and looks at the menu] Why are there two sets of prices?

Bob Belcher:
 One's the Emmy winner discount.

Peter:
 Ah...Black coffee and toast, please.

Carter:
 [off-screen] Listen up, everyone in the van. We're taking Tatum to the zoo.

Lois:
 [angry] The zoo?

Peter:
 [enters] The zoo? Wha...What? Are we returning Chris? [goes into Meg's room] Hey Meg, did you hear we're going to the zoo? Wha..What? Are we returning Chris? [goes into Chris' room] Hey Chris, we're going to the zoo. What? Are we returning Chri...

Chris:
 [slaps Peter] Keep my name out your fucking mouth!

Peter:
 [using a bad tone] Wow, dude, it was a zoo joke.

Chris:
 KEEP MY NAME OUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH!!

Preston:
: Peter, what are you doing up there?

Peter:
 Preston. I'm glad you're here. I'm about to test the prototype for "desk-poline".

Peter:
 Desk will need to be bouncy.

Stewie:
 Damn you, vile woman! Youve impeded my work since the day I escaped from your wretched womb.

Stewie:
 Hello, Mother.

Lois:
 Well, hi, there, sweetie!

Stewie:
 You know, Mother, life is like a box of chocolates  You never know what youre going to get. Your life, however, is more like a box of active grenades!

Stewie:
 Now, I offer you one last chance for deliverance

Lois:
 Oh, you just want your toy back. OK, here you go, honey. Lois places the mindcontrol device on top of the box of grenades

Stewie:
 Yes, well, victory is mine! Stewie runs out of the kitchen carrying the grenades and the mindcontrol device; a moment later, the grenades detonate

Stewie:
 playing with his Sesame Street phone Put me through to the Pentagon!

Stewie:
 Dont toy with me, Ernie! Ive already dispatched with Mr. Hooper, Ive got six armed men stationed outside Big Birds nest, and as for Linda... well its rather difficult for a deaf woman to hear an assassin approach, now, isnt it?

Stewie:
 Hoho, indeed I can! pulls out a laser gun and shoots the phone with each number ONE! TWO! THREE! Can I count to three? For Gods sake, Im already shooting at a fifthgrade level.Lois tries to feed Stewie his broccoli "airplane style."

Stewie:
 Damn the broccoli, damn you, and damn the Wright Brothers!

Lois:
 My, arent we fussy tonight? OK. No broccoli.

Stewie:
 Very well then. ILois shoves the broccoli into his mouth. Stewie spits it out. Who the hell do you think you are?

Lois:
 Honey, its not gonna go away just because you dont like it.

Stewie:
 Well then, my goal becomes clear

Stewie:
 in his diary Day 171. Ive sprouted another finger. Counting the one from yesterday, looks at his penis, Im up to 11.

Peter:
 after losing his Cheesy Charlies reservation Chris, this is a big day for you. Today you become the man of the house, because when we get home, your mother is going to kill me.

Stewie:
 Damn you, woman, awake from your damnable reverie!

Lois:
 sighs Honey, Im doing the dishes.

Stewie:
 sarcastically Oh, well, a thousand pardons for disrupting your flatware sanitation ritual, but, you see, Im in searing pain! points to his mouth

Lois:
 Oh, youre just teething, Stewie, its a normal part of a babys life.

Stewie:
 Very well then. I order you to kill me at once!

Lois:
 Oh honey, I know youre hurting, but Mommy has to clean up the house, all right?

Stewie:
 No, its not all right! For the love of God, shake me, shake me like a British Nanny!

Peter:
 I cant even watch TV anymore. All the shows are starting to run together.

Brian:
 Gosh, Id like to help you, Peter, but uh, Ive gotta go out in the hall and chew on the back of my ass for about five minutes.

Meg:
 So, do you like music?

Meg:
 Uh, you first.

Peter:
 Look, Chris. Its a whole family of wasps.

Peter:
 Canada sucks! Peter has a flashback of when he was on Jeopardy!

Peter:
 rings in Diarrhea. the crowd laughs What? Oh. Oh. Oh. Sorry. Sorry. What is diarrhea? after seeing the news about the heat wave

Chris:
 about Diane I think I saw one of her nipples!

Lois:
 Chris, thats a terrible word! sarcastically "Nipple". Ill chalk that up to the heat, mister.

Peter:
 Brian, teach me how to be a gentleman.

Brian:
 Well, Peter, its not really that hard. Lets start with a polite conversation. For example, its a pleasure to see you again. Lovely weather were having. Now you try.

Peter:
 Its a pleasure to see you again. After Hogans Heroes, Bob Crane got his skull crushed in by a friend who videotaped him having rough sex. Hows that?

Brian:
 Wow. Perfect. My work is done. But just for the heck of it, lets try it again.

Maids and Butlers M&B:
 We only live to kiss your ass

Maids and Butlers M&B:
 From here on in its easy street

Maids and Butlers M&B:
 Well stop Jehovahs at the gate one man comes up to the gates

Peter:
 My God, this house is freakin sweet!

Peter:
 returns home Lois, put the coffee on!

Lois:
 Careful! I just cleaned the floor.

Peter:
 Good thing. Huh? laughs

Lois:
 Your Holiness, this is such an honor! Please, go into the living room, and make yourself at home!

Peter:
 Nooooo! runs over to Trix rabbit and smacks Trix out of hand Silly rabbit, Trix are for kids. Damn longears trying to take Easter away from Jesus! to Chicken Man Im sorry, what were you saying?

Lois:
 Well, its nice to have music while we eat.

Lois:
 whispers Lets get the hell out of here.

Brian:
 Oh, just die already.

Meg:
 EWW! Mom! Stewie peed on the rug again!

Brian:
 NO!

Stewie:
 Why dont you teach it to the Chinese girl? Or perhaps she can learn after her people invade your country.

Stewie:
 Oh, try and stop them. And try and stop Pablos people from using drug money to buy arms from Lis countrymen who will in turn sell them to Yuris people so they can ethnically cleanse the rest of this nauseatingly diverse grab bag of genetic party favors you call a family. So now you understand, yes? You all hate each other.

Peter:
 Oh, you people can kiss the fattest part of my ass!

Peter:
 points at Chris He is.

Lois:
 Peter, youve never done a creative thing in your life.

Peter:
 Thats not true. I wrote The Bonfire of the Vanities.

Lois:
 No, you didnt.

Lois:
 Youre not being creative. Youre just destroying a wonderful show.

Peter:
 Hey, hey. I have more creativity in my whole body than most people do before 9

Lois:
 The only thing you create before 9

Peter:
 I think my work will speak for itself. walks out of room and comes back a few seconds later laughs I just got that. A poop joke? Thats real creative, Lois.

Stewie:
 to Peter Youre the worst thing to happen to musical theater since Andrew Lloyd Webber.

Lois:
 Ugh, typical male fantasy... women drinkin beer. I guarantee you a man made that commercial.

Peter:
 Of course a man made it. Its a commercial, Lois. Not a delicious Thanksgiving dinner.

Peter:
 Theres gotta be an explanation for all this!

Brian:
 You want an explanation? smacks Peter GOD... IS...PISSED!

Peter:
 Ill handle it, Lois. I read a book about this sort of thing once.

Brian:
 Are you sure it was a book? Are you sure it wasnt nothing?

Peter:
 ...Oh yeah.

Lois:
 Well continue this discussion tonight, young man. A woman is not an object.

Peter:
 Your mothers right, son. Listen to what it says.

Peter:
 I didnt say that. Lee Majors did.

Lois:
 Peter, you can take off your blindfold now, were almost there.

Peter:
 Not yet, I dont wanna ruin my birthday surprise.

Lois:
 Then at least let me drive!

Peter:
 Lois, you know its illegal for women to drive. cat screeches A woman driving... he is now driving through oncoming traffic laughs thats adorable.

Peter:

Chris:

Stewie:
 What the hell is this? I said egg whites only! Are you trying to give me a bloody heart attack?!? hurls his plate against a wall Make it again!

Stewie:
 Ah, the breakfast thing. Yes. It wasnt even about the eggs, really. Frankly, I like the yolks. I do. I have no problem. Its just, theres always been a lot of tension between Lois and me. And its not so much that I want to kill her. Its just I want her not to be alive anymore. I sometimes wonder if all women are this difficult, and then I think to myself

Stewie:
 Arent you a little old to be wearing braces? man covers mouth, embarrassed

Stewie:
 Hello, operator? Hello? Oh God, thats right, you have to punch in the numbers nowadays. I should know this...oh, yes, 8675309, thats it. No wait, thats not it.

Lois:
 Now dont try and pawn this off on your sister, shes a good girl.

Chris:
 Oh yeah? What about the time she strangled my other sister?

Lois:
 nervously Chris, honey, we told you, that was just a bad dream.

Chris:
 But I remember it so clear

Brian:
 eating an apple Well, well, well. Looks like someones in love.

Stewie:
 HA! Thats so funny I forgot to laugh...excluding that first "HA."

Brian:
 Uhhuh. Face it, youre a sucker for a woman with blue eyes.

Stewie:
 AHA! Her eyes are GREEN!

Brian:
 AHA! Thank you for proving my point.

Stewie:

Stewie:

Peter:
 Lois has had the car all week, and its just been hell getting around. I actually had to rent a mustang.

Peter:
 What are you gonna make me do? Whack a guy? Off a guy? Whack off a guy? Cause Im married.

Stewie:

Meg:
 Wow, Chris, did you lose weight?

Chris:
 Um, maybe. IIve been working out.

Meg:
 Well, you look wicked skinny. Im, like, jealous!

Chris:

Meg:
 I dont have a mustache...do I?

Lois:
 Oh, honey, its fine. It makes you look distinguished.

Meg:
 But, Mom!

Lois:
 Now, Meg, I think all my children are beautiful.

Stewie:
 Damn you ice cream! Come to my mouth. How...dare you disobey me? a passing baby in a stroller waves at him What are you looking at you...you infantile...stupid? Thats right, damn you and such. You can yawns go burn in hell... falls asleep

Lois:
 Chris, is that a note?

Lois:
 Yes it is. Would you like to read it for the rest of the class?

Chris:

Meg:

Chris:
 reading the note I think Mrs. Griffin is hot.

Lois:

Chris:
 Dad, I tried to go to school, but this guy wont let me.

Chris:
 The U.S. Army. points to tanks and soldiers on the other side of the fence

Peter:
 Oh, thats a good army.

Lois:
 Oh, I havent been on a college campus in years. Everything seems so different.

Stewie:
 Really? Perhaps if you laid on your back with your ankles behind your ears, that would ring a few bells?

Meg:
 Mayor West, youve been talking for an hour and I dont have anything I can use in my article. Can you just please...

Meg:
 It just went down the drain.

Meg:
 You spent public money investigating this? Thanks. You know, I think I have my story. leaves

Lois:

Brian:
 Come to think of it, there was something very different about that Honeymooners episode I watched today.

Brian:
 You mean, the way you cant control that messed up way that you laugh when you think something is really, really funny?

 Shes so pretty that if your Hacky Sack were my private parts, Id let her do that to them.

Chris:
 Um, wait...yes.

Chris:
 Matthew McConaughey?

Stewie:
 Chris, grab his legs! I gotta bury this thing.

Chris:
 But I...

Stewie:
 GRAB HIS GODDAMN LEGS!!!

Peter:
 Ill tell you whats not safe

Peter:
 So, yall set to go hunting? Cheney shoots him about ten times. Peter screams each time until he falls on the ground

Peter:
 shows Carrot Top a saw wearing glasses I found this saw with glasses on it.

Peter:
 Oh, my God! Oh, my God! You are so fucking funny! You are so Goddamn you for being so

Lois:
 Peter, these are parachutes! What the hell are we going to do with parachutes?

Peter:
 They were to distract you while I put on the one scuba suit.

Peter:
 That wasnt oxygen, that was a tank of Tony Danzas breath! I wonder who got my oxygen tank.

Stewie:
 Did I miss my cue?

Peter:
 Although I probably pushed things too far when I did the incest episode.

Chris:
 nervously Oh, uh...hi, Mom.

Lois:
 in a shaky voice Hi, Chris... they both have a shameful look on their faces

Brian:
 in the kitchen with his head down, pounding his fist on the table everytime he says wrong WRONG! Its WRONG!

Peter:
 Yeah, I got something to say. stands on a stool You know, we kid around a lot here, but the truth is, we care about each other. And we to be back, because we wanna address some serious issues and, you know, do something we can all be proud of. Peter farts; everyone laughs

Peter:
 That was me. I used to think flatulence was something to laugh about. Truth is, 300,000,000 Americans a day expel gas through their anus more about flatulence, you can visit my ass. farts again, then laughs Just yankin ya. scene fades to black for a moment, then back in again; Peter farts once more

Peter:
 I want some ice cream.

Peter:
 I hate you! I hate you! I want my mommy!

Quagmire:
 Oh, we're just getting started!

Cleveland:
 Meg is my least favorite of all your children!

Peter:
 It's alright. We'll just move the party to the skating rink. Who's sober enough to drive? nobody answers Uh, okay, who's drunk, but that special kind of drunk where you're a better driver because you know you're drunk? You know, the kind of drunk where you probably shouldn't drive, but you do anyway because, I mean, come on, you got to get your car home. Right? I mean, I mean, what do they expect me to do, take a bus? Is that what they want? For me to take a bus? Well, screw that! You take a bus.

Cleveland:
 I'm that kind of drunk.

Peter:
 throws Cleveland the car keys Shotgun!

Lois:
 So, how was work today, Meg?

Lois:
 Oh. Peter, you lost your job because of the Super Store. You shouldn't blame Meg.

Lois:
 And you can stop making that fart sound every time someone says Meg.

Brian:
 So, how was your day exploiting the town's resources, Meg?

Chris:
 laughs Meg.

Chris:
 MEG!

Chris:
 Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg!

Chris:
 quietly Meg.

Meg:
 I'm not gonna sit here and take this! I'm the only one in this family who has a job!

Brian:
 Yeah, like she'd get paid for that.

Meg:
 What did he just say to you?

Brian:
 Nothing. There was It's like if you Forget it. It's nothing, Meg.

Stewie:
 You can't leave, man, that's desertion. They'll come after you like Peter went after that hockey coach. pause, but there's no cutaway Oh, no clip? Oh, thought we had a clip. Nope? Okay. Uhuh, you can't leave, Brian...

Brian:
 All right, it shouldn't be too hard to get us kicked out.

Stewie:
 Right. We've just got to convince them we're not army material. Ready?

Brian:
 All right, let's do it. they start making out

Stewie:
 Wow, look at how gay we are! I am so gay, with my gayness!

Brian:
 Me too! I'm... I'm a homo!

Stewie:
 Hell yeah! Brian slaps him

Peter:
 Quagmire, check it out! I took ten M80s and stuck 'em all together. I call it "Peter Griffin's BunkerBustin'MegaUltraSuper..." the firecrackers explode all at once in his hand, knocking him down to the ground; screams; holds up his fingerless hand to everyone HOLY CRAP!!!

Lois:
 OH, MY GOD!! YA BLEW OFF ALL YOUR FINGERS!

Stewie:
 You know, no huge hurry, but I'm sorta outta juice over here. taps his empty cup Bone dry.

Chris:
 There's one of Dad's fingers!

Meg:
 We have to hurry! I learned in biology, if you get 'em back soon enough, they can be reattached.

Cleveland:
 What's all the commotion?

Stewie:
 Now, why in the world would you be embarrassed about dating her?

Stewie:
 to Brian Are her parents brother and sister?

Brian:
 Can you please leave now?!

Stewie:
 Oh. Now I get it. She's a moron! But a moron with large breasts, you can use as mountains for your Matchbox cars or whatever it is grownups do with large breasts.

Brian:
 Shut up! That's not it at all.

Peter:
 reading Meg's sex pamphlet "If you have sex, your penis will fall off and land in another dimension populated entirely by dogs who will eat it". Well, that's something I'd like to avoid. Well, this changes everything! From now on, I too will be "obstinent".

Meg:
 Abstinent.

Peter:
 Absent.

Peter:
 You're grounded.*

Peter:
 Oh, that was fantastic. Hey, where'd you get that tattoo on your lower back?

Lois:
 I don't know, Peter. Meth is a hell of a drug.

Peter:
 Oh, Smilla, your sense of snow is equalled only by your sense of love!

Lois:
 Peter, have you been up all night watching chick movies?

Peter:
 Lois, before I found these movies, women only made me cry through my penis. Now they make me cry through my eyes.

Brian:
 So what happened?

Stewie:
 Well, you wanna know what I learned this week? Being a grownup sucks. Women, Brian what a royal pain in the ass. It's like, it's like, why can't you just hang out with guys, you know? Just live with someone of your own sex, just do what you would do with women, but with your buddy, you know wha why don't guys just do that?

Brian:
 They do, it's called being gay.

Stewie:
 Oh, that's what gay is? Oh yeah, I could totally get into that.

Brian:
 drunk You know, Connie, I think I have a theory about why you're such a bitch.

Meg:
 Brian, let's just go.

Brian:
 No, no, no, no, no. Hang on. Hang on, Meg. Hang on. You see, Connie, you're popular because you developed early and started putting out when you were 12. But now you can't stand to look at yourself in the mirror, because all you see is a whore. So you pick on Meg to avoid the inevitable realization that once your body's used up by age 19, you're gonna be a wornout, chalkyskinned burlap sack that even your stepdad won't want. How's that? Am I in the ballpark?

Meg:
 Morning, cutie!

Brian:
 Hey.

Meg:
 I had so much fun last night, Brian. Hey, I thought maybe we could go get some coffee later.

Brian:
 I I don't think so.

Meg:
 Oh, come on! Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Huh? Who's a good boy?

Brian:
 Me.

Meg:
 speaks baby talk Oh, yes, yes, yes! Who's a good boy?!

Brian:
 I am. I'm a good boy. But, no, no, no. Look. Look. I got stuff to do today. All right? Sorry.

Meg:
 Well, we should hook up, anyway. I'll bug ya later. leaves

Peter:
 How much for the gloves?

Brian:
 Peter, those are yours.

Peter:
 10 bucks! $2! $7! $4! $5.50! $10! Sold! slyly Sucker. I would have gone to fifteen easy. I am so stupid.

Brian:
 While running away with Stewie How are we gonna get out of here?

Stewie:
 You still got the starting gun?

Stewie:
 Give it to me.

Stewie:
 To the driver of the car, while holding up the gun Get out of the fucking car! Get out of the fucking car right now man! breaks car window with the gun Get out of the fucking car! Do it, do it, do it! I'll fucking kill you! Get the fuck out of the fucking car!

Brian:
 Did we just carjack someone?

Stewie:
 We sure did Brian, we sure did.

Lois:
 So, Meg, your birthday's coming up, huh? You excited about turning...

Peter:
 Uh, Meg, I got 16 candles for your birthday cake. How does that sound?

Meg:
 That's not right.

Peter:
 So, less, more, too many, not enough?

Meg:
 You stupid son of a bitch! You don't even know how old I am!

Lois:
 Meg, that kind of language is not appropriate for a girl your age, or is it?

Meg:
 I'm gonna be 17, you jerks! leaves

Peter:
 to Kyle You got LEGOs? Aw, sweet! Lois only buys me Mega Bloks.

Lois:
 They're the same thing, Peter.

Peter:
 You know what, Lois? They're not the same thing. And the sooner you get that through your thick skull, the sooner we can get this marriage back on track.

Stewie:
 whispers I love you.

Brian:
 What? What'd you say?

Stewie:
 Uh, olive juice.

Brian:
 Olive juice?

Stewie:
 whispers Olive juice, you too.

Peter:
 Hey, Meg, come here. Have a seat. she sits down next to him. Peter then does a fake yawn, stretches his arms out, and puts one around Meg

Peter:
 Meg, I'm a redneck. Which means I am about to do something to you that you will not remember until you're 40.

Peter:
 Meg, come back here! I meant sex!

Peter:
 Hey, Bill, you up for a little bowling? I swiped some money out of Lois' purse. I don't think she'll notice, 'cause she's here, humping you?!

Lois:
 gasps Peter! starts putting on and buttoning her shirt Look, I know this looks bad, and I feel horrible, andand I know nothing I could say to you could possibly justify why I slept with Bill, except... voice gets increasingly more lustful I mean, Peter, the man presided over the longest economic expansion in U.S. History and... inhales he reduced the percentage of Americans on welfare to its lowest level in 33 years!

Lois:
 35 years, Peter!

Brian:
 How do you think it works?

Stewie:
 I have no idea.

Brian:
 Look, Lois told me I had to start using the toilet and you're the one who's had potty training, so I'm counting on you to help me.

Stewie:
 All right, we're two intelligent guys. We can figure this out.

Brian:
 What's that big back part?

Stewie:
 Maybe that's where the wizard lives who operates this thing. It would be wise not to anger him.

Brian:
 I wonder what this thing is for.

Stewie:
 Brian, be careful with that. We don't know what it does.

Brian:
 sighs All right, here goes.

Stewie:
 Oh, God. Oh, God. Careful. Careful. Careful. Careful.

Brian:
 OW! Damn it, Peter! Stop it! I gotta tell you, you're pissin' me off worse than when I watched the O.J. verdict with my old roommate.

Brian:
 Maybe we should get new roommates.

Lois:
 Oh, it is so good to be home. You know, I wanted us to live in a place with real family values, but values don't come from where you live or who your friends are. They come from inside, from your own beliefs.

Peter:
 I agree, Lois. Like, for instance, if you're watching a TV show and you decide to take your values from that... you're an idiot. Maybe you should take responsibility for what values your kids are getting. Maybe you shouldn't be letting your kids watch certain shows in the first place if you have such a big problem with them, instead of blaming the shows themselves. long pause Yeah.

Peter:
 Horsey! You saved my life!

Peter:
 Wow! Gilbert Gottfried!

Lois:
 Peter, a little culture is good for this family. Besides, you liked The Nutcracker, didn't you?

Peter:
 No, Lois, I did not. The Nutcracker had zero physical comedy. Andand with a name like The Nutcracker, I thought, "Oh, this will be worth a few yuks." But no, Lois. That title wrote a check that the queers on stage refused to cash.

Lois:
 They cut a school's funding if it's got low test scores? This is not what the Founding Fathers had in mind.

Chris:
 Hi. I'm going doortodoor to campaign on behalf of Lois Griffin, who's offering real change for the city of Quahog. May we count on your vote next Tuesday? the camera pans to the person at the door, who turns out to be Lois

Lois:
 Chris, this is our house.

Chris:
 Ah. Then what is for dinner?

Lois:
 Pork chops.

Chris:
 Excellent.

Lois:
 Chris, have you been to any other houses?

Chris:
 I have not.

Lois:
 Would you like to come in?

Chris:
 Please.

Lois:
 Hey, you guys.

Chris:
 Mom, everyone on TV says you're running the town great. Maybe you could do some damn laundry once in a while.

Quagmire:
 to Lois Come here, baby, let's go play "Hide and Go Anal"!

Lois:
 Meg, stop staring at Mr. Griffin! I'm sorry, Peter. I'm afraid she's got her father's libido.

Quagmire:
 What can I say? I'm a Vagittarius! Oh!

Lois:
 I know! Who would have thought bin Laden was hiding out in the cast of MADtv?

Quagmire:
 Man, the perfect hiding spot  the one place no one would look.

Quagmire:
 Ok, who would you rather do, Jabba the Hutt right after a shower, or a service droid?

Quagmire:
 angrily My father was a service droid! starts to leave

Quagmire:
 Hey, where are you going?

Quagmire:
 Oh, you can just kiss the lower back end of the canister that is my body.

Stewie:
 That is fantastic! Terrific work! So, no weaknesses at all?

Chris:
 Is it a fast ship?

Brian:
 makes Chewbacca's trademark gargling roar for a second, then spits out water in a nearby sink Always gargle before a take-off. Wocka-wocka! All right, let's go.

Meg:
 Wow, Dad, thanks for keeping us entertained! That was a great story!

Chris:
 Yeah, but didn't Robot Chicken already do this three months ago?

Peter:
 Well, I wouldn't worry about it, Chris. I don't think people are even aware of that show's existence.

Chris:
 I don't know, Dad. I think a decent number of people watch it.

Peter:
 Oh, really? Define decent.

Chris:
 I think it's the highest rated show on Cartoon Network, and the Star Wars episode doubled that audience.

Peter:
 Well, yeah, but double ten people is like, twenty people, so what kind of numbers are we talking about here? Who knows?

Chris:
 Don't be glib about this stuff, Dad. It's a legitimate show, and they beat you to the punch.

Peter:
 Uh, I don't know about that, Chris. I mean, to me a legitimate show is on ABC, CBS, NBC, you know, one of the REAL networks.

Chris:
 chuckles I don't know about that, Dad.

Peter:
 And besides, what's up with that 15-minute run time? What is that? It's like 15 minutes of guys playing with "Star Wars" dolls. Oh, yay, yaaay! Tune me in for that.

Chris:
 Oh, so you do know the show?

Peter:
 I read part of a review online. I'm not a fan.

Chris:
 angrily You know, Dad, you're a real jerk!

Lois:
 So, Meg, any luck finding another job?

Meg:
 No. Hardly anybody's hiring right now. The only job I could find was for a phone sex line, and I sucked at it.

Meg:
 What am I wearing? Um...a hat, and...glasses? What kind of underwear? Um...I don't know...big underwear, I guess. I'm sorry, what? Oh. What would I do to you? Well, um... I guess, maybe we could get pizza, and...we could watch House?

Peter:
 All right, I am totally flaccid, but thank you anyway, ma'am. I appreciate your time. hangs up

Quagmire:
 Peter, this doesn't seem safe.

Cleveland:
 Yeah, I'm afraid I might- Cleveland falls off the mountain, then Spider-Man arrives, and shoots a web under Cleveland, breaking his fall Wow. Thanks, Spider-Man!

Peter:
 Uh, apparently, everybody gets one.

Lois:
 What are you-- Wha-what are you doing with a gun?

Stewie:
 Something I should have done a very long time ago. shoots rapidly at Lois until she falls into the water with blood on her chest I DID IT! I KILLED HER! SHE'S DEAD! laughs maniacally until he trips and cries Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! ...Oh, yeah, that's right.

Lois:
 All right, Peter. I'm going to kill Stewie. Dinner's in the oven. All you have to do is turn it to 350 at about 5

Peter:
 Yeah, okay, Lois.

Lois:
 Are you listening?

Lois:
 What did I just say?

Peter:
 Turn the oven to 350 at 5

Peter:
 Because he was an illegal immigrant and a threat to our national security!

Brian:
 He was an 85 year old Korean Buddhist!

Peter:
 Or was he supreme leader of al-Queda? I guess we'll find out if he ever gets a trial.

Peter:
 They're part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take 'em away!

Peter:
 Well, I guess everything's back to normal.

Peter:
 Oh, man. Not this guy again!

Meg:
 What's wrong?

Meg:
 What? Where?

Meg:
 Oh, my God! Dad!

Meg:
 What do you think you're doing?!

Peter:
 Chinese accent Peter? Who Peter?

Meg:
 I didn't say Peter. I said Dad!

Peter:
 normally Oh.

Meg:
 Have you been spying on us the entire time we've been dating?!

Peter:
 Meg, it's only because I wanna make sure this guy treats you right and doesn't try anything funny!

Meg:
 But, Michael.

Peter:
 See? Look, Meg. He just walked out on ya. He's a bad man, like Jodie Foster.

Brian:
 Didn't we have an electrician in there today?

Stewie:
 Uh, he left. Pretty sure he left.

Brian:
 Isn't that his truck?

Stewie:
 Well, by God, Brian, we're murderers. I guess this means you'll be going to Doggie Hell.

Stewie:
 Excellent. I'm a bigger hit with the kids than Will Smith and his nice, clean rap.

Peter:
 Stop mocking me!

Peter:
 Oh, I believe I am. Driver's license, Social Security card, American Express.

Peter:
 Well, Dave, I have a hilarious new movie comin' out on HBO next month. It's all about 9/11. The movie's called September 11th, 2000-Fun.

Peter:
 Well, you haven't heard what the movie's about. I play a window washer who has just finished washing the last window of the World Trade Center. And then I turn around to get off the scaffold, and what do you think I see coming? A plane! And I go, "Come on"! You know, it's real, real old-style comedy, you know, it's like two pies in the face, and one in a field in Pennsylvania.

Peter:
 And the voice of the plane is David Spade.

Chris:
 Are you a pedophile?

Stewie:
 Listen, I'll be your assistant, and we'll put on a whole big show!

Stewie:
 Yeah, we'll do all the great tricks. You can even split me in half.

Stewie:
 Saw me in half.

Lois:
 I don't know, Brian. Raising a child is a very rewarding experience.

Peter:
 You know what else is rewarding, Lois? Shutting your vag.

Peter:
 Hey, guys, what's going on?

Quagmire:
 Cool!

Cleveland:
 That thing don't bite, do it?

Peter:
 Guys, say hello to Adrian Beakey.

Peter:
 Hey, isn't that funny? He heard me say that on the way over in the car.

Peter:
 uncomfortable Uh, yeah, I had the radio on in the car and they were talking about some crazy stuff... So what are you-what are you guys drinkin'?

Lois:
 Chris, honey, what's wrong?

Chris:
 Anna took a dump on me.

Lois:
 What?!

Chris:
 Yeah, she broke up with me.

Lois:
 Oh-ho, she dumped you. That's what you meant to say.

Chris:
 What's the difference?

Lois:
 Well, when two people love each other very much, sometimes they show it by- y- never mind.

Peter:
 Brian, can I see that paper for a sec? Brian hands him the paper Huh, that's odd. I thought that would be big news.

Brian:
 You thought what would be big news?

Peter:
 Well, there seems to be an absence of a certain ornithological piece. A headline regarding mass awareness of a certain avian variety.

Brian:
 What are you talking about?

Peter:
 Oh, have you not heard? It was my understanding that everyone had heard.

Brian:
 Heard what?

Stewie:
 Brian, don't!

Peter:
 You seem like a nice guy. Why don'tcha come over to my house for dinner tonight?

Peter:
 Great! We'll have a blast. After we eat, we can watch that YouTube footage of Marlee Matlin callin' Moviefone.

Stewie:
 All right, Brian, we'll go. But don't touch anything while we're there. Even stepping on a mosquito can cause a chain reaction that drastically alters the present.

Stewie:
 Nah. You can do whatever you want.

Brian:
 Unless what?

Stewie:
 Whenever-

Chris:
 Yeah! But you remember the giant eagle they rode in the first one that then rescues them at the end of the 3rd one?

Chris:
 Yeah, why didn't they just fly the eagle to Mordor instead of spending 3 movies walking there?

Chris:
 I'm not arguing that with you. I'm just saying there's a hole in the story.

Chris:
 Well, that's not the point.

Chris:
 Of course. I love the movie. But look. I'm no writer. But if a fat kid like me with one finger up his nose is bumped by it, you'd think someone would've caught it.

Chris:
 No, I did. The eagle was majestic and beautiful, but sometimes you have to sacrifice spectacle for a coherent storyline.

Stewie:
 Well, Rupert, we're out of food, diapers, and just about everything else. Which means I've got to get a job. Otherwise, we'll be in worse shape than Morbidly-Obese Albert.

Stewie:
 Hey, New Brian. Oh, I see you're having pie. You know, pie isn't really pie without Cool Hwhip.

Stewie:
 Everything's better with Cool Hwhip.

Stewie:
 Did you hear what I said?

Brian:
 Yeah, what about it?

Stewie:
 It doesn't bother you the way I pronounce it? "Cool Hwhip?"

Brian:
 No, why would it?

Stewie:
 Cool Hwhip. I'm putting emphasis on the H.

Brian:
 Sounds right to me.

Stewie:
 Nothing ever bothers you, does it?

Brian:
 No, not really. I like everything.

Stewie:
 God, he's a bigger buzz kill than Buzz Killington.

Peter:
 Can you use it in a sentence please?

Peter:
 Huh. Can you use it in a dirty sentence?

Peter:
 T-R-E-E. Tree.

Brian:
 What's it called?

Brian:
 sarcastically Wow, a song named after a girl. There aren't a million of those already.

Stewie:
 Name 20.

Stewie:
 Name 6 more.

Brian:
 "Sherry", "Laura", "Wendy", "Maria", "Peggy Sue", "Minnie the Moocher".

Stewie:
 Name 5 more.

Brian:
 "Tracy", "Jean", "Jane", "Mary Ann", "Eleanor Rigby".

Stewie:
 Go fuck yourself.

Brian:
 Oh, there's my laptop. Do you mind? I want to check my e-mail.

Stewie:
 Go away! I'm editing this music video I'm making for Susie.

Brian:
 voice rising in pitch Oh, really. Music video? Working on a little video there? Little, uh... little music video? Little compilation of visual images to go with the song? Little four minute movie that tells the story of a...

Stewie:
 Yeah, that only works when I do it.

Lois:
 Peter, where have you been? You left for the market six hours ago! Did you get the beans?

Peter:
 Lois, I've got something better! You know how you've always wanted a real diamond engagement ring?

Lois:
 gasps, touched Oh my God!

Peter:
 That's right, I've bought a horse!

Peter:
 Okay, what's next?

Peter:
 in Rogen's voice Hey, doc, are we gonna be much longer? I gotta get some beers with the fellas before I go out on this date.

Peter:
 That's my name, don't put a knife in it.

Brian:
 Wow. Fred Savage is the greatest actor in the history of the world!

Lois:
 Well, if you let us run this story, I promise you they will.

Stewie:
 Yeah? Can you read my mind? Can you tell what I'm thinking right now? I'm thinkin' "shut up and get a salad".

Stewie:
 We'll get to you, Brent!

Stewie:
 Uh, hello!

Stewie:
 Oh, hailing frequencies open, huh? chuckles Uh, yeah. We're gonna get 2 McChicken Sandwiches and a Diet Coke and... What do you want, Michael?

Stewie:
 No. I already told you, they don't make those anymore.

Stewie:
 No McDonald's anywhere makes a McDLT anymore!

Stewie:
 It's September, Jonathan!

Stewie:
 No, LeVar. You're blind. That's the only way you can see.

Stewie:
 Just hang on! All right?! There's a lot of us! There's a lot-- It's a big order!

Stewie:
 It's 3

Stewie:
 None of 'em serve breakfast all day!

Peter:
 says grace before the meal Dear Lord, please give me the cheat codes from "Mike Tyson's Punch-Out". I have been stuck on Bald Bull for four years. I tried Left-Left-Up-B-dodge-uppercut, but it still knocks me out. And, you know, they say you're supposed to go Right-B-Up-dodge-Left-uppercu... laughs Listen to me, telling you how to play a game.

Peter:
 laughs He said it!

Peter:
 Hey, whatever happened to your son, Kevin?

Peter:
 unemotionally Sad.

Peter:
 Oh no! Connie's been hurt! I guess someone should lie on top of her to keep her warm.

Peter:
 What are you looking at? It's a cartoon!

Peter:
 You know somethin', Brian? I bet you'll make the late night monologues.

Brian:
 Lauren just finished a fascinating doctoral thesis on sub-orbital propulsion mechanisms that NASA is using for the next generation of space shuttles.

Peter:
 So, Lauren, um, whenever I'm watchin' your show...you give me wood. Where do we go from here?

Stewie:
 Well, it's done.

Brian:
 What the hell? What's happened to us?

Stewie:
 I don't know, but suddenly I feel all sweet and warm and fuzzy. It seems we're in a universe where everything is drawn by Disney.

Brian:
 Look! There's our house!

Stewie:
 laughing Look how gaily we run!

Brian:
 Whoa, this is trippy.

Stewie:
 I should say so. We're in the Robot Chicken universe.

Stewie:
 How's it feel to be on a major network for 30 seconds?

Stewie:
 Bye!

Brian:
 That's the problem with this world

Quagmire:
 See you later, bitches! Have fun with your stupid goddamn Giant Chicken jokes and your Conway Twitty... Hey, why is there a moving truck outside Cleveland's house?

Peter:
 I'm John Wayne at the first Thanksgiving, pilgrims. Happy Thanksgiving, pilgrims.

Peter:
 kicks the Drive Thru window Keep the change. zoom on Peter Road House.

Brian:
 about to set them on the dresser Here?

Brian:
 about to set them on the cushioned bench On this?

Brian:
 about to set them on the windowsill Here?

Brian:
 crossly You know what? Just take your fucking keys because I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. slams door

Lois:
 Oh, that's terrible.

Peter:
 Oh, my God! You've missed so much! Like when America was attacked by mentally challenged suicide bombers.

Peter:
 Now hang on, Quagmire, there's no guarantee that it's your baby.

Quagmire:
 Oooh, I say that...

Brian:
 Peter, I sharpened a pencil in my bum and now I need a band-aid.

Brian:
 I'm trying to establish a friendship with you. All I've done is try to be nice to you, and you still don't like me. How can you not like me?

Quagmire:
 Okay, I'll tell you. You are the worst person I know. You constantly hit on your best friend's wife. The man pays for your food and rescued you from certain death, and this is how you repay him? And to add insult to injury, you defecate all over his yard. And you're such a sponge. You pay for nothing. You always say mocks Brian "Ooh, I'll get you later", but later never comes. And what really bothers me, is you pretend that you're this deep guy that loves women for their souls, when all you do is date bimbos. Yeah, I date women for their bodies, but at least I'm honest about it. I don't buy them a copy of Catcher in the Rye and then lecture them with some seventh grade interpretation about how Holden Caulfield was some profound intellectual. He wasn't! He was a spoiled brat! And that's why you like him so much, He's you. God, you're pretentious. And you delude yourself by thinking you're some great writer, even though you're terrible. You know, I should've known Cheryl Tiegs didn't write me that note. She would've known there's no "a" in the word "definite". And what I think I hate most about you is your textbook liberal agenda. How we should mocks again "legalize pot, man", how big business is crushing the underclass, how homelessness is the biggest tragedy in America. Well what have you done to help? I work down at the soup kitchen, Brian. Never seen you down there. You wanna help? Grab a ladle! And by the way, driving a Prius doesn't make you Jesus Christ. Oh, wait. You don't believe in Jesus Christ, or any religion for that matter because mocks again "religion is for idiots". Well, who the hell are you to talk down to anyone?! You failed college twice, which isn't nearly as bad as your failure as a father. How's that son of yours you never see? But you know what? I could forgive all of that, all of it, if you weren't such a bore. That's the worst of it, Brian. You're just a big, sad, alcoholic bore. sighs, puts his napkin on the table, and sets to leave I'll see ya, Brian. Thanks for the fucking steak.

Brian:
 Lois was right. I'm not a writer. I'm a joke. I'm one big, fat, ridiculous joke. camera pulls out to show Bill from Family Circus sitting next to him

Brian:
 You know what, father from Family Circus? All you do is judge other people. Every day in the funnies, all you do is judge. Why don't you shut your goddamn mouth for once and go home and punch your wife in the face?

Peter:
 This is a very shocking Family Circus.

Stewie:
 Poor bastard’s more upset than when I read Curious George Goes to his Gym Coach’s Apartment.

Stewie:
 Monkeys aren’t supposed to drink chardonnay! He’s tricking you! Get out of there!

Peter:
 Here are some of the new products we'll be unveiling. flips page The African-American heart monitor.

Peter:
 Morning, nice people who I still don't know your names and who mean nothing to me.

Lois:
 Well, I certainly hope that doesn't apply to me, especially after last night.

Peter:
 You got a point there, hot stuff. smacks her rear end And if sex with the rest you is half as good as it was with her, then I think we're all gonna get along just fine.

Chris:
 Yay!

Lois:
 Well, no, no, Peter. You can't have sex with the kids.

Meg:
 Well, I wish you'd told him that before he lost his memory. everyone else gasps It was a joke! I was just making a joke!

Stewie:
 That's your sense of humor?!

Meg:
 I was just kidding! God!

Lois:
 Meg, that's awful!

Chris:
 Geez, open your mouth for a joke once and that's what you come up with?

Brian:
 That's messed up, Meg.

Meg:
 I was just trying to be funny.

Lois:
 That wasn't funny, that was just dark.

Stewie:
 Yeah, that's your father!

Chris:
 shoves Meg out of the kitchen Oh, get out, Meg! Get out of the kitchen! Go on, get out! Out, out, out! Get out of the kitchen! Go on, and get out of here!

Peter:
 Heh, heh, heh.

Meg:
 Oh, well, that's only fair, because, after all, I did hide him from

Lois:
 Peter, Meg's been suspended from school.

Peter:
 That's okay, whatever she wants to do.

Lois:
 She cracked three kids' skulls open. Ever since she got out of prison, she's been completely out of control.

Chris:
 Oh, um, sorry, um... So what do your parents do?

Stewie:
 Is he playing a dick?

Quagmire:
 If you have sex with her, you give her all the power, and if you don't have sex with her, you're gay.

Quagmire:
 to Angela Thanks for having me in your home, and I would have had sex with you but Peter neglected to tell me you were a dumpster fire.

Peter:
 So you gonna introduce me to your little friends?

Stewie:
 That’s Trap-Jaw, that’s Optimus Prime, that’s Destro, and that’s a Care Bear.

Peter:
 You having a tea party?

Stewie:
 No, we’re working out a land deal. Trap-Jaw is trying to get a variance to build an unpermitted structure within 10 feet of Optimus Prime’s property line. Destro’s the city councilman who’s telling Trap-Jaw that he has to file it as an accessory structure and even then it can only be built at the rear of the lot. And the Care Bear is just a Care Bear.

Stewie:
 When you jumped through my ceiling, you let an owl in. I know they're supposed to be wise, but all it did was shriek and throw-up half-digested mice.

Brian:
 You've had energy bars this whole time? You idiot!

Stewie:
 Not energy bars. Jenny Craig Anytime Bars. And you bitched yourself out a bite.

Brian:
 All right, I'm sorry, all right? Can I have one, please?

Stewie:
 All right.

Brian:
 Can you give me a caramel one?

Stewie:
 No. You can have, um, um, you can have, um - You can have strawberry yogurt.

Brian:
 I don't like yogurt.

Stewie:
 Picky for someone who eats the same food out of a bowl on the floor every night.

Brian:
 Okay, I get it.

Stewie:
 A bowl that starts in the kitchen and ends up in the living room.

Brian:
 Shut up.

Stewie:
 Forgets four seconds later that he ate it.

Stewie:
 Ooh, harsh tone. You just got bumped down to coconut mint.

Stewie:
 Wanting to kill yourself... Well, I think that's pretty selfish of you.

Brian:
 How is that selfish?

Stewie:
 What would I do if you weren't here? Hmm? You're the only one who makes my life bearable.

Brian:
 I thought you said I was the best of a bad situation.

Stewie:
 I was just trying to hurt you because you hurt me. But the truth is you're my only friend, Brian. lf I didn't have you, I'd be lost.

Brian:
 Ah, you'd be okay.

Stewie:
 No, I wouldn't. I don't really care for anybody else. Just you. You're the only one I like.

Brian:
 Well, thanks.

Stewie:
 uncomfortable I like you a lot. I guess you could say I really like you. I would even dare to go a little further, perhaps. I care a great deal about you. A very great deal. Maybe even deeper than that. mumbling I... I love you. I mean, you know, not in like a, "Hey, let's have an underpants party," or whatever grown-ups do when they're in love. I mean, I love you as one loves another person whom one simply cannot do without.

Brian:
 Well, I I love you too, Stewie.

Stewie:
 You give my life purpose. And maybe that's enough. Because that's just about the greatest gift one friend can give another.

Stewie:
 Will you read to me?

Stewie:
 What?! What the hell?! What's wrong with you?!

Brian:
 I HAD SEX WITH HER!

Stewie:
 What?!

Brian:
 I HAD SEX WITH HER AT THE MARRIOTT!!

Stewie:
 screams Why!?

Brian:
 I didn't know! I didn't know it was her!

Stewie:
 OH, MY GOD!

Brian:
 HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN?! WHEN THEY MOVE TO A NEW PLACE, THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO NOTIFY THE NEIGHBORHOOD! THAT'S HOW IT WORKS!

Stewie:
 He didn't actually move! He's just visiting!!

Brian:
 Hey!

Brian:
 I fucked your dad!

Quagmire:
 What the hell was that about, who were those guys!?

Peter:
 You think they were following us?

Quagmire:
 Aw, Joe, that's so dumb.

Peter:
 Hey, you know, Cleveland, you better hide the markers from your kids. Somebody colored in your Jesus.

Lois:
 Why you stuck-up, half-witted, scruffy-looking... nerfherder!

Stewie:
 C'mon Luke, join the dark side. It's really cool.

Stewie:
 Uh, there's me, the Emperor, this guy Scott. You'll meet him, he's awesome. Oh, and James Caan.

Lois:
 Oh no! We've lost Han! They've taken him to Jabba's palace!

Quagmire:
 Well, even though we know exactly where he is, we should rescue him in three years.

Brian:
 Why are you wearing Han's clothes? to the home audience Seriously, watch the actual movie. Lando is wearing Han's clothes in this scene. It's really weird.

Stewie:
 Join me and we can rule the galaxy as father and son! Y'know? I mean it doesn't have to be as father and son, it can be just as, a-y'know- as two really close guys who just happen to be men y'know, just, two good-lookin' guys sharin' a cramped office runnin' the galaxy together — y'know just, gettin' the job done y'know — maybe we, maybe we do it occasionally, but it's not weird, y'know, cause we're just, two guys with ragin' goals, y'know? I mean it's not even about the doin' it part — but thats a part of it — but it's not- it's not the whole thing.

Lois:
 through the ships loud-speakers Luke, if that's you, wave your right hand! beat I said wave your right hand! beat Your right hand!

Lois:
 Peter, this is Naomi.

Peter:
 Wait? You mean you too used to, you know, bump Japanese cartoon monkey logo mouths?

Lois:
 Well, let's just say Naomi and I experimented quite a bit in college.

Peter:
 No way! My wife messed around with another chick! Thank you, God!

Lois:
 Well, I think we made the right decision. I mean, sure. Havin' a baby costs a fortune. There's cutbacks on things we love. There's diapers and cryin' and late nights with no sleep. Flu shots and mumps and driver's ed and college tuition. But you know what? It's one more person to share the world with. Another little voice in the back seat of the car. One more Griffin to love and to love us in return.

Peter:
 to the home audience We had the abortion.

Stewie:
 to Brian She doesn't know what "mister" means.

Stewie:
 after Stephanie is killed I can't help but feel this would be sadder if she wasn't so heavy.

Lois:
 Oh my God! It was him! It was James Woods! He killed Stephanie!

Peter:
 Jeez, I knew he was crazy but I didn't think he was a murderer.

Lois:
 Oh, my God! Peter, back it up!

Peter:
 Oh, really, Lois? I thought I might drive forward. I thought that-that might be a fun thing to do.

Chris:
 Stop fighting!

Lois:
 With a killer in the house?

Stewie:
 In a rapper like voice Killer in da hoouuuuse.

Peter:
 scared Oh, my God! I just realised something. James Woods hates me the most. That means he's probably gonna kill me next! cowboy voice Well, I reckon if I was a cattle rustler, I wouldn't be afraid.

Lois:
 Oh, Peter, that's good.

Peter:
 I know, Lois.

Peter:
 dressed in armor Check it out, I'm a robot from outer space! Hang on, I'm coming down. Go Go Gadget Skis! Jumps down and crashes into Joe who is knocked out by a vase Uh-oh.

Stewie:
 Neh, my secret room's bigger.

Chris:
 Um, okay.

Chris:
 Um...what does that mean?

Brian:
 Muriel? opens next door Muriel? Muriel? sniffs Nothing.

Stewie:
 Well, you actually know what she smells like?

Brian:
 I know what everybody smells like.

Stewie:
 Carl?

Brian:
 Cheetos.

Stewie:
 Mort?

Brian:
 Pennies.

Stewie:
 Derek?

Brian:
 Brut.

Stewie:
 Joe?

Brian:
 Feces.

Stewie:
 Consuela?

Brian:
 Pledge.

Stewie:
 Seamus?

Brian:
 Wood.

Stewie:
 Quagmire?

Stewie:
 Wow.

Brian:
 You know, I..have to admit, before this Muriel thing, I-I thought you might be the murderer.

Stewie:
 Oh, my God! So insulted. Y-- Trust me, if this were my work, it would be much more artful. There's a poetry to what I do. You know how I would've killed James Woods?

Brian:
 How?

Stewie:
 I would have electrocuted him causing a temporary paralysis, and while he was still conscious but unable to move, I would've reached into his anus and pulled out his lower intestine slowly, hand over hand like a fancy magician scarf trick. Then I would fashion the intestine in a crude giraffe and give it to his children as a Christmas stocking stuffer...and then as his eyes start to close in final submission to death's cold embrace, I'd point to the ceiling and say, "Is that your card?" And stuck to the ceiling is the card that he picked earlier. Oh, I forget to tell you, he picked a card earlier.

Brian:
 Wow! You're an artist.

Stewie:
 Oh, thanks, you're nice. I screwed that up.

Quagmire:
 Wait a minute... something's not right here. sniffs We're short one vagina in this room!

Peter:
 after finding Stephanie's underpants Oh, my God! Are those Stephanie's underpants?

Quagmire:
 Oh, God.

Stewie:
 Looks like the crotch got chewed on by a walrus mouth.

Lois:
 laughs Look, it's got flowers! Ha, I mean why bother? Who's gonna see 'em?

Chris:
 Maybe someone in space. everyone laughs

Quagmire:
 Come on, guys, can't we all just be glad she's dead?

Stewie:
 after shooting Diane, who almost shot Lois If anyone's going to take the bitch down, it's gonna be me.

Lois:
 Oh, yeah? Let me ask, what did you think of the movie Titanic?

Brian:
 Horrible, one of the worst movies ever made.

Lois:
 Mm-hm, what about Slumdog Millionaire?

Brian:
 Overrated, just a terrible movie.

Lois:
 Cocktail.

Brian:
 Actually, not a bad film. You know, as classically structured cinema, Cocktail was one of the best films of its era.

Peter:
 Oh my God! Carter and his whore gasp in shock Mr. Pewterschmidt, you're having an affair? Ewww!

Meg:
 From your sister?!

Chris:
 Some bitch who cares!

Meg:
 coughs Oh, my God! Oh! We did so much!

Chris:
 SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

Meg:
 WE'RE DISGUSTING!! WE'RE A DISGRACE TO OUR FAMILY!!!

Quagmire:
 not surprised Oh, hi, Brian. Just waitin' for Santa, like everyone else.

Brian:
 Cool, cool. We'll just hang with you guys. approaches Quagmire's niece Hey, who's this little guy? Is this your nephew? Hey, buddy! You excited to see Santa? Hope you've been a good boy this year.

Quagmire:
 holds her close No, sweetheart, you're not dying, 'cause we're gonna see Santa, and he's gonna give you a new brain. turns to Brian, unhappily gritting his teeth Get outta here, Brian. Just get outta here.

Peter:
 Oh, yeah, Drew. I wanna say hi to Lois, Brian, Chris, Stewie, Meg, Joe, Bonnie, Quagmire, Cleveland, Mort, Seamus, Adam West, Dr. Hartman, Bruce, Carter, Babs, Tom Tucker, Angela, Opie, Carl, Herbert, Jillian, Consuela, Giant Chicken, Greased-Up Deaf Guy!

Peter:
 I think we should go live with Mom.

Chris:
 Meg has something she wants to tell you.

Meg:
 Chris, please, I'm sorry.

Chris:
 Say it!

Meg:
 Chris is a failure!

Quagmire:
 Uh, okay.

Chris:
 Now we're goin' to the Swansons'!

Lois:
 Oh, my God! I think Chris is havin' a heart attack!

Peter:
 sits his wife back down We're not opposed to leave the table.

Quagmire:
 admittedly Yeah, maybe.

Peter:
 You're tellin' me. I always wanted a brother or sister, but instead I got a broster.

Brian:
 Aw, don't feel bad, Peter. Hey, I know what'll cheer ya up. leaves Hey, where the hell's my banana thing?

Stewie:
 appears behind the couch in Brian's banana suit and sings and dances It's Peanut Butter Jelly Time!

Peter:
 laughs Oh, my God! Oh, Stewie! That is so funny! I did not see that comin'! leaves

Meg:
 dancing Oh, it's beautiful! Everything is so beautiful! Come dance with me, Dad!

Peter:
 Soon, Meg. Soon. But first, I must inhale. inhales And again. inhales And again. inhales, pause Let's go to the Hollywood Hills and kill a bunch of people.

Peter:
 Shirts off! I want to see who's got bigger pecs. tears off his shirt

Peter:
 Well, they look better when they're oiled up. to Chris Pass the salad dressing. Oh no, it's an almost empty squeeze bottle. Hang on. squirts whatever is left onto his body Eh, it's all out. to Chris There's dressing on that salad! Gimme that salad! puts some salad onto his body Yeah, who's the better man now, Ross?!

Peter:
 Oh yeah? Is that right? Well, so are we!

Lois:
 We are?

Peter:
 Alright, Griffins, on the ground, we're goin' second. Let's turn two here. Ground ball's a double play ball plays in second. Let's look sharp. Tough D, tough D. Let's flash that leather. Head in the game. Play's at second. This infield is a Great Wall of China, nothin's gettin' past us. Good D, behind ya, Bri, good D all around. a fastball punches Peter in the throat, changing his voice to sound like Stewie I'm okay, everyone. Don't worry. I am okay. My voice sounds weird, I know, but I feel fine.

Quagmire:
 Thanks to you, TV's a vast wasteland. You know how I know that phrase? I read it in a book, you monster!

Peter:
 I'm Peter Griffin. I'm the guy who ruined television, and I'm the guy who's gonna fix it!

Peter:
 Aha! Looks like this is one we beat you to!

Peter:
 I learned how to do a somersault. Peter tries to do it, but falls over Did I do it?

Stewie:
 You bastard!! You've been using my time machine to nail your bar skanks!

Brian:
 Oh, come on! They're not all bad.

Peter:
 Oh, for cryin' out loud. walks up to the thermostat and turns up the heat

Brian:
 points at a bottle Is that the Ipecac bottle? suddenly realizes Oh, no! No, please, not this!

Stewie:
 Oh, God. It's not gonna be coming out of us, it's gonna be going... throws up

Brian:
 panicked Oh, dear God! throws up WHAT THE HELL?!

Stewie:
 I don't wanna! I don't wanna- !! regurgitates

Chris:
 Dad, I'm scared! vomits and cries

Stewie:
 Oh God, this is so disgusting! I think I'm gonna puke! regurgitates FUCK!

Brian:
 Stewie, I don't care what it takes. We've GOT to fix this! We just ate so much vomit!

Stewie:
 Watch your back, Simpsons, we're less than halfway there.

Peter:
 Let's use our eyes ... to see.

Quagmire:
 through clenched teeth Peter, what'd I say about you volunteering me for shit?

Lois:
 Do me, Peter. Do me right in the basement.

Stewie:
 In my office! Now!

Quagmire:
 Here ya go. tilts popcorn containter towards girl with his crotch.

Meg:
 Just putting on my lipstick! shaves, cuts Dammit!

Lois:
 Oh, I wouldn't worry about it, Bonnie. I've put Stewie in the oven a buncha times. As long as you come to your senses in 15 minutes, everything's fine.

Meg:
 So you guys are goin' to Bethlehem, huh? I went there one time on a donkey's night out. Oh my God; I got sooo hammered!

Peter:
 trying to have sex with Mary/Lois I can't believe how hard you're making me work.

Lois:
 Okay, I think I got it. How's this?... in Consuela's accent No, no, no.

Peter:
 Aw cool! Hey, c'mon, Brian. Try it with me. both enter. Guide closes the door; both scream and exit with heads in each other's bodies

Peter:
 Things got crazy so fast!!

Peter:
 We were talkin' about Meg. We-we call her Chris so she doesn't know.

Meg:
 off-camera Fuck you!

Peter:
 A week ago, we call him stupid and now he's given tours at a space shuttle. Negative reinforcement, that's the key. kicks Stewie Right, stupid?

Stewie:
 No, thank you. I prefer to die giving you the finger. Stewie does so

Meg:
 touring the shuttle with Chris So do you know how all this stuff works?

Brian:
 as they are being blasted off You know what? You only live once. I am sticking my head out the window. he does YES! THIS IS THE BEST PART OF WHATEVER'S SO ENJOYABLE ABOUT THIS!

Stewie:
 What the fuck are you talking about? The play I wrote, have you seen it?

Stewie:
 It's filled with terrible double entendres, puns and stolen bits. There's a line in there from "Seinfeld".

Peter:
 Where will you two be fucking going on your scummymoon? And can I plan your bridal golden shower?

Lois:
 Welcome to our home, Charmisse. Sit on my lips you like. That chair with the garbage bag taped over it looks pretty good.

Quagmire:
 What the fuck is going on with my life?!

Stewie:
 (Furiously) NONE OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS WHAT HAPPENED!

Brian:
 (Angrily) Geez, you kissed your mother with that mouth? (Stewie throws up again while Brian recoils)

Quagmire:
 after sex I thought we could get some breakfast.

Chris:
 I'm not really tired yet.

Quagmire:
 Impatiently I said I wasn't!

Quagmire:
 Joe, you telling me not to has no effect on me whatsoever. I will not get married.

Quagmire:
 Impatiently Yeah that's what I said... I wouldn't do it!

Quagmire:
 Angrily J-Joe, you realize what you're telling me not to do, I already am not doing! I know I should never meet one of those sex operators ever!

Peter:
 Oh, guilty is the other one? exasperated Well, I don't know.

Peter:
 Enough!... was a movie with Jennifer Lopez that did not live to expectations.

Stewie:
 There's a maniac out there! He's cutting people's power off, breaking into their homes and slitting their throats! the lights suddenly go out ...And we're dead.

Peter:
 Lift up the shades, there's a man on the wing! Joe lifts up the shades I'm the man on the wing.

Stewie:
 weakly You... look... fat.

Peter:
 sighs I'm bored.

Peter:
 in a deep voice I even won a deep voice contest with Joe.

Meg:
 puts make up on corpse Wow, that really works. Hm, maybe I'll try that on myself.

Meg:
 Oh, eh... You have what we call a "closed-casket-face".

Lois:
 to Peter I forgot you don't even know your ass from a hole in the ground.

Lois:
 Oh my god. You mean like as in D-R-U-G-S? Aren't those I-L-L-E-G-A-L?

Lois:
 Uh oh, someone's getting cranky. picks up Stewie I think he needs an N-A-P.

Brian:
 Oh my God, Stewie. It worked! We're in Vegas.

Brian:
 jumps off the balcony but Stewie doesn't 3!

Stewie:
 holds onto the railing I'm sorry, I can't, I want to live! I didn't really think we were gonna do it!

Brian:
 falls to his death YOU DICK!

Stewie:
 Oh, my God, Brian! Brian, no! Good Lord, what have I done?! tries to run out of the room I better get the hell out of here! trips over his backpack and finds the money the other pair had won What the deuce? Where did this come from? slides the money tops Well, looks like Archibald Meatpants is gonna have a fun night.

Brian:
 Oh my god! This place is a dump!

Stewie:
 looking at a leaflet Let's not be so quick to judge. Says here there's a continental breakfast. Oh, the continent is Africa.

Brian:
 Stewie, this place is a complete pit! Don't ya think it's weird we have to keep checking in every 20 minutes?

Stewie:
 continues reading Also, the porn's free, but we have to watch it from the lobby.

Peter:
 to Lois I want you on my team for everything... except for sports.

Lois:
 So, what happened? You find your treasure?

Peter:
 No, I realised something after you left; It's not the treasure that matters. All that really matters is the money you get in exchange for the treasure. I guess I had to learn that the hard way.

Peter:
 glumly Welp, now we know. I can taste what he eats.

Quagmire:
 Remind me again. Chip is that African kid you adopted?

Peter:
 No that's Chocolate Chip. We gave him back to Kenya.

Quagmire:
 That's my word.

Peter:
 Oh, he's eating. shouts at the door We'll come back when you're done eating!

Peter:
 Well, sometimes Quagmire likes to hang out under all the clutter in my garage, so why don't we just start sorting stuff and throwing stuff away, but obviously checking with me first before you throw stuff away.

Chris:
 I don't know. lifts up his shirt and sees his back covered with bacne Yeah.

Brian:
 sees something terrible in the package, it's revealed to be Peter's own penis he cut off Aah! Oh God!

Peter:
 laughs What's in the box, Brian? I got you good! Blood is coming out and comes to Peter's pants I don't feel right. I want it back. Collapses

Peter:
 Yes, yes, I swear.

Brian:
 You gonna keep 'em on?

Peter:
 Yes, I promise. I'll never bother you again with my body. Please, just make this stop!

Chris:
 Dad, can you give me a ride to the-- screams What is that thing?! Make it go away! claws his eyes out

Lois:
 What's going on in here? seeing that Brian has shaved off all his fur Oh my god, is that a fuckin' rat?! Peter, hold it down, I'm gettin' the gun!

Stewie:
 sitting near the hem of Peter's robe on the floor He's wearing a rubber.

Chris:
 What are you... starts to choke and struggle

Stewie:
 in an Italian-accented whisper You break-a my heart, Chris. You break-a my heart.

Stewie:
 sees a car heading towards Brian Brian, look out! the car runs over Brian, breaking the hockey stick, and the toy net Aah, Brian! runs to him

Lois:
 runs out of the house with Peter, Chris, and Meg and saw Brian hurt Oh, my God! runs to him Brian! Brian, can you hear me?!

Stewie:
 Damn it, Brian, you can't die! We were gonna do so many things together! We were gonna become windsurfers! I was gonna be a little better than you, but we were both gonna be good!

Lois:
 You guys, I think- I think Brian's trying to say something.

Brian:
 last words You... You've given me a wonderful life... I love you all. smiles gently before quietly passing away

Chris:

Lois:
 voice breaking Yes, Chris... I'm afraid... I'm afraid that our Brian is dead! sobs

Quagmire:
 meditating I can be Giggity. I can be Goo.

Peter:
 nodding Chris, that's wildly inappropriate.

Stewie:
 Oh, oh, w... we could, we could never do something like that, Brian! starts to fade away

Stewie:
 looks at himself I think... my timeline has been erased! The timeline where you died no longer exists! Merry Christmas, Brian. finally fades away

Stewie:
 All I can say, Brian, is you've been making really creepy eye contact with me all morning, and I want it to stop right now.

Stewie:
 comes from the future and sees Brian on the street. He sees the car heading right for him and runs to him Brian, look out! pushes him out of the way, letting the hockey stick and toy net to get broken by the car

Stewie:
 You're alive, my friend! hugs him

Brian:
 What? Of course, l'm alive. What the hell's going on here?

Stewie:
 Brian, points at the car that car killed you, and when it did, a little part of me died as well. I couldn't live without you, so I came back from the future to save your life.

Peter:
 Jack and the Beanstalk. And that title could be a fairy tale or a porn. Let's find out.

Quagmire:
 Where'd that thing come from? It's blocking my view of Little Miss Muffet's truffet.

Quagmire:
 to Peter You can't even walk and chew gum at the same time!

Peter:
 I'm doin' somethin'. chews One thing at a time!

Quagmire:
 DAMN IT, PETER, THAT'S IT! I AM DONE! I'M DONE WITH YOU! I'M DONE WITH ALL YOUR CRAP, I NEVER WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN! THIS FRIENDSHIP IS OVER! leaves

Peter:
 Well fine! I don't need your friendship anyway.

Peter:
 Now this is a gun without a safety.

Peter:
 after realizing what he just told Quagmire Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! No, no, I was supposed to offer, and then you were supposed to say, "No, Peter, I'm not gonna shoot you, although I do appreciate the gesture."

Quagmire:
 Hand me the gun, Peter.

Peter:
 I, uh, pass the test?

Peter:
 under his breath You do everything gross.

Peter:
 No, no, no. The really cartoony gays.

Peter:
 And you still won't give us an Emmy?! Come on!! If Modern Family did that joke, you'd be carryin' 'em around on your shoulders!!

Peter:
 Okay, are you a television set of the Internet?

Peter:
 You shall battle to the death, or the winner will be given his freedom! Why are you looking at me like that?

Lois:
 Peter, would you like a glass of-- sees a decapitated Peter with a bloodied neck OH MY GOD! I TOLD YOU NOT TO PLAY GOD WITH THOSE ANTS!

Lois:
 Oh, no, I'm not! You're an idiot!

Peter:
 Hurt You don't mean that.

Stewie:
 Stewie looks Facebook on the phone I already got a Facebook friend request from the dad. Is that weird?

Lois:
 Peter, I have put up with your nonsense for 20 years, but today you crossed the line! You let the helpless baby in the public park. And that's only an idiot would do!

Chris:
 to a passing waiter Kill that one.

Peter:
 I don't hate ya, Meg. You're my kid.

Cleveland:
 Wassup?! The Cleveland Show theme music plays as Cleveland approaches the guys

Peter:
 normally Oh, hey, Cleveland!

Quagmire:
 Wait, don't you have a show to do...chuckles Oh wait, that's right!

Cleveland:
 Alright, I knew this was comin', everybody gimme your best shot.

Quagmire:
 Oh, my G... Where do I even begin? Y'know, it's not a good sign that this is the first time a lot of people are realizing you had a show!

Cleveland:
 We did about the same as Bob's Burgers.

Quagmire:
 The talking bear was so bad, Seth MacFarlane quit voicing him after Season 2.

Quagmire:
 laughs It worked out okay in movie form.

Peter:
 Unga-Bunga! Unga-Bunga! Unga-Bunga!

Peter:
 carrying mattresses Unga-Bunga! Unga-Bunga! Unga-Bunga!

Peter:
 Two guys running at each other with mattresses and, um, and that's kind of it.

Chris:
 Stop explaining it to the dog, let's do this!

Peter:
 Oh, Chris, look! Mom's naked!

Peter:
 smacking Chris with his mattress You creep. Chris crashes into and breaks the TV

Stewie:
 (gasps) No!

Peter:
 smacking Lois with his mattress Unga-Bunga!

Stewie:
 You imbeciles! you've ruined my night! I asked you to do one thing in this house!

Stewie:
 I don't want to watch it upstairs on the small TV, I want to watch it downstairs on the big TV! his face turns red as he starts crying I WANT TO WATCH MY SHOW! (crying)

Lois:
 Oh no, Stewie's havin' a tantrum. Come here, sweetie.

Lois:
 OW! Screw you, you little turd!

Meg:
 enters the living room What's all that noise? sees Stewie upset Aw, do you want a hug from your big sister? picks Stewie up and is headbutted OW!

Lois:
 You've earned yourself a time-out, young man. Now, you stay in here until you can behave. she closed the door

Stewie:
 I HATE YOU! You always ruin everything! God, it's a family of idiots! I wish...I wish I was never born! he sees Rupert wearing a fire helmet Not tonight, Rupert. I'm much too upset.

Lois:
 Oh my god, Peter. What happened to your hair?!

Peter:
 I don't know. I'm bald! You did this! What the hell's the matter with you!?

Lois:
 I didn't do it. but you look really cool.

Peter:
 Lois, what the hell did you do? I just got a note from Goodwill thanking me for donating all my porn.

Peter:
 Well, you know something, I'm starting to think whoever wrote that is right!

Lois:
 Well, maybe I don't want to live with someone who doesn't respect me!

Lois:
 And where are you gonna go?! You got nothing else and nobody else!!

Stewie:
 And now for the closer.
